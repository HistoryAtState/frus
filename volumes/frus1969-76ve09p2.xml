                <p>This electronic-only volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the foreign
                    policy decision making of the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and
                    Gerald R. Ford. This volume documents the formulation of U.S. policy toward the
                    Middle East region as a whole, as well as the development of bilateral
                    relationships with the countries of the Arabian Peninsula, from February 15,
                    1973, until December 28, 1976. During this period, Presidents Nixon and Ford and
                    Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger devoted much of their attention to
                    managing the political, economic and strategic effects of the October 1973
                    Arab-Israeli war on U.S. interests in the region. Though the United States
                    enjoyed cordial relations with every state on the Arabian Peninsula, with the
                    exception of the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen, the U.S. Government was
                    criticized for its relationship with and assistance to Israel during the war.
                    The 1973–1974 oil embargo, led by Arab members of the Organization of the
                    Petroleum Exporting Countries against the United States and Western Europe,
                    compounded the war’s impact and further complicated U.S. relations with most
                    Middle Eastern states. In addition to raising international oil prices and
                    creating a troubling financial situation for the United States, the embargo
                    diminished U.S. prestige in the region at a moment when the Soviet Union’s
                    influence in the eastern Mediterranean, the Horn of Africa, and South Asia
                    appeared to be on the rise.</p>
                <p>In response to this situation, the United States strengthened diplomatic
                    relations with recently-independent Gulf states, who were responsive to offers
                    of U.S. development expertise, technical assistance, and military aid. The Nixon
                    and Ford administrations also courted Saudi Arabia as a political and economic
                    partner, bolstered the modest U.S. military presence in the region, and expanded
                    Washington’s diplomatic footprint with the establishment of new Embassies in the
                    Gulf.</p>

                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Foreign Service Institute, under the direction of
                    the General Editor, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the
                    series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official
                    regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of
                    documents for the series on March 26, 1925. Those regulations, with minor
                    modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Authorization
                    Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President George H.W. Bush
                    on October 28, 1991, established a new statutory charter for the preparation of
                    the series. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department
                    of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 <gloss target="#t_USC_1"
                        >U.S.C.</gloss> 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series must include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of
                    major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The
                    statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg:
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purpose of concealing
                    a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded.</p>

                    much attention to the Middle East region. Though the United States enjoyed
                    cordial relations with every state on the Arabian Peninsula, with the exception

                    assistance to Israel during the war. As a result, the 1973–1974 oil embargo, led
                    by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Arab member states against
                    the United States and Western Europe, further complicated <gloss

                    governmental control over oil production and a rise in oil prices created a
                    troubling financial and diplomatic situation for the United States. Second, the
                    embargo diminished <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> prestige in the region
                    at the same time that Soviet aid for Iraq and the People’s Democratic Republic
                    of Yemen enhanced Soviet influence in the Middle East, the long-term effect of
                    which developed into a central aspect of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    strategy in the region.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="V" xml:id="pg_V"/>
                <p>In response to the oil embargo, the United States strengthened diplomatic

                    and in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"

                        >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> in Bahrain. In addition to a valuable new partnership
                    with Egypt, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy toward the Arabian
                    Peninsula relied heavily on the preservation of relations with Jordan and the
                    development of new and stronger relationships with Oman, Yemen, and the Gulf
                    states, greatly shaping the diplomatic landscape of the post-war period through
                    a comprehensive strategic picture of the Middle East region’s political and
                    military future.</p>
                <p>Despite progress in diplomatic relations and a growing <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                    eventually including the Horn of Africa. Several National Security Study
                    Memoranda reflected aspects of the changing, but still critical, economic and
                    strategic situation in the Middle East, defining policy on the expansion of
                    relations with Iran and Saudi Arabia and the countering of Soviet diplomatic

                        >U.S.</gloss> foreign policy was clear and in fundamental agreement with

                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign

                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Editing and Publishing
                    Division. The documents are reproduced as exactly as possible, including <pb

                    each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation
                    are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical
                    errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are
                    printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the
                    original text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume. In telegrams, the telegram number (including special designators
                    such as <gloss target="#t_Secto_1">Secto</gloss>) is printed at the start of the
                    text of the telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in
                    footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from

                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 <gloss target="#t_USC_1">USC</gloss> 2111 note), the
                    National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has custody of the Nixon
                    Presidential historical materials. The requirements of the PRMPA and
                    implementing regulations govern access to the Nixon Presidential historical
                    materials. The PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA to
                    review for additional restrictions in order to ensure the protection of the
                    privacy rights of former Nixon White House officials, since these officials were
                    not given the opportunity to separate their personal materials from public
                    papers. Thus, the PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA
                    formally to notify the Nixon estate and former Nixon White House staff members
                    that the agency is scheduling for public release Nixon White House historical

                <p>Access to the Nixon White House tape recordings is governed by the terms of the
                    PRMPA and an access agreement with the Office of Presidential Libraries of the
                    National Archives and Records Administration and the Nixon estate. In February
                    1971, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> initiated a
                    voice-activated taping system in the Oval Office of the White House and,
                    subsequently, in the President’s Office in the Executive Office Building, Camp
                    David, the Cabinet Room, and White House and Camp David telephones. The
                    audiotapes include conversations of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> with his Assistant for National Security Affairs,
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, other White House
                    aides, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>, other
                    Cabinet officers, members of Congress, and key foreign officials. The clarity of
                    the voices on the tape recordings is often very poor, but the editor has made
                    every effort to verify the accuracy of the transcripts produced here. Readers
                    are advised that the tape recording is the official document; the transcript
                    represents an interpretation of that document. Through the use of digital audio
                    and other advances in tech<pb facs="0009" n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII"/>nology, the
                    Office of the Historian has been able to enhance the tape recordings and over
                    time produce more accurate transcripts. The result is that some transcripts
                    printed here may differ from transcripts of the same conversations printed in
                    previous <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes. The most accurate
                    transcripts possible, however, cannot substitute for listening to the
                    recordings. Readers are urged to consult the recordings themselves for a full
                    appreciation of those aspects of the conversations that cannot be captured in a
                    transcript, such as the speakers’ inflections and emphases that may convey
                    nuances of meaning, as well as the larger context of the discussion. </p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526, as amended, on Classified
                    National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government, and
                    the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents of those
                    governments. The declassification review of this volume, which began in 2007 and
                    was completed in 2018 resulted in the decision to withhold 15 documents in full,
                    excisions of a paragraph or more in 11 documents, and minor excisions of less
                    than a paragraph in 25 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the record presented in this volume provides an accurate
                    and comprehensive account of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign policy
                    on the Middle East region. </p>

                <p>Research for this volume was completed through special access to restricted
                    documents at the Nixon Presidential Materials Project, the Ford Presidential
                    Library, the Library of Congress, and other agencies. While all the material
                    printed in this volume has been declassified, some of it is extracted from still
                    classified documents. In the time since the research for this volume was
                    completed, the Nixon Presidential Materials have been transferred to the Nixon
                    Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California. The Nixon
                    Presidential Library staff is processing and declassifying many of the documents
                    used in this volume, but they may not be available in their entirety at the time
                    of publication.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for <hi rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>,
                    1969–1976, Volume E–9, Part 2</p>
                <p>The 1973–1976 period was, in large part, a continuation of the complicated
                    pre-embargo period, as the United States attempted to manage and adapt to the
                    changing relationships among oil corporations, newly wealthy Arab states, and a
                    strategic situation fundamentally altered by the success of the 1973–1974 oil
                    embargo. Coupled with these issues was <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                        >Kissinger</persName>’s desire to create a new, stable, strategic order in
                    the Middle East and Indian Ocean region. Thus, nearly every department involved
                    in the crafting of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign policy was
                    involved at the highest level, especially concerning the developing relationship
                    between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To a somewhat lesser
                    extent, the Departments of State and Defense, and the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                        >NSC</gloss> consulted in the formulation of policy concerning the British
                    departure from its base at Masirah, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> deployment, and new military
                    and diplomatic ties to Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Yemens.
                    Documentation for this volume necessarily came from a variety of sources and all
                    levels of the administration policy-making apparatus.</p>
                <p>The holdings of the Nixon Presidential Materials Staff at Archives II,
                    specifically the National Security Council Files, are the most valuable resource
                    for <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration foreign policy
                    at the highest level. It is in these files that high-level memoranda and
                    discussions may be found relevant to the countries of the Arabian Peninsula. For
                    the larger strategic issues, the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                    Institutional Files, or H-Files, are central sources for NSSMs, NSDMs, and
                    related materials. Box H–068 in particular holds much of the record for
                    strategic and economic discussions of Saudi Arabia, and the copious materials
                    related to the attempt to formulate a new regional strategy that occupied the
                        <gloss target="#t_WSAG_1">WSAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SRG_1"
                        >SRG</gloss> in the aftermath of the October War and embargo. These
                    materials are interspersed with those more directly concerned with the war and
                    embargo, making them perhaps the single most important source on <gloss
                        target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> foreign military and financial policy for the
                    entire 1969–1974 period.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="XV" xml:id="pg_XV"/>
                <p>In addition to the Institutional Files, within the same holdings are ancillary
                    materials of great importance. The Saunders Files are notable, holding draft
                    materials and a critical set of procedural memoranda tracing the path of policy
                    through the departmental and <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> bureaucracy.
                    The Kissinger Office Files, while less complete, are also useful in this regard.
                    Additionally, the Agency Files and the Country Files are valuable, the latter
                    especially so for Saudi Arabia. Much of the attendant supporting material is
                    available in Record Group 59, the Department of State Central Files, although it
                    is often clear from an examination of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                    files that cable traffic of particular importance was copied and centralized for
                    the use of principals and <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff.
                    Collections of <gloss target="#t_Exdis_1">Exdis</gloss> and <gloss
                        target="#t_Nodis_1">Nodis</gloss> cables are far more prominent in the Nixon
                    Presidential Materials than in the larger, more dilute <gloss target="#t_RG_1"
                        >RG</gloss> 59 collection. Of markedly lesser importance for policy making
                    are the Presidential Correspondence Files, Presidential Trip Files, and VIP
                    Visits Files. These are also valuable for those researchers concerned with
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s shuttles, oil, and the
                    Middle East peace process. For <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi Arabia
                    or <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Gulf state relations, the memoranda of
                    conversation and correspondence between <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> and King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>
                    are the documents of interest.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald R. Ford</persName> papers at the Ford
                    Library are of equal importance to those of President <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                        >Ford</persName> implemented many of the policies in the Middle East
                    formulated by the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration,
                    particularly those related to the broader financial relationship with Saudi
                    Arabia. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s concurrent tenure as
                    National Security Adviser and Secretary of State also makes an examination of
                    the Ford papers a necessity. The primary sources for the Middle East are the
                    Presidential Country Files for Middle East and South Asia, and these are
                    supplemented by the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff Convenience Files
                    for the same area. The Trip Briefing Books and Cables for <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, the Backchannel Messages, and
                    the Memoranda of Conversation files are all of great importance for establishing
                    the details of <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s repeated
                    trips to the Middle East, especially when he frequently stopped in Jidda, Ta’if,
                    or Riyadh to brief Saudi leaders on his negotiations with Syria, Egypt, and
                    Israel, and discuss bilateral issues at the same time. As with the Nixon
                    Presidential Materials, most of the material on NSSMs, <gloss target="#t_SRG_1"
                        >SRG</gloss> meetings, and <gloss target="#t_WSAG_1">WSAG</gloss> are to be
                    found in the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Institutional Files
                    (H-Files).</p>
                <p>The most complete record of Department of State actions is the aforementioned
                    Record Group 59. For this volume, the files of the <gloss target="#t_POL_1"
                        >POL</gloss> series related to the countries of the peninsula were of value.
                    The FN Saudi Arabia files are also of importance for discussions of petrodollar
                    and military contracting topics. Also in the same collection are the Lot Files,
                    of which the <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> Lot File,
                    containing memoranda of conversation and the records of the Regional Staff
                    Meetings are extremely valuable and not reproduced elsewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI"/>
                <p>By the time of this volume’s publication, many, if not all, of the Embassy and
                    Desk records currently in the custody of the Department of State will have been
                    transferred to Archives II and incorporated into Record Group 84. These Embassy
                    files are of enormous value, and the Embassy files for Saudi Arabia, in
                    particular, are meticulously kept and provide a critical set of parallel
                    documentation supporting the high level discussions of policy in the <gloss
                        target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> and Departments of Defense and State. The
                    Embassy files of the smaller posts, while less complete, are still crucial
                    sources for policy discussions on topics such as Masirah Island, arms sales to
                    Yemen Arab Republic and Jordan, and the Dhofar conflict.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry A. Kissinger</persName> Papers in the
                    Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress were absolutely invaluable for
                    this volume. These papers contain copies of telegrams and memoranda of
                    conversation, along with copies of nearly every decision or action memorandum
                    that concerned <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> during his
                    tenure as National Security Adviser and Secretary of State. The Geopolitical
                    Files and Subject Files were the most valuable sections, and the Saudi Arabia
                    files of particular importance.</p>
                <p>The Department of Defense was a key player during this period, and the records of
                    that Department, Record Group 330, Records of the Office of the Secretary of
                    Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense, are crucial and form a parallel
                    record for decisions on military sales, the joint commissions with Saudi Arabia,
                    the discussion of NSSMs, and the implementation of training programs, as well as
                    an important source for the Northrop and Lockheed defense commissions scandal.
                    This record group contains memoranda from Secretaries of Defense <persName

                                general subject files for Department of State materials. The
                                1969–1972 period includes two sets of materials (1967–1969 and
                                1970–1973) organized by a subject-numeric system. This system
                                consists of seven broad categories: Administration, Consular,
                                Culture and Information, Economic, Political and Defense, Science,
                                and Social. In particular, the Political (<gloss target="#t_POL_1"
                                    >POL</gloss>) and Defense (DEF) related files are important to
                                this <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume. Within each of
                                these divisions are subject subcategories. For example, Political
                                and Defense contains four subtopics: <gloss target="#t_POL_1"
                                    >POL</gloss> (Politics), DEF (Defense), CSM (Communism) and INT
                                (Intelligence). Numerical subdivisions further define the

                        <p>(S) <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 66, dated 12 July 1969,
                            directed a study be made of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy
                            toward the Persian Gulf. The study was required to address two specific
                            Defense issues: the future of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Navy’s Middle East Force (<gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss>), and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms
                            policy in the area. The initial draft of the study discussed but did not
                            give the pros and cons of these two issues. At <gloss target="#t_ISA_1"
                                >ISA</gloss> suggestion, pros and cons were added, though not as
                            fully as we desired. The final study, together with a paper describing
                            the principle elements of a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            presence in the Gulf and their budgetary implications, was forwarded to
                            the President on 30 July 1970.</p>
                        <p>(S) The President in <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 92 of 7
                            November 1970, approved a general strategy for the near term of
                            promoting cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Iran as the desirable
                            basis for maintaining stability in the Gulf, while recognizing the
                            preponderance of Iranian power and developing direct relations with
                            other Gulf states. The President approved expansion of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> diplomatic representation in the Lower
                            Gulf and directed that plans be developed for such representation. He
                            also directed that plans be developed for technical and educational
                            assistance and cultural exchange through private as well as public
                            programs. Plans were subsequently submitted on both subjects in late
                            1971. In the area of diplomatic representation, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has accredited our Ambassador resident
                            in Kuwait as non-resident Ambassador to Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab
                            Emirates, and Oman. A small mission has been opened in each of these
                            countries except Qatar, and one is expected to be opened there shortly.
                            We are responsive to requests from the lower Gulf states and Oman for
                            reimbursable technical assistance and have asked for authority to
                            provide “topping off” of salaries for <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                        <p>(<gloss target="#t_S_1">S</gloss>) In <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                                >NSDM</gloss> 92, the President decided in principle not to reduce
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> naval presence in the Persian
                            Gulf at this time. In a decision relating to the Indian Ocean, the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Senior Review Group a year
                            later approved a recommendation to improve the quality of <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> ships (a flagship
                            homeported at Bahrain and two destroyers rotated on temporary assignment
                            from the Atlantic Fleet). In August 1972, we replaced the flagship (a
                            26-year old converted seaplane tender) by a larger and more modern ship
                            (amphibious transport dock), and we have now begun to assign better
                            destroyers as occasion permits.</p>
                        <p>(C) The independence of Bahrain on 14 August 1971 and the British
                            military withdrawal in December meant that <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>, which had previously
                            been supported at the British base on Bahrain, would have to make direct
                            arrangements with the Government of Bahrain (<gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss>). On 23 December 1971, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> concluded
                            a <pb facs="0038" n="3" xml:id="pg_3"/> stationing agreement. This
                            agreement, which came under Senate scrutiny and some criticism last
                            year, contains no military or political commitment, either explicit or
                            implied, to the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> or any other state.
                            It merely provides for the continued use of support facilities formerly
                            made available by the British. A leasing agreement, fixing the first
                            year’s rent at $600,000, was concluded on 1 January 1972. As a result of
                            the assumption of shore facilities (10% of the former British base) and
                            the assignment of a larger flagship, <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> personnel homeported at Bahrain have had to be
                            increased from 261 to 527.</p>
                        <p>(U) The primary mission of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> is to demonstrate, by visiting friendly
                            countries in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and western Indian Ocean, the
                            continuing interest of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in those
                            countries and our desire to maintain good relations with them. By being
                            homeported in the Gulf, <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> gives special emphasis to our interest in that
                            strategically important area. <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss>, unlike the former British forces in the Gulf,
                            has no protective mission to perform; <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> officials have repeatedly said that we do not plan to
                            take over the former British role in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arms Policy</p>
                        <p>(S) The President on 17 January 1971 declared Kuwait eligible for arms
                            under the Foreign Military Sales Act. In April 1972, the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Under Secretaries Committee forwarded
                            a report to the President on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms
                            policy toward the lower Persian Gulf States and Oman. This study drew a
                            distinction between our arms supply policy toward Iran, Saudi Arabia and
                            Kuwait on the one hand, and the lower Gulf States and Oman on the other.
                            With respect to the former states, we look to them to bear the main
                            responsibility for peace and stability in the Gulf and to deter Iraq,
                            which borders them and is considered to be the main external threat. We
                            are, therefore, willing to help these states modernize and expand their
                            armed forces and are already deeply involved in major arms, advisory,
                            and training programs with Saudi Arabia and Iran. Kuwait, with our help,
                            is studying its defense requirements and may turn to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> for some of its arms. In the case of
                            the Lower Gulf States and Oman, we consider the main threat to be
                            internal and to come from Arab revolutionary elements hostile to <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests. The only likely external
                            threat to these states would come from Saudi Arabia or Iran, which might
                            intervene for limited territorial objectives or to restore order and
                            stability of the sort we might also desire.</p>
                        <p>(S) In <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 186 of 18 August 1972, the
                            President accepted the major recommendations of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> study. <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> arms policy will be based on the principles that
                            primary responsibility for stability in the Gulf falls upon the states
                            of the region, that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should
                            encourage cooperation among them for this purpose, that a continuing
                            British <pb facs="0039" n="4" xml:id="pg_4"/> role should be encouraged,
                            and that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should play an active
                            and imaginative direct role. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            will sell defense articles to the lower Gulf States and Oman that will
                            enhance their internal security. It will refuse articles that are
                            offensive or sophisticated in nature, that could undermine area
                            stability, or that could divert economic resources from pressing civil
                            needs. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will provide arms on a
                            sales basis and will avoid transactions that require the presence of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military personnel on other
                            than a temporary basis for advice or maintenance. Although the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> encourages the British to play a
                            continuing role in the Gulf, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            will respond sympathetically to reasonable requests for arms from the
                            lower Gulf States and Oman, which may prefer <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> to British equipment or may wish to diversify their
                            source of arms.</p>
                        <p>(C) On 2 January 1973, the President found the lower Gulf States and Oman
                            eligible under the Foreign Military Sales Act. To date, <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> arms sales to Kuwait and to the lower
                            Gulf States and Oman have been negligible. They are expected to remain
                            modest, especially when compared to those to Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Defense Activities</p>
                        <p>(U) We expect to provide some training in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> for Gulf military personnel. We have already trained
                            the Crown Prince of Bahrain at the Command and General Staff College,
                            Ft. Leavenworth. An increasing number of high-ranking <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss> civilian and military officials are
                            visiting the Gulf, especially Kuwait and Bahrain. Each year we join the

                        <p>(U) The <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>, with more experience than any
                            other outside power, continues to play an important role in the Gulf,
                            especially in financial and commercial matters. Although the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> retains no operational forces in the
                            Gulf for peacekeeping purposes, it continues to pursue an active
                            military diplomacy. It maintains an <gloss target="#t_RAF_1">RAF</gloss>
                            staging base Masirah off the southern coast of Oman, plans to conduct
                            periodic exercises with Gulf military forces, and makes flag showing
                            visits to the area. The <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> will endeavor
                            to maintain its arms market in the Gulf, its advisory role with Gulf
                            armed forces, and the training of Gulf military personnel in the <gloss

                        <p>(C) We welcome efforts by Jordan and Pakistan to play an active and
                            constructive role in the Gulf. Jordan and Pakistan can provide
                            much-needed skilled manpower and contribute to Gulf stability at a time
                            when the lower Gulf states and Oman are under pressure to lessen <pb

                        <p>(S) On the whole, political-military developments in the Gulf have gone
                            very well this past year. There are, however, some areas of concern to

                        <p>The Shah’s ambition to play a dominant role in the Gulf and the build-up
                            of his armed forces, with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> help, is
                            causing some uneasiness on the Arab side of the Gulf. Were Iran to act
                            against Arab interests, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could
                            find itself identified once again, as in the case of Israel, as an enemy

                            be miniscule. While there are no signs of internal opposition to the

                            growing numbers of educated armed services officers and civilian

                        <p>Iraq and Iran are major antagonists. The greatly superior military
                            strength of Iran is causing Iraq to turn increasingly to the <gloss

                            in greater Soviet influence in the Gulf, and could stimulate a regional
                            arms race, fueled by the two external superpowers. In its own quest for
                            greater influence in the Gulf, Iraq will continue to support dissident
                            groups that seek to overthrow traditionalist governments of the smaller
                            Gulf states, although these efforts have not had much success thus
                            far.</p>

                            between Jordanian and British officers in Oman and Abu Dhabi. There is
                            also some question of the extent to which Jordan, burdened by financial
                            difficulties and heavily dependent on foreign powers, including the

                            or should play a significantly greater role in Gulf affairs. If Jordan’s

                            is to get a Working Group started on three contingencies: (1) a plan for
                            an out<pb facs="0046" n="11" xml:id="pg_11"/>break of fighting in
                            Lebanon that might involve Syria—an approximation of what we should do
                            if a situation similar to that in Jordan in 1970 occurs. What might the
                            Israelis do? What would we want them to do? How would we react to a
                            Syrian invasion of Lebanon?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName>:</hi>
                            Would you include an Israeli invasion to push the Syrians out?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> That’s right.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EA_1">Eban</persName> told us that when the
                            Israelis last got together with the Lebanese in their Military Armistice
                            Commission contacts, the Lebanese said they assumed Israel would be
                            there if the Syrians should intervene.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> In 1970 Jordan wanted the Israelis to
                            come in at the right moment. Let’s focus on our diplomatic posture, our
                            military posture, and our attitude toward the Soviet Union and any moves
                            they might make in such a situation.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName>:</hi>
                            Including the evacuation of American citizens?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> I have assumed that was a State
                            Department responsibility.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName>:</hi>
                            This could put you ashore momentarily if you wanted.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> I don’t know whether we will want to go
                            ashore, but we had damned well better have the option and know how to do
                            it. I would like to know with some precision the various ways in which
                            we might become involved. For example: (1) if the Israelis go in and the
                            Soviets threaten; (2) if the Israelis go in and we want to get them out;
                            (3) if we want to keep the Israelis out while we evacuate American
                            citizens. We’re certainly not looking for an excuse to go into Lebanon;
                            we want to stay out. But in 1970 the planning we did in this room
                            enabled us to move with great speed if we had had to.</p>
                        <p>I also want to know the contingencies in which US intervention might be
                            contemplated. We shouldn’t focus initially on military movements, but on
                            [illegible] diplomatic moves and what military moves we might have to
                            make to back them up.</p>
                        <p>The second contingency relates to the kinds of things the Egyptians might
                            do, the various ways in which the Israelis might react and the
                            diplomatic issues that might ensue. Short of actual Soviet intervention,
                            it’s hard to envisage any direct US action. But we should consider what
                            to do to keep the Soviets out; the ways in which we might use the crisis
                            to get diplomatic movement, if that is what we want, or to return to the
                            status quo ante if it is decided that is desirable.</p>

                            They’re trying to follow the Vietnamese pattern. They need a little
                            fighting to attract attention. I think the reason Egypt played a major
                            role in mediating the situation in Lebanon was that they are afraid the
                            balloon might go up in Lebanon, Syria might invade, and Egypt might be
                            shown up as a paper tiger.</p>

                            so any reply will be disappointing; (2) on the other hand, they asked
                            for this last September and no reply at all will have a worse
                            effect.</p>

                            There are two kinds of pressure. The Israeli pressure is operating on a
                            worldwide scale to route them out wherever they are. But the more
                            important pressure is coming from the Lebanese Army and Government.
                            They’re not trying to kick the fedayeen out of Lebanon. That would buy
                            Syrian intervention. They’re just trying to make the situation more
                            manageable, by restricting them to light arms, concentrating them in

                            We’ve been playing it very softly with Libya in the hope that we can
                            hang on to the oil property until September 1 when the federation with
                            Egypt is supposed to take place. This might bring a change of direction.
                            In the new situation it might be possible to protect our interests
                            better. Of course, it could be worse if the Egyptians want to push us
                            around. The issue should be discussed. In the first place, the Libyans
                            don’t have the people to run things. The Assistant Secretary for Africa
                            should be here for a discussion of Libya.</p>

                            F–4s to Saudi Arabia they will show up in the central conflict sooner or
                            later. This will just stimulate demands on the Israeli side. If every
                            country comes in with a list of demands we just try to keep them happy.
                            We need a strategy over the next three to five years. I agree that Saudi
                            Arabia will keep the pressure on us because of the overall Middle East

                            We have a paper on the Saudi thing that we have been discussing with
                            Defense which takes the Israelis into account. In the next ten days, the
                            French may well get in and sell aircraft to the Saudis. We would lose
                            the kudos and the balance of payments advantage as well as the possible
                            help in the oil situation. I stand by our recommendation to sell them
                            F–4s. It’s possible they will end in the combat zone. But we’re only
                            talking about one squadron for the Kuwaitis and two squadrons for Saudi
                            Arabia—36 planes—with delivery between 1975 and 1980. If we get in
                            rather than the French, we can control their training and education and
                            can impose a third-party caveat. We can’t guarantee that they won’t end
                            up in a battle against Israel, but our ability to control them would
                            certainly be better than the French.</p>

                            There’s a good case to be made that the Israeli military might be better

                            Because US involvement means implicit control. US technicians would act

                            build on there is Saudi Arabia. It’s the only country able to provide

                            relations may be superficial, but the Saudis are deeply concerned about

                        <p>Much of the old political framework in the Persian Gulf area, site of
                            two-thirds of the world’s oil reserves, has gone, opening the way for
                            new patterns of development.</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—The end of British political and military responsibility for the
                                smaller states, whose leaders and institutions will be hard pressed
                                to cope with demands for change, leaves them vulnerable to external
                                subversion, internal discord, and the vicissitudes of regional
                                politics.</p>
                            <p>—The Soviet Union, having established an important political
                                influence in the Arab world and a significant military presence in
                                the Mediterranean area, shows a growing interest in the Indian Ocean
                                and the Gulf—on its own and as patron of the radical regimes in Iraq
                                and South Yemen.</p>
                            <p>—The increasing importance of Gulf oil, coupled with Arab frustration
                                over the impasse with Israel, raises the specter of oil being used
                                    <pb facs="0053" n="18" xml:id="pg_18"/> for political
                                purposes—something occasionally threatened but not attempted on a

                        <p>The relationship of Saudi Arabia and Iran is of key importance to the
                            Western position in the Gulf. Relations between the two are good, but
                            not likely to become close. Both seek to resist the spread of
                            revolutionary forces. The Shah, with a large and growing oil income to
                            pay for an expanding military establishment, has embarked on an
                            activist, forward policy in the Gulf—reflecting Iranian apprehensions
                            about radical Arab power and the Shah’s ambitions in the Gulf. This
                            bothers Saudi Arabia, which aspires to a position of leadership among
                            the smaller Arab states of the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Given the fragility of the smaller states, the crosscurrents of rivalry
                            between the regional powers, and external support for radical
                            subversion, important change appears inevitable.</p>
                        <p>Certain developments would be of little consequence either for oil or
                            political relations in the area, e.g., the replacement of one ruler in a
                            smaller state by another. Even a radical regime replacing an incumbent
                            conservative in one or another of the lesser states would not <hi
                                rend="italic">necessarily</hi> interfere with oil, though dealing
                            with radical regimes on access to oil is marked by special difficulties
                            and political complications.</p>
                        <p>Other developments could endanger US interests.</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—Turmoil in one of the lesser states could lead to Iranian
                                intervention, which in turn would set the Arabs, including Saudi
                                Arabia, against Iran. This could badly erode US relations with both
                                Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p>
                            <p>—The unlikely contingency of an upheaval led by revolutionary forces
                                in the larger oil-producing states would be difficult or impossible
                                to reverse and would threaten the US position in the Gulf as a
                                whole.</p>
                            <p>—A recrudescence of Arab-Israeli hostilities would be likely to lead
                                some Gulf states to embargo oil shipments to the US for a time and
                                perhaps to nationalize or otherwise hit at American firms. It would
                                not be as easy for the US to ride out this kind of storm as in the

                        <p>1. The already great importance of the Persian Gulf region as a source of
                            oil for the industrial world is certain to grow. Gulf states control
                            nearly two-thirds of the world’s proved oil reserves and currently
                            produce about one-third of the oil consumed in the non-communist world.

                            traditional monarchical regimes. Only Iraq has succumbed (15 years ago)
                            to revolution. After several violent changes of regime, Iraq is now
                            ruled by the socialist Baath Party.<note n="3" type="source"

                            Palestinians—have brought in social and political ideas at odds with
                            traditional attitudes. Generally speaking, the leadership and

                            vigorously represses dissent. The Amir of Kuwait has established a
                            parliament and permits a relatively free press. King <persName

                            the oil boom has provided such extensive social services and
                            opportunities for personal gain that few have thus far been inclined to
                            risk dangerous or radical means of expressing dissatisfaction. But in
                            time, discontent seems likely to grow, especially where regimes do not
                            satisfy the demands of the increasingly educated and politically aware

                            the Sultan’s forces in the hinterland for 10 years. The leaders of the

                                <gloss target="#t_PFLOAG_1">PFLOAG</gloss> dissidents in Bahrain and
                            elsewhere along the Gulf in hopes of facilitating the establishment of

                        <p>6. Most Palestinian fedayeen groups have representatives in the Gulf
                            states. Although they are there primarily to raise money, the
                            sheikhdoms, as a sign of support for the Arab cause, accord the fedayeen
                            a degree of freedom which has increased the latter’s influence. The
                            fedayeen have some potential for terrorist activity against Western
                            interests, including American oil installations, and also against
                            conservative regimes. In the event of an outbreak of major Arab-Israeli
                            hostilities, their presence would increase pressure on the Gulf states
                            to act against US interests.</p>

                            states at the end of 1971, but it has not disengaged entirely. British
                            seconded and contract officers remain the backbone of the security

                                >RAF</gloss> station on the island of Masirah. In 1972, sales of

                            services to the Gulf states amounted to $820 million, while the US sold
                            them $1.1 billion worth of goods. Together this comprised over a third
                            of the imports of the Gulf regimes. British companies retain a large
                            share of oil production in the Gulf and US oil companies produce and
                            market somewhat over half of production from this region. The US and
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> are the principal sources of arms
                            for the Gulf states (except for Iraq, which relies on the <gloss

                            consume sizable quantities of Gulf oil and are expanding commercial
                            activity to pay for it. None of these countries plays an important
                            political or security role in the Gulf, but government level contacts
                            with oil producers are growing. France, however, is becoming
                            increasingly active in efforts to sell arms in the Gulf.</p>

                        <p>8. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in recent years has shown a
                            growing interest in Gulf affairs. Soviet moves have been probing and
                            exploratory. Despite their efforts, diplomatic relations have yet to be
                            established with some states. Moscow sees the Gulf as part of its
                            overall policy in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean areas, and
                            seeks to expand its influence there. Not only do the Soviets wish to
                            buttress their relations with radical Arab states, but they want access
                            to shore facilities to extend the deployment duration of their naval
                                forces.<note n="6" type="source" xml:id="d5fn6">The Director of

                                believe that the ability to influence, control, deny, or disrupt
                                Western and Japanese access to energy resources of the Persian
                                Gulf—especially in time of crisis—or for diplomatic-economic
                                leverage—is fundamental to Soviet long-term strategic goals in that
                                part of the world. The Soviet Union will likely continue to exploit
                                every feasible, low-risk opportunity to attain the above goals.
                                While it is doubtful that an accurate assessment of Soviet
                                techniques of subversion, bribery, and clandestine support to
                                radical elements can be projected, there can be little doubt that
                                such means will continue to be employed in concert with rapid
                                delivery of arms and profferings of limited economic assistance.
                                While Soviet success to date has been limited, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has nevertheless contributed
                                much to the region’s growing instability, to uncertainty about
                                futures, and to conditions which make for miscalculation. It is
                                believed that the current estimate understates the increasing threat
                                to Western interests represented by Soviet efforts in the Persian

                            Western dependence on Gulf oil resources and the growing importance of
                            the Gulf to the US further attract Soviet attention to the region. If
                            one or more area state on its own should undertake to limit or stop
                            production, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would be in a

                                >USSR</gloss> will not, for many years to come, have the financial

                        <p>9. In seeking to establish themselves in the Gulf, the Soviets frequently
                            find their interests and objectives in conflict. The objectives of good
                            relations with Iran, continuing military support to Iraq, and
                            establishing a presence in the lesser Gulf states are pursued, although
                            they are not always compatible. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> gives political support to national liberation
                            movements both directly and through Iraq and <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss>. The Soviet position is also complicated by divisions
                            and antagonisms among Arab revolutionary groups who seek Moscow’s aid,
                            by lack of control over such groups, and by rivalry with the People’s
                            Republic of China. The Soviets are providing weapons, and the Chinese
                            provide arms and training directly to the rebel movement in Oman.</p>
                        <p>10. Beyond this, the national interests of the Persian Gulf states impose
                            limits on what the Soviet Union is likely to seek or to be able <pb
                                facs="0057" n="22" xml:id="pg_22"/> to accomplish in coming years.
                            The Soviets are unlikely to gain much influence in Saudi Arabia, Iran,
                            or the lesser Gulf states, at least so long as the present anticommunist
                            regimes remain in power. For the moment, Moscow’s progress in
                            establishing diplomatic relations with the smaller states is blocked by
                            the latter’s deference to Saudi and Iranian objections. Moscow is likely
                            to make slow headway at best in increasing its influence in Iraq. It
                            will probably get rights to greater usage of port facilities at Umm
                            Qasr, which it now uses intermittently. The Soviets have now established
                            an almost continuous naval presence on the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of
                            Aden, and they could attempt to do the same in the Gulf. On balance,
                            despite limitations and possible temporary setbacks, the overall Soviet
                            position in the Gulf area can be expected gradually to improve.</p>
                        <p>11. Knowing how critical the resources of the area are to the West and
                            Japan, the Soviets would no doubt like one day to be in a position to be
                            able to control or deny the flow of these resources. Were they able to
                            do this, the balance of power in the world would be drastically changed
                            in their favor. But they are a long way from achieving such a position,
                            and the self-interest of the states in the region will remain a
                            considerable obstacle. Moreover, the Soviets know that an attempt to
                            affront the vital interests of all the advanced industrial states in
                            this manner would entail the highest risks.</p>

                        <p>12. Some of the larger and richer states in the Middle East and South
                            Asia view the Gulf as an arena in which to exercise their nationalist
                            ambitions. Egypt, which once had pretensions to leadership in the Gulf,
                            is no longer particularly active there. President Qadhafi of Libya
                            aspires to take part in the defense of Arab interests against Iran.
                            Qadhafi used British acquiescence in the Shah’s 1971 occupation of three
                            small islands in the lower Gulf as the occasion for nationalizing the
                            British Petroleum Company in Libya. He strongly supports the fedayeen
                            and encourages them to act against US interests in the Gulf. At the same
                            time, his strong anticommunist convictions led him to promise Sultan
                            Qabus of Oman $30 million in military aid to assist in the fight against
                            the <gloss target="#t_PFLOAG_1">PFLOAG</gloss> guerrillas.</p>
                        <p>13. Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Yemen (Sana), and Sudan have all sought and
                            received financial aid from the smaller Gulf states. Jordan, which is
                            also seeking political allies, is providing military supplies and
                            technicians, security advisors, and some technical assistance to
                            economic projects. Less directly concerned with money, but worried by
                            the potential for turbulence in the area, the Pakistani regime is
                            providing similar services to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and, on a smaller
                            scale, to various Gulf states. India is concerned about oil supplies and

                            especially Iraq. India has recently signed a 12-year oil agreement with
                            Iraq and is supplying advisors and training to the Iraqi Air Force.
                            However, this association has created strains on India’s relations with
                            Iran due to Iranian hostility to Iraq and its closeness with

                            British forces rather better than was generally expected. Iran has drawn
                            Arab criticism of its self-declared mission as guardian power, but it
                            got away with the occupation of three islands near the Strait of Hormuz
                            with little more than verbal abuse. Bahrain held its first general
                            election in an orderly fashion. The <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>
                            has hung together. But there remain many problems and uncertainties in
                            the Gulf situation, and disquieting and potentially destabilizing events
                            continue to occur. The rebellion in Dhofar Province of Oman persists; an
                            extensive network of antiregime elements has been turned up in Bahrain;
                            Iraq attacked a Kuwaiti border post to reinforce a territorial claim.
                            Over the next four or five years, the key questions in the Gulf system
                            are the durability and adaptiveness of the several regimes and whether
                            conflict and difference among the larger ones upsets—or only

                            ruler, has coopted or suppressed internal political opposition. Even if
                            succession arrangements do not prove lasting, a coalition of forces
                            based on the military and the Shah’s loyal subordinates is a good bet to
                            run Iran for some time after he leaves the scene. There almost certainly
                            will be changes in the distribution of power. But the chances of a
                            radically different successor taking over are not great, given the
                            wariness of the Shah and the effectiveness of his security service,
                                <gloss target="#t_SAVAK_1">SAVAK</gloss>. Although nationalist
                            feeling is on the rise, the dependence of any successor government on
                            oil revenue, which has become central to Iranian hopes for development,
                            would temper the desire to act rashly. If a more violently nationalist
                            regime took charge, it might justify its takeover by loosening presently
                            close political ties to the West. But its view of Iran’s national
                            interest and role in the region would probably not differ much from the
                            Shah’s.</p>
                        <p>16. The <hi rend="italic">Saudi Arabian</hi> regime is more conservative
                            and less efficient than that of the Shah. Moreover, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> is almost 70 and has some
                            health problems. Arrangements for succession in the event of his death
                            have been made and are likely to be carried out, although factional
                            conflict within the royal family remains a possibility. If he should <pb
                                facs="0059" n="24" xml:id="pg_24"/> undergo an extended decline in
                            health and mental capacity, there would be increasing prospect for
                            intrafamily dispute over a successor. The large Saudi royal family has a
                            number of capable individuals and probably would unite against outside
                            threats. Princes serve in the army, and the national guard is closely
                            controlled by the royal family. For the next several years, therefore,
                            the chances seem reasonably good that the Saudi monarchy will
                            survive.</p>
                        <p>17. The Baathi regime in <hi rend="italic">Iraq</hi> has a firm grip on
                            the reins of government. It faces continued opposition from the Kurds
                            who have maintained effective autonomy for more than 10 years in the
                            north, although they cannot operate successfully outside their mountain
                            fastness. Other dissidents have been ruthlessly suppressed. While
                            military factions have the power to overthrow the present ruling group,
                            the main facets of Iraqi foreign policy would probably be basically
                            unchanged under new leadership. Any Iraqi regime would persist in
                            antipathy to Iran, maintain designs on Kuwaiti territory, and attempt to
                            influence Gulf affairs. Infighting, however, might distract the Iraqi
                            Government from disruptive activity in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>18. The durability of the regimes in the smaller states is less assured.
                                <hi rend="italic">Kuwait</hi> has managed to avoid revolutionary
                            dissidence by a generous system of social welfare, high wages, and
                            deportation of anyone who attempts to agitate against the regime. The
                            loyalty of the immigrant population (about half the total) is suspect to
                            many Kuwaitis, who solidly support the government policy of not granting
                            citizenship or political status to immigrants, even to Arabs. Although
                            there are some 200,000 Palestinian residents, most are there for the
                            money and are politically passive; nonetheless, there is a small but
                            growing number of fedayeen who present a potential hazard. Kuwaiti
                            attempts to increase its security by buying friends abroad through loans
                            and development have not secured the strong backing it sought among Arab
                            states against such ever-present dangers as Iraqi territorial demands.
                            The Kuwaitis keep tight control of all military and security services.
                            They will have internal security problems, but dissidents are unlikely
                            to find the means to overthrow the government.</p>
                        <p>19. <hi rend="italic">Oman</hi> is the sole state in the area
                            experiencing active rebellion. The war stretches the regime’s financial
                            and manpower resources, taking more than half the budget. Thanks to
                            continuing British assistance and aid from Saudi Arabia, Jordan,
                            Pakistan, and Iran (which has sent a military contingent to Oman),
                            Sultan Qabus has been able to contain the rebellion in Dhofar Province,
                            far from the capital and from the oil producing areas of the Gulf. The
                            promised Libyan aid, if it materializes, will also help. Yet the recent
                            series of arrests in northern Oman indicate that a subversive threat
                            persists there as well, and it will be difficult in any case to
                            eliminate small guerrilla bands from <pb facs="0060" n="25"
                                xml:id="pg_25"/> Dhofar’s rugged terrain. The war is likely to
                            continue as long as the rebels find safehaven in neighboring South
                            Yemen. In this situation, the prognosis for the Oman regime remains
                            uncertain.</p>
                        <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Bahrain</hi> is also potentially unstable, but at
                            the same time its more educated, sophisticated population has perhaps
                            the best chance of the smaller Gulf states of developing political and
                            economic institutions that can meet its needs. Oil production is slowly
                            declining and jobs and money are growing tighter. The population is also
                            divided between Sunni and Shia Muslims, many of the latter of Iranian
                            origin. The presence of British officers in charge of its security
                            service is important to the regime’s chances of survival.</p>
                        <p>21. The other sheikhdoms are challenged more by traditional tribal
                            factionalism than by dissidents seeking to change the orientation of the
                            regimes. The <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> remains a collection
                            of small, traditional communities largely lacking central governmental
                            institutions. With a total population of 225,000 and area roughly the
                            size of West Virginia, there are still two ministries of defense, five
                            armies, eight police forces, one navy, one helicopter force, and one air
                            force. While the states of the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> are
                            slowly learning to work together, it will be a long time—if ever—before
                            they speak with one voice.</p>
                        <p>22. Replacement of any one of the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>’s
                            rulers by a tribal or dynastic rival would probably have little effect
                            upon either the larger alignment in the Gulf or upon US interests. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> could probably cope with a
                            small band of revolutionaries if it has some warning. Nonetheless, these
                            regimes are fragile and could be overthrown suddenly by relatively small
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>23. While the chances that the smaller Gulf regimes will survive appear
                            fair, there are always unforeseeable events—the accidental death or
                            assassination of a key figure, the carefully hidden coup plot—which
                            could bring a revolutionary regime to power in one state or another.
                            Even if such a government were short-lived it would have great potential
                            for making trouble among the Gulf states.</p>

                        <p>24. Enmity between Iraq and the principal monarchies—Iran and Saudi
                            Arabia—is not likely to moderate as long as the Baath regime in Baghdad
                            survives. Each side frames its policies in response to the success or
                            failure of the other in expanding influence in the area. Iraq continues
                            to receive Soviet arms, but Iran is the stronger power, and, with its
                            program of purchasing the most modern weapons, primarily from the US, is
                            almost certain to remain so for many years to come. Despite their arms
                            buildups, both sides are reluctant to engage in all-out hostilities. The
                            Shah would respond to Iraqi thrusts if he saw them as a major threat to
                            Iran. Otherwise he would be inhibited from <pb facs="0061" n="26"
                                xml:id="pg_26"/> responding forcefully, as in the case of the recent
                            Kuwaiti border incursion, by fears for Iran’s oil installations and by
                            concern at arousing a strong negative reaction among Arabs generally.
                            And the Iraqis would probably draw back if they felt they were provoking
                            a major confrontation with the Shah.</p>
                        <p>25. Although they have a common interest in opposing the spread of
                            revolutionary forces in the region, Saudi Arabia and Iran are uneasy
                            associates. The Shah is using Iran’s rising oil revenues to expand
                            Iranian military power and will continue to exploit American (and
                            Western Europe’s) need for oil to assure support for Iran’s ambitions.
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> is disturbed by
                            the Shah’s pretensions to dominate the Gulf and also by Iran’s ties to
                            Israel. <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> looks to the US
                            to discourage the Shah from actions that would embarrass Saudi Arabia in
                            the Arab world or challenge its leadership. The Saudis believe that they
                            should be not only the pacesetters for oil matters, but spokesman for
                            the Arab interest and the country to which the smaller Arab states of
                            the region look for guidance.</p>
                        <p>26. Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia appear good on the surface,
                            but are not likely to become close. While <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> and the Shah both seek to cooperate in
                            maintaining stability in the Gulf, their capacity for cooperation is
                            limited. The pervasive suspicions raised by the deep incompatibilities
                            of Iranian and Arab nationalism will not be easily overcome and neither
                            ruler has confidence in the long-term stability of the other’s regime.
                            And the Saudis’ effectiveness in dealing with Iranians is not high; they
                            resent being pushed toward action by the latter. The Shah and <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> generally act independently
                            in opposing radical threats, e.g., in providing assistance to Sultan
                            Qabus of Oman. Some improvements in consultation between the two
                            governments may nevertheless be effected.</p>
                        <p>27. In this atmosphere the ouster—or threat of imminent ouster—of a ruler
                            in a smaller Gulf state by revolutionary forces would strain the present
                            tentative cooperation between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran has the
                            military force and command structure to intervene rapidly. The Shah is
                            not spoiling for a fight, but would probably react quickly if he judged
                            that only urgent action could foil revolutionaries. Such action would
                            raise serious problems for <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName>, who tends to respond more cautiously to external
                            events. Saudi Arabia, whose military forces would require longer
                            reaction time than Iran’s, would prefer that only Arab troops be used on
                            the western side of the Gulf. Hence, the prospect of Saudi-Iranian
                            misunderstanding or even confrontation would be high if Iran should
                            unilaterally send troops to an Arab state. Indeed, all Arab states of
                            the region would be concerned in face of a serious confrontation;
                            pressures of Arab nationalism might compel even Gulf states directly
                            threatened by the prospect of another revolutionary regime in the area
                            to oppose Iran.</p>
                        <pb facs="0062" n="27" xml:id="pg_27"/>
                        <p>28. Relations between Saudi Arabia and the smaller Arab states of the
                            Gulf also are uneasy, largely because of Saudi Arabia’s paternalist
                            approach and certain unsettled territorial claims. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> will probably not renounce
                            his demands to Abu Dhabi territory, though he is unlikely to press them
                            vigorously. Similarly, while Saudi Arabia’s dispute with Oman is now in
                            abeyance, it has, at least until recently, been a constraint against
                            closer Saudi-Omani relations. At the same time, other small states will
                            seek to enlist Saudi support in their own petty dynastic rivalries; such
                            involvement will make an effective Saudi role in the Gulf more
                            difficult.</p>

                        <p>29. The present situation in the Gulf is relatively favorable to the US.
                            The traditional regimes there provide oil, mostly through US and other
                            Western companies, offer rapidly expanding markets, and provide
                            important communications and transit facilities. There will continue to
                            be mutual interest between the producers of oil, who want to sell it,
                            and consumers, who want to buy it. Likewise, the states of the Gulf want
                            the military and commercial goods that the industrialized oil consumers
                            produce. The outlook in the near term is not for political upheaval, but
                            there are uncertainties in the situation and over time these could
                            evolve in several different ways.</p>

                            major US interests. For example, one dynastic rival might replace
                            another in one of the smaller states without changing its political
                            complexion. The <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> might even split in
                            two or more parts. The Amir of Bahrain might delegate more authority to
                            elected institutions. But the sum and substance of such changes would
                            not cause wide reverberations in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>31. A second possible line of development would be the overthrow of one
                            of the smaller states by revolutionary forces. This would not <hi
                                rend="italic">necessarily</hi> have serious consequences for the US,
                            though dealing with radical regimes on access to oil is marked by
                            special difficulties and political complications. But as long as
                            neighboring states could agree either to intervene to expel the
                            revolutionary regime or to tolerate it, the ouster of the government in
                            one of the minor sheikhdoms would have little significance.</p>
                        <p>32. A more serious challenge to US interests would arise from the
                            confrontation of Iran and Saudi Arabia over ways to handle a
                            revolution—or the threat of revolution—in the smaller monarchies of <pb
                                facs="0063" n="28" xml:id="pg_28"/> the Gulf. Iran enjoys such a
                            commanding military advantage over Saudi Arabia that King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> would be unlikely to initiate
                            military action to assert his position. But each party would press the
                            US to support its stand. The US probably has considerable power to
                            restrain both contenders, though it might have little ability to restore
                            the <hi rend="italic">status quo.</hi> But this would be a painful
                            process and could badly erode US relations with both Saudi Arabia and
                            Iran.</p>
                        <p>33. The unlikely contingency of an upheaval which brought revolutionary
                            forces to power in Iran or Saudi Arabia would have serious consequences
                            for the US position in the Gulf as a whole. It probably could not be
                            reversed and would inevitably entail a major shift in power away from
                            conservative forces.</p>
                        <p>34. A serious setback to the US position in the Gulf could also come from
                            a major intensification of the crisis in Arab-Israeli affairs and
                            particularly if another Arab military defeat ensued. Except for the
                            Shah, who maintains friendly relations with Israel, the other Gulf
                            states, including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, would all feel compelled to
                            take actions against the US, which they regard as Tel Aviv’s principal
                            ally. In this situation some Gulf states would likely embargo oil
                            shipments to the US for a time and perhaps would nationalize or
                            otherwise hit at American firms. (US requirements for Persian Gulf oil
                            are growing and the Arabs know it.) It would not be as easy for the US
                            to ride out this storm as it was in the past.</p>
                        <p>35. In any event, the US will be far more intimately involved in Gulf
                            affairs than in the past. Given the fragility of the smaller states, the
                            crosscurrents of rivalry among the regional powers, growing Western
                            dependence on Gulf oil, and external support for radical subversion,
                            important change appears inevitable.</p>

                                of Probable Lines of Soviet Strategy and Policy in the Eastern
                                Mediterranean, Near East, Arabian Peninsula, and South Asia”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The paper for discussion at this meeting is the one you asked for to
                            focus on the issue of Soviet intentions and efforts in the arc extending
                            from the eastern Mediterranean through South Asia. In the development of
                            the paper, it became clear that the tendency in the bureaucracy is to
                            dismiss the notion that there is a new and persistent Soviet thrust into
                            this area.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The purpose of this meeting</hi>, therefore, is to
                            accomplish <hi rend="italic">two objectives:</hi></p>
                        <p>1. To <hi rend="italic">examine the thesis</hi> that there is a Soviet
                            effort in this area by assessing the degree of Soviet activity there and
                            discussing possible responses to it. In the next several weeks—with the
                            visits of <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Bhutto</persName> and the Shah,
                            your trip to Peking and a possible mission to Saudi Arabia—we shall hear
                            a great deal about this thesis. A simple objective of the meeting is to
                            put those who will be participating in those events in a position to
                            respond with a sensible position of our own.</p>
                        <p>2. The other objective is <hi rend="italic">to begin to articulate a US
                                strategy for this area.</hi> At present, much of our policy is a
                            collection of responses in the context of bilateral relationships. While

                                >choices</hi> are not mutually exclusive but are rather a matter of
                            emphasis. The general elements of a strategy include these possible
                            approaches:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>1. We can continue to pursue <hi rend="italic">bilateral
                                    relationships</hi> throughout this area in a routine way. If we
                                operated primarily on the basis of the judgments in the paper
                                prepared for this meeting, this would probably be the result.</p>
                            <p>2. We could concentrate not just on strengthening our bilateral
                                relationships but on (a) <hi rend="italic">giving new emphasis to
                                    our programs</hi> in this area in order to create an impression
                                of a reinvigorated American position and (b) <hi rend="italic"
                                    >actively promoting the relationships evolving among countries
                                    friendly to us in the area.</hi> There is a trend toward a set
                                of inter-relationships there which can serve our interests. There is
                                an evolving back-channel relationship between the Shah and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> and between the Shah and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>. Complementing
                                this is a very close relationship between <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> and his chief of
                                intelligence and <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> is working
                                increasingly closely with the Saudis and in Oman and the Persian
                                Gulf, where the Shah is also heavily involved. In an unusual way,
                                the Israelis are tied into this network through their relationship
                                with the Shah and their unique position vís-a-vís Jordan. Lebanon
                                and Turkey also have their relationships with some of these
                                countries. Pakistan developed an even closer tie with Iran and has
                                military assistance relationships with Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and
                                Jordan. Ethiopia has its tie with Israel and may become more
                                involved with affairs of the Arabian Peninsula. A US strategy which
                                consciously promotes these relationships and works with them would
                                provide a broader dimension to our policy. It would also leave the
                                US sufficient flexibility not only to develop a close relationship
                                with these friends but also to compete for position in countries
                                somewhat less friendly like India and Egypt. In contrast to the
                                policy of <hi rend="italic">containment</hi>, this would be a policy
                                of <hi rend="italic">diffusion</hi>—nurturing enough local
                                resistance so that Soviet thrusts are absorbed without damage.</p>
                            <p>3. A third possible strategy, often recommended by Israeli leaders
                                and the Shah, is <hi rend="italic">to concentrate principally on the
                                    points of strength within <pb facs="0069" n="34" xml:id="pg_34"
                                    /> this area.</hi> The points most commonly mentioned are Iran,
                                Israel and Ethiopia. One could also add Saudi Arabia because of its
                                potential economic power and perhaps even Pakistan, though less for
                                its own power than for the importance of its stability for Iran and
                                the subcontinent. This strategy differs from the second mainly in
                                degree. The more the US depends openly on these points of power and
                                cooperation, less on regional, the more we risk alienating other
                                nations in the area, especially in the Arab world, but also India.
                                The alienation of India and Egypt is obvious if we were to
                                concentrate on Pakistan and Israel. It is less obvious, but
                                possible, that we would alienate Saudi Arabia by focusing on Israel
                                and Iran.</p>
                            <p>4. A complement to any of the above would be <hi rend="italic">to
                                    seek US-Soviet understandings on issues in the region</hi>,
                                drawing on our global relationship to limit the potentially
                                dangerous aspects of rivalry there. <hi rend="italic">What you want
                                    from the meeting</hi> is to lay a foundation for acceptance of
                                an approach between the second and third possible strategies
                                outlined above. One objective is awareness that a regional strategy
                                would enhance US interests and at the same time meet the concerns of
                                our friends in the area.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">In conducting the meeting</hi>, we recommend that
                                you:</p>

                            <p>—then lead discussion through a series of questions toward some
                                judgments on whether or not a concept for US policy is possible that
                                would cover this whole region. A progression of such questions is in

                        <p>The problem you will face in this discussion will be that most of the
                            people around the table will be tempted immediately to slide into
                            consideration of problems in one sub-region or another, for example the
                            Arab-Israeli conflict or Persian Gulf issues. Constant effort will have
                            to be made to keep the focus on the plane of higher strategy. One way of
                            doing this would be to say that separate discussion of the Arabian
                            Peninsula and Persian Gulf problem is scheduled a little later when the

                            <p>What is lacking in this paper is a convincing portrayal of the region
                                from the eastern Mediterranean through South Asia as it must appear
                                to Soviet leaders as they consider their global strategy. Similarly,
                                there is little portrayal of the network of inter-relationships
                                among friends of the US that tends to draw together diverse nations
                                across this broad area and thereby limits Soviet influence. Nowhere
                                does one find a description, for instance, of how Soviet designs in
                                this area relate to the US breakthrough with China or of the
                                strategic importance that may be attached to this area by the Soviet
                                military. For example, the Sixth Fleet, Polaris and Poseidon, with
                                their associated nuclear capability, are absent from the study.</p>
                            <p>Instead the emphasis is on Soviet efforts to extend influence, to

                            <p>These interests suggest that the Soviets are satisfied with a no-war,
                                no peace situation in the Middle East, and will consequently not
                                help (or hinder) US peacemaking efforts; influence will be extended
                                by exploiting regional disputes; and in order to offset recent
                                setbacks in Egypt, the Soviets will try to build up their presence
                                in Syria, Iraq and South Yemen.</p>

                            <p>Israel, Iran and India will remain the primary power centers, with
                                Saudi Arabia progressively playing an important economic role
                                because of oil and increasing financial reserves. Nationalism will
                                remain a basic force constraining the efforts of outside powers to
                                influence events in the region. In the Middle East, the Arab-Israeli
                                dispute and oil will be the two major factors shaping events, and
                                increasingly they will be linked. In South Asia, the Soviets want
                                peace and stability, not the dismemberment of Pakistan or a renewal
                                of conflict. [<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Egypt’s continuing

                                policy on the assumption that Egypt is the key to relations with the

                            <p>In the region as a whole, the prospects for US-Soviet cooperation are
                                not good, except in limiting the consequences of another
                                Arab-Israeli war. <hi rend="italic">The Soviets have no grand design

                                    seek to extend their influence through aggressive competition

                            <p>The study does not suggest any broad approach to the area as a whole,
                                but rather deals with three sub regions, suggesting that they are
                                better dealt with separately because the priorities and problems are
                                so different.</p>
                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">In the Middle East</hi>, an Arab-Israeli
                                settlement is of highest priority. The study avoids considering this
                                issue directly, but does suggest some bilateral measures that might
                                improve US-Egyptian relations (e.g., helping to finance the SUMED
                                pipeline).</p>
                            <p>—In the <hi rend="italic">Persian Gulf</hi>, the choice lies between
                                continuation of our low-profile policy of encouraging Iran and Saudi
                                Arabia to take the lead in insuring the security of the area, or of
                                playing a more prominent role, especially in areas of conflict such
                                as Oman and Yemen.</p>
                            <p>—Finally, in <hi rend="italic">South Asia</hi> the options are
                                described as actively countering Soviet influence, trying to
                                cooperate with the Soviets, or standing back from the politics of
                                the region.</p>
                            <p>Each of these broad choices implies a number of specific actions in
                                the political, economic and military spheres. As the paper is now
                                drafted, however, these options are not closely tied to the Soviet
                                dimension of our concern with this region. In the next section, a
                                more general approach to dealing with the Soviets will be
                                discussed.</p>

                                negotiations, the study discusses the following steps that the US

                            <p>Some of the principal questions raised by Soviet policies in this
                                region are not adequately covered in the paper or are not focused
                                sufficiently. Of particular importance are the following:</p>

                                    coherence to this activity? Or, as the State paper says, is it
                                    accurate to conclude that “the pattern of their actions does not
                                    suggest the existence of some kind of grand design for the area

                                discussed in depth—is where this area stands on the scale of Soviet
                                global priorities. Where does it fit in the interplay of Soviet

                                relations? Are the Soviets likely to encourage accommodations among
                                their friends in the region in order to avoid having to choose sides
                                in various conflicts? Will they promote subversion in the weak

                                political support be most relevant in offsetting Soviet efforts in

                                    thinking, what is our view of the Shah’s analysis</hi>? Iranian
                                officials are concerned with the danger of growing Soviet influence
                                in the Persian Gulf. The Shah apparently feels that the best way to
                                keep the Gulf stable and secure is for both superpowers to keep
                                their military forces out of the area. Consequently, the Shah would
                                like the US to remove <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                    >MIDEASTFOR</gloss>, the small US naval unit stationed at
                                Bahrain. In his view, our presence there insures that the Soviets
                                will eventually establish comparable forces operating out of Umm
                                Qasr. Since the Shah is likely to raise this issue during his visit,
                                it should be discussed at a high level in order to develop a
                                consistent US position. It is important for us to reach a judgment
                                on whether the Shah’s approach would help to enhance the stability
                                of the Gulf or whether it would lead to Iranian dominance and
                                intervention on the Arab side of the Gulf, with attendant dangers
                                for US interests in Saudi Arabia.</p>

                                    Perception of a Soviet Threat: In the light of our own thinking,

                                        >Bhutto</persName>’s analysis</hi>? The Pakistani government
                                holds that the Soviets, perhaps in collusion with the Indians, have
                                sought in recent years to weaken Pakistan by encouraging and aiding
                                separatist groups in Pakistan’s western frontier provinces. We have
                                no good evidence of our own that would confirm this. The
                                intelligence estimate is that the Soviets believe their own best
                                interests would not be served by the dismemberment of Pakistan or by
                                the renewal of conflict and instability in Pakistan or elsewhere on
                                the subcontinent. What needs to be analyzed more closely is just
                                what kind of situation—peace and stability, controlled or limited
                                tension, or instability—the Soviets view as serving their best
                                interests on the subcontinent. In this context, it may be worth
                                considering what the Soviets have in mind when they press for an

                                Most of our friends in this region—Israel, Iran, Jordan, Pakistan,
                                Saudi Arabia—are worried about threats from the Soviet Union or its
                                clients. Their strong preference is for us to provide increased
                                military, economic and political support to permit them to resist
                                “radical” pressures. We can draw on their concerns to strengthen our
                                position in the area through fairly routine measures.</p>
                            <p>In this approach, the United States would seek to maximize the number
                                of its friends in the area by providing aid and support when
                                opportunities to do so arise. Little effort would be spent on trying
                                to compete for the favors of Soviet clients or on encouraging the
                                development of relations among the countries of the area.</p>

                                primary means of limiting Soviet influence. At the same time, it may
                                suggest a less direct form of US involvement and a conscious
                                decision to place some limits on certain bilateral relations in

                                relationship between Iran, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, with further
                                linkages to Pakistan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Egypt and even Israel. For
                                these relations to take on substance, the United States cannot be
                                too intimately involved in their creation. Instead, we have to
                                relate indirectly to the process, lending aid where needed, but
                                relying primarily on the self-<pb facs="0077" n="42" xml:id="pg_42"
                                />interest of the regional actors to develop an informal security
                                and development network within their own area.</p>
                            <p>In addition to encouraging these relations, the United States, under
                                this approach, would deal with regional disputes in a generally
                                “even handed” manner in an effort to retain access to both sides of
                                any conflict. In South Asia, this would suggest a restrained arms
                                policy and efforts to cultivate both Pakistan and India. In the
                                Persian Gulf, the main danger to be avoided is an exacerbation of
                                Iranian-Saudi Arabian relations, which may require that we cut back
                                somewhat in our generous arms policy toward Iran or enhance the
                                quality of our relations with Saudi Arabia.</p>
                            <p>In the Middle East, the object of a balanced US policy would be to
                                gain influence in Egypt, which, as the most important Arab country,
                                continues to have a significant ability to affect US interests
                                throughout the Arab world.</p>
                            <p>One practical test of this policy approach could be presented in the
                                near future if President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                    >Sadat</persName> further downgrades his relationship with the
                                Soviet Union and replaces its support with Saudi financing of
                                European arms purchases. The Saudis have indicated that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> is considering this
                                possibility and have queried as to whether we would have any
                                objections. Encouraging the Saudi-Egyptian relationship, and perhaps
                                following it up with efforts to engage Egypt in serious peace
                                negotiations, would be consistent with this general approach.</p>
                            <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Concentrate on points of strength.</hi> This
                                approach differs from the others primarily by emphasizing the
                                importance of our relations with a few key countries in the
                                area—Israel, Iran and Ethiopia at a minimum, and perhaps Saudi
                                Arabia because of its oil wealth. These few key countries would
                                receive generous military support (and economic if needed) and in
                                turn would be encouraged to help defend US interests in other parts
                                of the region. Israel would play a special role in protecting the
                                regimes in Lebanon and Jordan and in limiting Egypt’s ability to
                                attack US interests in the Arab world. Iran would be expected to
                                perform a comparable task in the Persian Gulf. Ethiopia might have a
                                special place in securing transit through the Red Sea and in
                                countering radical trends on the periphery of the Arabian
                                Peninsula.</p>
                            <p>The Israelis enthusiastically support this view, arguing that as the
                                strongest military power in the region, Israel can play a
                                significant role in limiting Soviet influence. In addition to
                                providing direct protection to pro-Western regimes in Jordan and
                                Lebanon, Israel, by maintaining clear military superiority over
                                Egypt and Syria, shows up the ineffectiveness of Soviet support and
                                discredits the pro-Soviet policies of these countries. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s expulsion of Soviet
                                advisers was one positive result of this policy.</p>
                            <p>The main drawback of this strategy is that it reduces the ability of
                                the United States to develop its own base of influence in countries
                                such <pb facs="0078" n="43" xml:id="pg_43"/> as Egypt, Syria, Iraq
                                and India, and could limit our effectiveness in dealing with Saudi
                                Arabia if we continue support of Israel and Iran at present levels.
                                This approach has the elements of polarizing the area between pro-US
                                and pro-Soviet forces, and while protecting US interests and
                                limiting Soviet influence in a large part of the region, it does
                                little to enhance US opportunities in the Arab world and inhibits
                                the development of a potentially more stable regional balance of
                                power system.</p>
                            <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Seek US-Soviet Understandings on Regional
                                    Issues</hi>. The thrust of this approach would be to draw on the
                                substance of the global US-Soviet relationship to limit the
                                competitive and potentially dangerous aspects of US-Soviet rivalry
                                in this region. At a minimum we might seek to clarify how we could
                                behave in future conflict situations (e.g., Arab-Israeli, Lebanon,
                                Pakistan-India); on the disposition of our military forces in the
                                Mediterranean, Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean; and on the quality and
                                quantity of arms provided to states in the area. More ambitiously,
                                we might seek Soviet agreement on principles of an Arab-Israeli
                                settlement and enlist their support in gaining Egyptian and Syrian
                                cooperation. In the Persian Gulf area, we might agree to complement
                                Soviet efforts to moderate Iraqi behavior by encouraging the Shah to
                                pursue a more relaxed policy toward Iraq by resuming private
                                contacts. Finally, in the field of energy, we could seek Soviet
                                agreements on the importance of the free flow of oil from the
                                Persian Gulf and might even propose a joint US-Soviet venture with
                                the Iraqis to expand production from their vast reserves.</p>

                        <p>—the paper should be finished within a week so as to provide guidance to

                                >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> I would like to say a word about the
                            genesis of this meeting. It is not geared to produce immediate, concrete
                            decisions. However, when we talk to various countries—Iran, Pakistan, to
                            some extent the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>—they see the area
                            and believe the Soviets do also, as a strategic whole from India through
                            Turkey. We don’t see it as a cohesive unit and our policy is conducted
                            more on a bilateral basis. Next week we will discuss the Persian Gulf
                            and Arabian Peninsula in <pb facs="0080" n="45" xml:id="pg_45"/> more
                            detail. But I wanted to get a preparatory judgment from you on how we
                            view the area. If we should think of it as a cohesive unit, how should
                            we approach it? It is possible that the Soviet Union is explicitly
                            treating it as a cohesive unit and that they are planning a pincers move
                            through Iraq and Iran. It is also possible to look at it as a unit
                            without granting the theory of a Soviet long-range plan. It is possible
                            that the Soviets have a less specific long-range plan. We have never had
                            an explicit approach to the area, and I would like a discussion of this
                            as a basis for next week’s more detailed meeting. Could we hear from

                            I saw this text only about an hour ago and I don’t entirely agree with
                            it. The Soviets have introduced TU–22 medium bombers into Iraq. This is
                            the first time these bombers have been seen outside the Soviet Union.

                            surprising. There is a schizophrenic quality in Soviet policy. The fact
                            that they are seeking détente in Western Europe doesn’t mean that they
                            want détente in the Middle East. They’re pushing political disarmament
                            of the West; but if that fails, they want a second option. They want a
                            stranglehold on our energy sources.</p>

                            complete the steel mill or build the natural gas pipeline, it’s good for
                            Iran and it’s good for the Russians. It breaks down some of their
                            historical barriers and the traditional belief that the Soviets are the
                            enemy. This is against our interest.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>:</hi>
                            I agree that the Soviets look at the area as a strategic whole but the
                            Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula have one set of unique problems,
                            and the traditional Middle East has another set of unique problems. They
                            overlap, of course, in the Arab-Israeli dispute. But I don’t think that
                            the Soviets have a systematic policy leading to Soviet-Iraqi and
                            Soviet-Indian access that Pakistan says they have. They would like to
                            get us out of Europe. And they are pursuing an opportunistic strategy of
                            probing soft spots and seeking to enhance their position everywhere they
                            can without risking confrontation. I think they will continue their
                            policy of proxy aggression. I think the concerns of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZ_1">Bhutto</persName> and the Shah are somewhat
                            exaggerated but that their assessment is fundamentally sound. Our
                            policies should be responsive to their increasing concerns which are
                            based on such things as the exodus of the British, the increase in
                            Soviet military supply, Soviet support of the radical regime in Aden,
                            increased Soviet activities in the Persian Gulf, and the increase of
                            Soviet capability in the Indian Ocean. I think it is important that we
                            be responsive to these concerns and that we not be asleep.</p>

                            There are a series of regional and local problems. The Soviets have many
                            fish to fry in this area, but the Shah is ambivalent. He wants the
                            relationship with the Russians, but he thinks the Indians are trying to
                            spread their influence with Russian help and that they are trying to
                            dismember Pakistan. The <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> is, of
                            course, in the background. There are a series of regions. The Shah is
                            looking north to Russia, east <pb facs="0082" n="47" xml:id="pg_47"/> to
                            Pakistan and India, south to the Persian Gulf, and west to Iraq. This is
                            not a simplistic issue; it is highly complex.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> It could be a strategic region with all
                            of the characteristics you describe. It is possible that India and Iran
                            are not part of a deliberate master plan which would have Iraq moving in
                            on Iran. I agree that the Shah is trying to get as many anchors to
                            windward as possible, but that doesn’t change the basic fact. Indian
                            policy may be to surround itself with a series of Bhutans and
                            Sikkims.</p>

                        <p>—To follow up the effort begun at last Friday’s <gloss target="#t_SRG_1"
                                >SRG</gloss> meeting to define a strategy for the area ranging from
                            the Indian subcontinent to the eastern Mediterranean and the Horn of
                            Africa. This is relevant to your meeting with the Shah next Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>—To address specific issues relating to our policy toward the Arabian
                            Peninsula and Persian Gulf (<gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 181).
                            Again, this will be useful before you see the Shah because it raises the
                            basic question of whether we can continue in real terms to press for
                            Saudi-Iranian cooperation in maintaining Gulf stability.</p>
                        <p>Specifically <hi rend="italic">what you want from the meeting</hi> is as
                            follows:</p>

                            presents a choice between two strategies, but I do not feel their
                            formulation is helpful. I have drafted an alternative.</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">State</hi> puts its alternatives this way:</p>
                            <p>(a) One approach would be to counter the Soviets as actively as
                                possible;</p>
                            <p>(b) the other would be to concentrate on resolving local conflicts
                                and reducing local tensions on the assumption that that will reduce
                                Soviet opportunities for expanding influence.</p>
                            <p>—I have written an <hi rend="italic">alternative</hi> formulation
                                which may require further work, but I feel it is closer to the mark.
                                This poses a choice between: (a) a “neo-containment” strategy of
                                concentrating heavily on Iran, Tur<pb facs="0085" n="50"
                                    xml:id="pg_50"/>key, Israel and Ethiopia with secondary
                                concentration on Pakistan and Jordan; and (b) a modification of the
                                former which concentrates on strengthening the associations among
                                those powers and also drawing in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the
                                peripheral states on the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>After discussion at the meeting, I suggest you instruct State to try to
                            refine these strategies and that you give an indication of how you view
                            the issues involved.</p>

                            The basic issue to be discussed is the assumption which has been at the
                            base of our policy to date—that <hi rend="italic">Iranian-Saudi
                                cooperation</hi> is the best guarantee of stability in the Gulf. The
                            issues are whether the Saudis are showing the capacity to hold up their
                            end of the cooperation and whether the relationship between Iran and
                            Saudi Arabia is good enough so that it is realistic to think in terms of
                            such cooperation. The alternative into which we are drifting is to
                            assume that the Iranians will take care of stability in the Gulf. A
                            second issue is how effective the <hi rend="italic">Jordanian role</hi>
                            can be in this area and whether we, the Iranians and the Saudis want a
                            Jordanian role there badly enough for someone to pay for it. Finally,
                            these specific issues could be discussed with an eye toward early
                            decision:</p>

                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">Should we expand our diplomatic and commercial

                                whether we should upgrade our presence in every Gulf post or whether
                                we should begin selectively in the Union of Arab Emirates and in
                                Oman.</p>
                            <p>—You may wish to discuss the question of <hi rend="italic">how we

                                pressed on the question of the mission to Saudi Arabia. Since the
                                political mission as now proposed is cumbersome and is not likely to
                                be able to convey the right message, you might want to raise the
                                question of inviting Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                    >Fahd</persName> to come here. This would avoid <persName

                                also permit you to have a talk with him.</p>
                            <p>—You might ask for a decision memo on <hi rend="italic">military

                            good shape. You may not have time to deal with this at the meeting, but
                            you will want to read it before talking with the Shah. If you want to
                            get a quick sense of the group’s feeling, the key issue is how
                            extensively we should do some advanced thinking with the Shah and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>. Otherwise you can

                        <p>Three papers are available at succeeding tabs for this meeting:</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">“Regional Strategy Paper.”</hi> This is the paper
                            you asked <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Joe Sisco</persName> for at the
                                <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> meeting last Friday. It is an
                            effort to define a regional <pb facs="0086" n="51" xml:id="pg_51"/>
                            strategy. Sub-tabs identify alternative formulations of this strategy,
                            one in the State paper and another by me.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">“Peninsula/Gulf Paper.”</hi> This is the paper
                            prepared in response to <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 181 which
                            asked for a study of the situation and our options in the Arabian
                            Peninsula and the Persian Gulf. This leaves aside such issues as oil and
                            financial problems and the Arab-Israeli conflict and concentrates on the
                            political-security relationships in the Gulf and Peninsula.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">“Saudi Contingency Plan.”</hi> Included for your

                                >talking points are at the next tab</hi>. They suggest that you
                            first take up the regional strategy issue which is carried over from
                            last week. Then you could move to the Peninsula/Gulf paper [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. If time
                            allows, a short discussion of the Saudi contingency plan would fit into
                            the broader discussion of the Peninsula/Gulf area.</p>

                        <p>In response to your requests at the <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss>
                            meeting on <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 182, the State
                            Department has produced a short paper (immediately <pb facs="0087"
                                n="52" xml:id="pg_52"/> following) on what regional strategies might
                            look like if we were to think in terms of the entire area from the
                            Indian subcontinent to the eastern Mediterranean and Horn of Africa.
                            This paper is essentially a think-piece which tries to define possible
                            strategies. Once an approach is defined, the next stage would be to
                            think through in more detail what courses of action one might follow in
                            implementing such strategies. The paper now contains a variety of
                            suggested actions to illustrate the differences between the two
                            suggested strategies, but their purpose at this point is essentially
                            illustrative.</p>
                        <p>The principal issue is how to define the strategies. This has been
                            difficult and there has not been agreement. This summary will describe
                            the issue. At sub-tabs in the attached State paper you will find
                            alternative formulations—one is State’s, the other is mine.</p>
                        <p>Following is a summary of the main points in the paper:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">I.</hi> How the Soviets see the
                            region.</p>
                        <p>The paper judges that, while both the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> take actions that affect the entire region, the
                            Soviets probably have less of an integrated concept of the region than
                            we do. They tend to see it in two ways: (1) as a part of the Asian
                            rimland stretching from Turkey to Korea which is vital to them both
                            because parts of it lie along Soviet borders and because other parts
                            encircle China; or (2) as a series of individual countries or conflict
                            situations toward which they must develop policy approaches. They have
                            several interests:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—Their general determination to play a global role compels them to
                                want to assure that no important decisions can be taken here, as
                                elsewhere, without Soviet interest being taken into account.</p>
                            <p>—The paramount Soviet interest here is national security.</p>
                            <p>—A third objective is the avoidance of any risk of nuclear conflict
                                in this area.</p>
                            <p>—The Soviets also have an interest in the current pursuit of détente
                                with the West. But while the inter-related concerns of security and
                                détente have had some impact on Soviet actions in the area, this
                                impact has been differentiated by area and activity. Nowhere does
                                the Soviet pursuit of détente seem to have played a major
                                constraining role on efforts to increase Soviet influence.</p>
                            <p>—The Chinese impact on Soviet policy is not, on balance, a bad one
                                from the US viewpoint. It reinforces the current Soviet leaders’
                                predilection to be a status quo power, to discourage regional
                                conflicts or even domestic turbulence which might provide Peking
                                with opportunities for anti-Soviet exploitation. Probably above all,
                                Moscow is concerned about the prospects of Sino-US collusion in the
                                area.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>Thus, the paper concludes that the Soviets lay claim in the Middle East
                            to at least equal influence with the US and in South Asia probably feel
                            that they are entitled to preeminence. Their success in the final
                            analysis will depend on how well they satisfy the aspirations of the <pb
                                facs="0088" n="53" xml:id="pg_53"/> individual countries there. On
                            this, the prospects do not look bright, at least without cooperation
                            rather than competitive rivalry with the West and the US in
                            particular.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> How the US views the
                            region.</p>
                        <p>Historically, the US has formulated its policies toward this region on
                            the basis of two perceptions, often held simultaneously, never fully
                            reconciled and sometimes in conflict:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—One perception has been that the Soviet threat is the overriding
                                reality with which we must deal. In this view, conflicts, rivalries
                                and alignments within the region are secondary considerations
                                subordinate to the Soviet factor when it comes to assigning
                                priorities and making policy choices.</p>
                            <p>—The second perception has been that the separate sets of local
                                conflicts and problems within the region arising largely from
                                indigenous factors constitute the overriding realities with which we
                                must deal. Policies based on this perception have emphasized
                                strengthening our bilateral relationships across the board while
                                seeking to defuse or resolve local conflicts and to keep a foot in
                                both camps in local conflict situations.</p>

                        <p>The paper points out that a further characteristic of the US view of this
                            region has been a tendency to compartmentalize our approach into sets of
                            largely, though not exclusively, separate subregional policies in South
                            Asia, the Arabian Peninsula/Persian Gulf, the Arab-Israeli area and the
                            Horn of Africa. While we have tended to a compartmentalized view of the
                            region, the leaders and governments in the area often do not see it this
                            way. It is one of the new elements on the scene that there is a complex
                            of cross-regional relationships that suggest that we need to broaden our
                            perception of the region in recognition of that fact that our
                            compartmentalized view does not accord with the perceptions of many of
                            those in the area.</p>
                        <p>One other major new element in the equation of US-Soviet relations in
                            this region is the presumed Soviet desire to avoid situations that will
                            seriously jeopardize US–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> bilateral
                            relations and détente in Europe and could foster the coalescence of a
                            US-Chinese community of interests in this region. The priority the
                            Soviets attach to these new considerations and the price they are
                            prepared to pay for them in this region in terms of modifying their
                            traditional policies remain to be seen.</p>

                                this strategy.”</p>

                                they are unsatisfactory in the region. This strategy would be based
                                essentially on the premise that (1) local conflicts, in which the
                                Soviets align themselves with one side, have been a principal
                                vehicle for the expansion of Soviet influence, and (2) once the
                                pressures of those conflicts are relieved, the forces of nationalism
                                and fear of Soviet domination will operate to limit Soviet
                                inroads.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>The shortcoming of these formulations is that they are not real
                            alternatives. One says we should counter the Soviets and the other says
                            we should counter the Soviets by reducing local tensions. It seems to me
                                (<persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName>) that one can
                            assume that we will be working to increase our influence relative to the

                            different formulations and put them under the State paper as an
                            alternative ending to the paper. My formulations would go as

                                friendly toward us and with the power to dominate their respective

                                adventures of proxies in the area. This approach would give the US a
                                capacity through these friends to encourage their use of force in
                                support of other friendly governments without necessarily involving
                                ourselves militarily. It would also provide for the assertion of
                                influence in non-military ways since those countries that would be
                                identified as points of strength are also nations of considerable
                                economic weight.</p>
                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">Strategy 2</hi>. We could base our policies on the
                                view that, while building a strong relationship with the military
                                powers in the area, we would concentrate on encouraging the widest
                                possible network of associated states friendly to us. Many of these

                                We would also have to recognize that this strategy would require
                                more careful and continuous attention to policy in this region than

                            <p>In an area as diverse as the Region from the Subcontinent to the
                                Eastern Mediterranean and Horn of Africa, no power can have a
                                totally unified view of the Region or a single policy toward it.
                                Both the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> do, however, take actions that
                                affect the Region in the broader sense, and fit its component parts
                                into some sort of framework for analytical purposes. For a variety
                                of reasons, the Soviets probably have less of an integrated concept
                                of the Region than do we. Over the last two years we have more and
                                more looked at the Middle East, Persian Gulf, Arabian Peninsula and
                                South Asia in overall strategic terms, while recognizing each of the
                                aforementioned areas has problems unique to its own immediate
                                concerns in an increasingly overlapping context. The Soviets tend to
                                see the Region through two focuses:</p>
                            <p>—As part of the Asian rimland stretching from Turkey to Korea that is
                                of vital concern to them both because parts of it lie along Soviet
                                borders, and other parts of it encircle China. Moscow has
                                increasingly focused on this concept of Asia in recent
                                years—Brezhnev’s advocacy of an Asian security system is the best
                                known expression of this concern.</p>
                            <pb facs="0091" n="56" xml:id="pg_56"/>
                            <p>—As a series of individual countries or conflict situations toward
                                which the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> must develop policy
                                approaches. This traditional approach remains the mainstay of Soviet
                                policy and provides the framework within which we and they have, so
                                far at least, interacted.</p>
                            <p>Thus there is probably no precise, overall Soviet “grand design”
                                peculiarly tailored to the Region under discussion. As elsewhere,
                                Soviet policy is largely opportunistic, exploiting what
                                opportunities it perceives filtered through its special amalgam of
                                national interests and Communist dogma. The probable absence of a
                                precise, overall “grand design,” however, may make little
                                difference. Diverse considerations of both a global and a regional
                                nature in fact impinge on large parts of the Region. Regional states
                                are themselves forming ties across the various segments of the
                                Region. Consequently, we need to take account of the various factors
                                that bear upon Soviet activities in the Region with varying degrees
                                of intensity.</p>

                                interests of the Soviet Union being taken into account. But the

                                security. This is a dominating motivation in Soviet policy toward
                                the countries on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s
                                southern border, and an important consideration in Moscow’s Middle
                                East policy generally.</p>
                            <p>—A second overriding objective, and the major mutual interest the
                                Soviets share with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, is to
                                avoid any serious risk of nuclear conflict.</p>
                            <p>—Still another Soviet consideration is Moscow’s current pursuit of
                                détente with the West. Brezhnev has described it as basic strategy,
                                not tactics, and for a variety of reasons this seems to be true. It
                                is added reason for Soviet restraint on such critical issues as the
                                Arab-Israeli conflict, and also on other issues in the area which
                                are of vital concern to the West. For example, the Soviets are
                                unlikely to disrupt Middle East oil supply to the West, even if they
                                could, and the more so since they are currently in no position to
                                replace the West either as consumer or broker. They would certainly
                                like to have a major voice eventually in the disposition of the
                                area’s energy supplies, which in the long run they may need
                                themselves. They certainly entertain this fond expectation, but as a
                                distant goal and not feasible within the next ten years at
                                least.</p>
                            <p>The China factor looms large in Soviet foreign policy formulation,
                                but its importance also varies according to area and country. China
                                is not of major significance for Moscow in the Arab-Israeli conflict
                                or other important Middle East issues simply because the Chinese do
                                not <pb facs="0092" n="57" xml:id="pg_57"/> have the capability to
                                exert major influence in these areas. However, Moscow’s concern
                                about China is of paramount importance in Soviet policy formulation
                                on the subcontinent, and probably also in Moscow’s desire to extend
                                its influence into the Indian Ocean.</p>
                            <p>The China impact on Soviet policy is not, on balance, a pernicious
                                one from the point of view of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                                interests. To the contrary, it reinforces the current Soviet
                                leaders’ predilection to be a <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                                power, to discourage regional conflicts or even domestic turbulence
                                in individual countries which might provide Peking with
                                opportunities for anti-Soviet exploitation. Probably above all,
                                Moscow is concerned about the prospect of Sino-<gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> collusion in regional conflicts in
                                the area such as it professed to see in the Indo-Pakistan War of
                                1971.</p>
                            <p>The interrelated concerns of security and détente have had some
                                impact on Soviet actions in the area, but this impact has been
                                differentiated by area and activity. In the Middle East, the Soviets
                                are much more acutely aware of the security problem and the danger
                                of confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Their
                                posture there emphasizes military aspects and is more cautious. In
                                South Asia, their approach is more political and under fewer
                                restraints since they see less risk of a collision with the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Nowhere, however, has the Soviet
                                pursuit of détente thus far played a major constraining role on
                                efforts to increase Soviet influence through such time-honored
                                techniques as military and economic assistance. And nowhere in the
                                area does the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> grant the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> pride of place. In the
                                Middle East, they lay claim to at least equal influence, and in
                                South Asia probably feel that they are entitled to preeminence. In
                                the Gulf and Arabian Peninsula, they are seeking to consolidate
                                their positions in Iraq and, by their support of Aden and military
                                assistance programs to Somalia, attest to the strategic importance
                                they attach to the tip of the Arabian Peninsula and entrance to the
                                Red Sea, Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula.</p>
                            <p>The Soviets will seek to pursue their traditional tactic of
                                exploiting regional disputes to further their own influence,
                                endeavoring simultaneously to work both sides of the fence. They
                                will take advantage of the special opportunity that Iraq offers them
                                to advance their interests in the Middle East and Persian Gulf area,
                                while at the same time striving to maintain good relations with
                                Iraq’s major rival, Iran, and getting the Shah accustomed to live
                                with the situation. Moscow appears to want to show some greater
                                even-handedness toward India and Pakistan, even though it is obvious
                                that in a crunch India will be favored. The Soviets also endeavor to
                                take advantage of Somalia’s concerns and ambitions vis-à-vis its
                                neighbors to obtain facilities that will enhance Soviet strategic
                                capabilities in the Indian Ocean, yet they carefully cultivate
                                Somalia’s neighbors. And Soviet exploitation of the conflict between
                                the two Yemens, and between South Yemen and <pb facs="0093" n="58"
                                    xml:id="pg_58"/> Oman, has the same objectives and is
                                characterized by the same attempt to maintain a balance on both
                                sides. The tactic to date has been highly successful in expanding
                                Soviet influence into the area, reinforcing its geopolitical
                                advantages and in giving the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                                a voice as major arbiter in its affairs.</p>
                            <p>Soviet standing in the final analysis will, however, depend on how
                                successful Moscow is in satisfying the aspirations of the individual
                                countries there. Here the prospects do not look too bright, at least
                                without cooperation rather than competitive rivalry with the West,
                                and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in particular. Moscow’s
                                impotence in achieving progress toward a settlement of the
                                Arab-Israeli conflict has been demonstrated in Soviet unwillingness
                                to run risks of major confrontation and their inability to influence
                                the major country in the equation—Israel. Their presence in the
                                volatile Arab countries of the Middle East is tenuous, as the
                                example of Egypt has shown, and involves a heavy political/economic
                                commitment. And Moscow’s hope to be the major arbiter of affairs on
                                the subcontinent could raise the prospect of heavy economic
                                commitments to India which could impose a serious burden on Soviet
                                resources. In sum, the Soviets are on the make, but are paying a
                                price, and the price is constantly going up.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> How the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Views the Region</p>
                            <p>Historically, we have formulated our policies in this Region on the
                                basis of two perceptions, often held simultaneously, never fully
                                reconciled and sometimes in direct conflict.</p>
                            <p>One perception has been that the Soviet threat is the overriding
                                reality with which we must deal. In this view, conflicts, rivalries
                                and alignments within the Region are secondary considerations, not
                                to be ignored but subordinate to the Soviet factor when it comes to
                                assigning priorities and making policy choices. It is largely this
                                perception that has led us to sponsor and support regional defense
                                groupings (the abortive Middle East Defense Organization, the
                                Baghdad Pact and <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss>) and to
                                concentrate on strengthening militarily key states in the Region
                                opposed to the Soviets or to Soviet-supported neighbors (Ethiopia,
                                Israel, Turkey, Iran and—until 1965—Pakistan).</p>
                            <p>The second perception has been that the separate sets of local
                                conflicts and problems within the Region, arising largely from
                                indigenous factors, constitute the overriding realities with which
                                we must deal. In this view the Soviet factor—while not to be
                                ignored—is often a kind of secondary infection rather than a primary
                                cause, so that measures to cope with it directly must be subordinate
                                to policies aimed at dealing with local situations within the
                                Region. Policies based on this perception have emphasized
                                strengthening our bilateral relationships across-the-board while
                                seeking to defuse or resolve local conflicts and to keep a foot in
                                both camps in local conflict situations.</p>
                            <pb facs="0094" n="59" xml:id="pg_59"/>
                            <p>When these two perceptions (and the policies flowing from them) have
                                come into conflict in deciding how we should act or respond in
                                specific situations, the former has historically tended to prevail.
                                The result has often been that our perceived need to demonstrate
                                strength directly and/or through our friends vis-à-vis the Soviets
                                has exacerbated certain of our bilateral relationships in the Region
                                and limited our ability to influence the resolution of local
                                conflicts.</p>
                            <p>A further characteristic of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                                view of this Region has been a tendency to compartmentalize our
                                approach into sets of largely (though not exclusively) separate
                                sub-regional policies. This approach has changed in the last
                                eighteen months in the aftermath of the British exodus from the
                                Gulf, the upsetting of the balance in South Asia, and the increasing
                                awareness of our energy resource needs from the Gulf and Arabian
                                Peninsula. Thus a brief description of our policies in the Region
                                would look something like this:</p>

                                and adopt a low-key posture in our bilateral relations.</p>
                            <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Arabian Peninsula/Persian Gulf</hi>—play a

                                cooperative measures among the states of this sub-region; strengthen
                                key states militarily—Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait—against the threats
                                they perceive to themselves and their neighbors from
                                Soviet-supported states in the area; seek to deepen our relations
                                with the key oil producers to safeguard our energy supplies, and to
                                insulate this sub-region from the spillover effects of the
                                Arab-Israel problem.</p>

                                meanwhile safeguard the ceasefire by maintaining the military
                                balance through military supplies to Israel, and strengthen the Arab
                                moderates (Jordan and Lebanon) to withstand radical pressures.</p>
                            <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Horn of Africa</hi>—continue to give priority to
                                close relations with Ethiopia and Kenya while seeking to broaden our

                                problems within an African context.</p>
                            <p>The leaders and the governments in the area see matters primarily in
                                overall regional strategic terms, and there is a deep suspicion of
                                Soviet-sponsored subversion, a lingering fear that détente will blur
                                America’s perception, awareness and responsiveness to continued
                                Soviet probes of soft spots and creeping expansionism. The Shah is
                                concerned not only about the Gulf but also about Pakistan and the
                                threat he sees from Soviet-Indian ties. India is seeking to
                                strengthen ties with Iraq. Pakistan has tightened its links with
                                Iran and has military assistance relationships with Jordan and Arab
                                Gulf states. Saudi Arabia <pb facs="0095" n="60" xml:id="pg_60"/>
                                and Egypt have increasingly close ties, and <persName

                                relationship with Iran and Ethiopia and also has ties with Turkey—a
                                quadrumvirate which in Israeli strategic thinking should, with
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> backing, constitute the
                                basic structure for countering Soviet inroads into the Region. In
                                Ethiopia, the Emperor sees his country not just as an African
                                country with African interests but as a bastion in the path of
                                Soviet ambitions in the Near East.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing observations suggest that we need to heighten even more
                                our perceptions of the overall strategic elements of the Region in
                                recognition of the fact that a compartmentalized view does not
                                accord with the perceptions of many of those in the area, which need
                                to be taken into account in our approach to the Region and to our
                                relations with them. This broadened perception makes sense
                                independent of any Soviet role or overall Soviet perception,
                                although it could be most useful in dealing with Soviet
                                trans-regional activities. At the same time we should recognize the
                                basic instability of most of the states of the region and that their
                                perceptions, consequently, are liable to sudden change—e.g.,
                                following the division of Pakistan or the overthrow of the Mosadeq
                                regime in Iran.</p>
                            <p>Finally, our thinking and approach must also take into account the
                                new emphasis in the equation of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Soviet relations in this Region which has not been
                                historically present. This is the presumed Soviet desire to avoid
                                situations that will seriously jeopardize <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                    >U.S.</gloss>-Soviet bilateral relations and détente in Europe
                                and could foster the coalescence of a <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                    >U.S.</gloss>-Chinese community of interests in the Region. The
                                priority the Soviets attach to these new considerations and the
                                price they are prepared to pay for them, in terms of modifying their
                                traditional policies in the Region, remain to be seen but should be
                                tested. Certainly the Soviets will not easily abandon those
                                policies, if at all—the exploitation of local tensions; the
                                provision of arms, economic aid and political support to tie
                                countries of the Region to them; the probing for weak spots to
                                undermine the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position and
                                extend their own. Today the Soviets are pursuing a policy of seeking
                                to disarm the West and Europe while trying to maintain, develop and
                                enhance their position in the Middle East, South Asia, the Persian
                                Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula. They can do this today with less
                                risk of confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                                than in times past.</p>
                            <p>Modification of such Soviet policies would help the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position in the Region, which is
                                certainly not a goal of Soviet strategy. The extent to which they
                                may nevertheless be prepared to move in this direction will depend
                                on their assessment of the relative costs and <pb facs="0096" n="61"
                                    xml:id="pg_61"/> benefits of not doing so—an assessment which
                                will in turn depend on the extent to which we are prepared to take
                                risks to make those costs and benefits clear to them. Also, of
                                course, the Soviets will expect us to make reciprocal concessions.
                                The Soviets are acting now in the area on the assumption that there
                                is wide strategic latitude, and they have not been particularly
                                inhibited—short of confrontation—in seeking to exploit opportunities
                                in the area. For example, to compensate for the Egyptian loss there
                                has been a meaningful increase of Soviet supply of Syria and a
                                continuance of Soviet supply of Iraq and Aden. Even in
                                Afghanistan—while there is no evidence they had a direct hand in the
                                coup—no such coup could take place without at least the acquiescence
                                of the Soviets who have military advisors at every level of the
                                Afghan Army.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">III.</hi> Toward a Regional
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Strategy</p>
                            <p>From the foregoing, it seems possible to state certain assumptions on
                                which to base a regional strategy:</p>
                            <p>A. The Soviets seek predominant influence if not hegemony in this
                                area, although they may have no overall, well-coordinated “grand
                                design” there.</p>
                            <p>B. The region is so important to the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                    >U.S.</gloss> that we will want to remain in a position to
                                influence developments there.</p>
                            <p>C. Thus both the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the Soviet
                                Union will be competing for influence vis-á-vis the other. One
                                important standard for measuring success will be the ability of each
                                side to help nations in the area to fulfill their aspirations, one
                                of which is preserving their own security and independence.</p>
                            <p>D. The issue for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, therefore,
                                is what combination of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> actions
                                and what kind of relationships with and among the nations of the
                                region will enhance <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> influence
                                there. Since this is a diverse area with many conflicts cutting
                                across it, the choice for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                                is how to build the strongest possible position in the area
                                consistent with its many interests, one of which is maintaining or
                                enhancing its influence vis-á-vis the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                    >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>Before attempting to define two possible strategies for discussion,
                                two other approaches need to be mentioned:</p>
                            <p>A. It is assumed that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will
                                continue to conduct active bilateral relations with most of the
                                nations in the area, taking into account the special problems of
                                each of the main sub-regions in the area. That has essentially been
                                the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy. All of those
                                relationships together could continue to comprise a <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> approach to the area. This
                                approach is not dealt with in detail here because the purpose of
                                this paper is to examine whether a new dimension would be suggested
                                by looking even more broadly at the area as a whole.</p>
                            <pb facs="0097" n="62" xml:id="pg_62"/>
                            <p>B. It is also assumed that in connection with any strategy mentioned
                                in this paper, we could probe to see where Soviet cooperation might
                                be enlisted in reducing local tensions.</p>
                            <p>Conceptually, we can adopt one of the two broad strategies outlined
                                below in our approach to this Region. In the real world, it is
                                difficult to envisage a situation where we would follow totally one
                                or the other. Any set of policies and actions is likely to involve
                                some mix of the two. However, if we define them in this way and opt
                                for one or the other as the basic framework for our approach to the
                                Region, this will provide a consistent guide as to where we place
                                our emphasis, how we determine priorities when there are choices to
                                be made, and how we assess the risks involved.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Strategy One</p>
                            <p>We can base our policies on the view that, to protect our interests
                                in the Region, we need to move more actively to counter the Soviets
                                where we believe those interests threatened or, alternatively, build
                                up proxies who can do the job. While continuing to seek improvements
                                in our bilateral relationships in the Region and the elimination of
                                sources of local tension, we would not let such considerations stand
                                in the way of actions we deemed necessary to carry out the main
                                thrust of this strategy.</p>
                            <p>In terms of specific regional situations, the policy implications
                                flowing from this strategy could include the following:</p>
                            <p>A. Build up according to their requests the military capabilities of
                                the major military powers in the region—Iran, Israel, Ethiopia, and
                                Turkey. We would go on providing arms to other countries in the
                                region but (1) would be guided by the major regional powers’ views
                                on any limits on type or quantities of equipment that should be
                                imposed and (2) would make no effort to limit their own equipment
                                regardless of the sensitivities of others in the area.</p>
                            <p>B. Rely heavily on the military action of those countries to confront
                                aggression in their areas (e.g., Iran to support Kuwait and Pakistan
                                against Iraq and India, Israel to support Lebanon and Jordan against
                                Syria and Iraq) or to restore stability (e.g., Iranian action in a
                                chaotic situation in a Gulf state, Israel in Jordan, Iran in
                                Pakistan).</p>
                            <p>C. Concentrate special military and economic assistance on Pakistan
                                because of their importance to the stability of Iran. We would do
                                this accepting its negative effect on our relationships with India
                                (1) because of the greater importance of the Persian Gulf than of
                                South Asia and (2) because of the importance of demonstrating to
                                both the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss
                                    target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> as well as to other nations in the
                                area that friends of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> fare
                                better than friends of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                                (like India).</p>
                            <p>D. We would concentrate special military and economic assistance on
                                Jordan because of its importance to the security of Israel and to
                                the <pb facs="0098" n="63" xml:id="pg_63"/> avoidance of
                                Arab-Israeli hostilities which could draw the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> into the conflict.</p>
                            <p>E. In the settlement of sub-regional disputes, an effort would be
                                made to assure that our friends negotiated from a position of
                                strength.</p>
                            <p>F. Step up our naval presence in the Indian Ocean—Arabian Sea—Persian
                                Gulf—Red Sea area and seek opportunities for demonstrations of our
                                military air capabilities in the Region.</p>
                            <p>G. Promote more active, broadly based and institutionalized regional
                                security measures among friendly states in the area (e.g., Israel,
                                Iran, Ethiopia, Turkey) to the extent local antagonisms—as between
                                Israel and moderate, pro-Western Arabs—make this feasible.</p>
                            <p>H. Undertake a more direct U.S.G. role to supplement
                                    Saudi/Iranian/Jordanian/<gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>

                                resources as needed from other areas.</p>
                            <p>I. Explore possibilities for covert actions against Soviet-supported
                                regimes in Iraq [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                                and in Syria.</p>
                            <p>This strategy vigorously pursued would demonstrate to the Soviets
                                that we were not being lulled by détente in Europe and progress in
                                our bilateral relations into acquiescing in the consolidation and
                                extension of their position, whether directly or by proxy, in the
                                Region. It would be a strategy welcomed by a number of our friends
                                in the area, though certain aspects of it [<hi rend="italic">less
                                    than 1 line not declassified</hi>] would cause concern to other

                                    declassified</hi>]. At the same time it would tend to polarize
                                local conflict situations and reduce our ability to defuse threats
                                to our interests arising out of such situations—[<hi rend="italic">6

                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Strategy Two</p>
                            <p>We can base our policies on the view that our interests will best be
                                served and Soviet influence checked and reduced by relying heavily
                                on the nationalism of the regional states and concentrating on the
                                resolution of local conflicts and the improvement of our bilateral
                                relationships where they are unsatisfactory in the Region. This
                                strategy would be based essentially on the premise that (1) local
                                conflicts, in which the Soviets align themselves with one side, have
                                been a principal vehicle for the expansion of Soviet influence, and
                                (2) the forces of nationalism and fear of Soviet domination will
                                operate to limit Soviet inroads, especially once the pressures of
                                local conflicts are relieved.</p>
                            <p>In terms of specific regional situations, the policies flowing from
                                such a strategy could include the following:</p>
                            <p>A. Seek to enlist Soviet cooperation in defusing local conflicts and
                                limiting our respective military inputs into the Region, through a
                                systematic dialogue with them about each of our policies toward and
                                    <pb facs="0099" n="64" xml:id="pg_64"/> interests in the Region
                                as a whole. This could begin by exploring whether our positions are
                                compatible to some degree and whether we can achieve mutual
                                acknowledgment of the importance of the Region to both of us. The
                                1969 Brezhnev Asian security proposal could provide a possible
                                framework for such explorations.</p>
                            <p>B. Be less forthcoming with respect to rates and magnitude of
                                delivery and levels of sophistication, in responding to arms
                                requests from our friends, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                    declassified</hi>].</p>
                            <p>C. Engage the Soviets, if possible, in agreements for selective
                                mutual reductions in military supply to our respective clients.</p>
                            <p>D. Maintain but do not increase our present military profile in the
                                Region. Explore with the Soviets the possibility of at least tacit
                                mutual restraint in our military postures, notably in our naval
                                presences in the Indian Ocean (cf. <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                                    >NSSM</gloss>–110).</p>
                            <p>E. Seek to persuade friendly states in the area to channel more of
                                their efforts at regional cooperation into economic development
                                rather than military and security-oriented programs. As one example,
                                encourage Pakistan, Iran, the Peninsula/Gulf states and Jordan to
                                develop areas of cooperation that utilize the particular human,
                                financial and technical resources each has to offer. Reallocate from
                                other regions available <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                                economic and technical assistance resources to help support such
                                efforts in a coordinating and pump-priming role.</p>
                            <p>F. Promote a closer relationship between Ethiopia and the moderate
                                Arabs and Iran while encouraging Israel to lower the visibility of
                                its program without reducing it. Particularly encourage the
                                cultivation of mutual interests among Ethiopia, North Yemen and
                                Saudi Arabia.</p>
                            <p>G. With respect to the Soviet-supported regime in <gloss

                                strengthening the economic, social and political fabric of North
                                Yemen and Oman, [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>]</p>
                            <p>H. With respect to Iraq, foster the present trend toward conciliation
                                with Iran and the Kurds and more pragmatic relations with western
                                nations.</p>
                            <p>I. In the subcontinent, continue to encourage resolution of
                                Pakistani-Indian-Bangladesh issues on the basis of the Simla
                                agreement, avoiding advocacy of any party’s position. Continue
                                efforts to normalize <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Indian
                                relations on a basis of reciprocity.</p>
                            <p>J. Temper somewhat our relationship with Pakistan and Israel so as to
                                preserve the possibility of some relationship with India and Egypt.
                                Actively encourage an even closer relationship between Saudi Arabia
                                and Egypt. At some point, this might require less than full support
                                for the diplomatic positions of Pakistan and Israel, although this
                                would not necessarily be the case.</p>
                            <pb facs="0100" n="65" xml:id="pg_65"/>
                            <p>K. Engage ourselves more directly in diplomatic efforts to move the
                                Arab-Israeli issue off dead center, even though this would
                                inevitably involve some strains in <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                    >U.S.</gloss>-Israeli relations.</p>
                            <p>L. Encourage India and Iran to talk out their differences and
                                cooperate in ensuring the security of the Western Indian Ocean
                                region.</p>
                            <p>In pursuing this strategy, we would start with certain advantages.
                                Taking the Region as a whole, we have a number of strong assets. For
                                the most part we, not the Soviets, have the militarily strong and
                                economically viable friends in the area. The Soviets, being both
                                powerful and geographically contiguous, are seen as a greater
                                longer-range threat by nationalistic local governments—even by those
                                presently allied with them. We only seek to prevent Soviet
                                domination of the Region, whereas the Soviets seek dominant
                                influence if not hegemony.</p>
                            <p>Against these advantages, the strategy outlined above has two
                                principal risks for us:</p>
                            <p>(1) It could be interpreted as weakness on our part by the Soviets
                                and extremist elements in the area, encouraging them to press for
                                additional advantages if we pursued to the fullest the course of
                                attempted accommodation this strategy suggests.</p>
                            <p>(2) It would have a seriously unsettling effect on our friends in the
                                Region, leading to shifts in their policies that could make even
                                more intractable the local conflicts we seek to resolve.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">IV.</hi> Conclusions</p>
                            <p>These two options are not mutually exclusive and in fact we have been
                                successfully pursuing the elements of both with the results that we
                                are limiting Soviet gains and in some instances even reversing the
                                trend. On balance, our basic interests of preventing Soviet
                                domination and maintaining access for ourselves, including to the
                                Region’s petroleum resources, have been preserved despite the
                                undeniable fact that the Soviets, while they have experienced some
                                setbacks, have improved their overall position in the Region as a
                                whole on the last decade. But, given the unnaturally low base from
                                which the Soviets started in the 1950’s, this is hardly surprising.
                                As we weigh our future strategy, the critical questions are
                                these:</p>
                            <p>(1) Can we assume that a continuation of policies based more on a
                                Strategy One than a Strategy Two approach will continue to protect
                                our vital interests in the Region? This question is especially
                                applicable to the Arab-Israel area, where a continuation of the
                                present impasse, in circumstances where we are seen as fully
                                identified with Israeli policies, casts a growing shadow over much
                                of the Region and in particular the Arabian Peninsula/Persian Gulf
                                area, playing into the hands of the Soviets and extremist elements
                                and creating crosscurrents that could increasingly affect our
                                ability to meet our growing energy <pb facs="0101" n="66"
                                    xml:id="pg_66"/> demands. In South Asia, where we would be
                                backing the weaker horse in Pakistan, this policy could also prove
                                costly.</p>
                            <p>(2) Are we prepared as an ultimate sanction to make clear to the
                                Soviets that our relations in this Region are an integral part of
                                our total relationship, and that this relationship with all its
                                evolving and complex advantages to both of us will be at stake?</p>
                            <p>(3) To support such a position, are we prepared to invoke the
                                prospect of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Chinese
                                collaboration in this Region?</p>
                            <p>(4) Are the Soviets prepared to accept the check on their historical
                                thrust into this Region which an approach along the lines of (2) and
                                (3) above would seek to achieve?</p>

                            deals with several broad issues that go beyond our bilateral relations
                            with the several states of the area.</p>

                            paper notes the growing importance of the region because of its oil; its
                            growing financial reserves; the persistence of disputes which may
                            provide opportunities for the Soviet Union to extend its influence into
                            the area. These issues, however, are all dealt with in more detail
                            elsewhere: oil in <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 174; financial
                            reserves by working groups preparing for possible high level economic
                            discussions with Saudi Arabia later in the year; and the Soviet threat
                            in <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 181. The other key issue which
                            is only mentioned in passing is the Arab-Israeli conflict and its effect
                            on US-Saudi relations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Iran</hi>. The Shah is determined to make Iran the
                            predominant military power in the region. In pursuit of this goal, the
                            Shah is often overbearing and heavy-handed in dealing with his Arab
                            neighbors, and the prospects for serious Iranian-Arab rivalry are
                            considerable in the future. This could be accentuated when Iran’s oil
                            production begins to peak out in the 1980s, while Saudi Arabia, Iraq and
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> continue to increase oil
                            production and earn revenues far in excess of Iran’s. It is this future
                            imbalance between military power on one side of the Gulf and economic
                            power on the other that poses dilemmas for the United States. These
                            dilemmas would, of course, be most easily overcome through Iranian-Saudi
                            cooperation, but that development cannot be taken for granted. In
                            dealing with Iran, we have essentially two broad approaches to
                            consider:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">Urge Iran to pursue policies in the Gulf that give
                                    high priority to coordination with Saudi Arabia and other
                                    friendly Arab states</hi>. This will require an ongoing dialogue
                                with the Shah about regional developments, and at times we may have
                                to urge him to show restraint in order to preserve the fabric of
                                Iranian-Arab cooperation. Insofar as this brings us into opposition
                                with some of the Shah’s policies, we may risk straining our
                                bilateral relations for the sake of regional cooperation.</p>
                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">Support the Shah as the major power of the
                                    region</hi>. The risk of this “blank check” policy toward Iran
                                is that it could encourage the Shah’s more imperial fancies,
                                resulting at worst in an over-extension of Iranian power and serious
                                conflicts with Iran’s neighbors, perhaps including the Soviet Union.
                                It is virtually certain that this policy would make Saudi-Iranian
                                cooperation difficult to achieve, but it is less obvious what the
                                price of non-cooperation would be.</p>

                            Arabia because of oil, so do the strains in US-Saudi relations. King

                            involved emotionally in the Arab-Israeli dispute and is under pressure
                            from Egypt to use his resources to bring about a change in US policy <pb
                                facs="0103" n="68" xml:id="pg_68"/> toward Israel. In order to
                            improve US-Saudi bilateral relations, two courses of action are
                            identified as imperative. First, the US must show convincing progress
                            toward an Arab-Israeli settlement or it must take some distance from its
                            position of full support for Israel. Second, it must help the Saudis
                            find ways of using oil revenues to develop productive enterprises within
                            Saudi Arabia and investment outlets abroad. The other area of concern to
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> is Saudi security
                            in the face of threats that he feels emanate from all quarters, but most

                                acknowledging that for now Iran is the dominant power in the area
                                and that Saudi Arabia must accept that reality and turn it to its
                                own advantage through cooperation.</p>

                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">Iran</hi>. In recent years Iran has begun to move
                                rapidly into the modern world, and we have acknowledged her growing
                                power and status. Is there now a danger that the Shah may overreach
                                his country’s real capabilities by using an excessive amount of his
                                oil revenues on expensive defense items that are irrelevant for
                                Iran’s real requirements (e.g., F–15s) and which will become a heavy
                                burden in the 1980s when oil production begins to decline? Would it
                                make sense to begin trying to direct the Iranian armed forces toward
                                a more sensible and less costly force structure designed more for
                                Iran’s genuine defense needs than for prestige purposes? If not, how
                                far are we willing to support the Shah if he begins to use his
                                forces across the Gulf in ways that are bound to alienate Saudi
                                Arabia and perhaps accelerate the radicalization of the Arab

                                such as including Saudi Arabia in discussions of trade and

                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">Kuwait.</hi> The <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                                    >NSSM</gloss> posed the question of what role Kuwait might play
                                in the Gulf and how we should respond to her defense needs. The
                                study did not deal with this issue, but we do have pending some
                                decisions on military equipment for Kuwait. If we were to go ahead
                                and meet these requests, how could we expect Kuwait to respond? Do
                                the Kuwaitis have a role to play in the lower Gulf or Oman? Can they
                                be brought to restore their subsidy to Jordan in return for
                                increased help from us in meeting their defense needs?</p>

                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">Iraq</hi>. Our relations with Baghdad are nearly
                                non-existent, and the Soviets seem to be well emplaced there. But
                                from time to time we see signs that Iraq wants to turn more to the
                                West, and in the aftermath of the recent coup attempt there this
                                theme was publicly stated. Oil companies and some European countries
                                are convinced that Iraq is second only to Saudi Arabia in terms of
                                oil reserves and would very much like to help the Iraqis increase
                                production. To encourage an Iraqi turning toward the West, do we
                                have any role to play, such as discussing with the Shah the
                                desirability of continuing his dialogue with Iraq; and abstaining
                                from active support for the Kurdish insurgents? Is there anything we
                                should do directly to make a gesture toward Baghdad?</p>

                                this area, how should we best position ourselves to deal with
                                expanding Soviet influence. Two general approaches have been
                                suggested: one would seek to contain the Soviets by building up
                                points of strength in the area; the other would emphasize the
                                development of a network of regional associations that would
                                restrict Soviet opportunities and draw on local forces to deal with
                                security problems. As applied to this area, what would these two
                                views imply?</p>

                            <p>—Saudi–Iranian cooperation is still to be desired, and we should

                                    >Faisal</persName>. Are the costs worth it?</p>
                            <p>—We should move to accord Saudi Arabia enhanced international status
                                and to encourage them to play a more responsive role in their
                                region. This should be one of the objects of any high-level
                                discussions with Saudi Arabia on political and economic issues later
                                this year. We should consider including the Saudis in monetary and

                            <p>—In Oman and Yemen, we may want to upgrade our presence on the

                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>], the contingency plan
                            assumes that a “radical” takeover is unlikely. In addition to internal
                            forces working against rapid change, there is little evidence of outside
                            interference or subversion. In addition, the geography of Saudi Arabia
                            makes it difficult for conspirators to seize control of the country or
                            its key power centers. A coup from within the armed forces cannot be
                            ruled out, but would be difficult to mount unless the air force and
                            airfields were controlled, since movement of troops over land would be
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>Possibly destabilizing factors might be the King’s death and a struggle
                            within the royal family for succession. A second source of pressure on
                            the regime stems from the unresolved status of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
                            The most likely contingency for the US, according to the plan, is not a
                            takeover by radical elements in Saudi Arabia, but <pb facs="0107" n="72"

                            deteriorates, perhaps as a result of anti-regime feeling stimulated by a
                            renewal of Arab-Israeli hostilities. The US would consider the following
                            courses of action:</p>
                        <quote>

                            <p>—Talk to Jordanians and Iranians about joint actions in event

                            <p>—Even in the absence of information about the new regime, pressures
                                would build on us to move rapidly, before the regime could establish
                                its credentials, to overthrow it. We would try to reach a judgment
                                with Jordan and Iran on whether such a move was justified.</p>
                            <p>—If so, Jordan would play the main role by trying to seize airfields
                                within Saudi Arabia and then carrying out air strikes against key
                                areas.</p>

                            Discussion</p>
                        <p>—A change of regime in Saudi Arabia will raise the question of whether to
                            intervene, and in what form, to reverse the situation. Pressures will be
                            intense to act rapidly, without much knowledge of the existing
                            situation. Are the risks of delay greater than the risks of
                            intervention? Does intervention stand a chance of success or is it
                            likely to fail?</p>
                        <p>—Recognizing the dangers for US interests elsewhere in the Arab world if
                            we were to intervene, the paper nonetheless suggests that the gains from
                            a successful military intervention that resulted in a stable pro-Western
                            regime staying in power would offset any losses elsewhere. But do we or
                            the Jordanians have the capabilities to intervene successfully unless a
                            substantial body of Saudi opinion favors such an intervention?</p>
                        <p>—Are there dangers of intervening against a military coup that might
                            bring to power moderate nationalist elements that we would be able to
                            work with just as well as the present regime? Is a coup group bound to
                            be radical and anti-American?</p>
                        <p>—While Jordanian intervention is probably the most politically viable in
                            any future crisis, if Jordan alone is unable to reverse the <pb
                                facs="0109" n="74" xml:id="pg_74"/> situation, would it be
                            preferable for the US or Iran to act then? Granted that there would be
                            drawbacks to either US or Iranian action in terms of branding the
                            elements we help as traitors or puppets, would Iran’s intervention cause
                            fewer problems than our own? Could Iran both deter Iraq and intervene
                            directly? Would the Soviets exert pressure on Iran in these
                            circumstances?</p>

                            terms of more aid to sustain Jordanian operations in a future Saudi

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: The Shah wants to
                            ride in an F–14 while he is here. It’s operational now, and he has
                            indicated he wants to buy a squadron of F–14s and F–15s at some
                            point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you not want
                            him to fly? I’ll call their Ambassador and tell him that we would feel
                            better if he did not fly in a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Government aircraft while he is in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: No, I don’t want you
                            to. He really wants to fly it. He is a professional—he’s no kid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Ken (<persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: I don’t think he should
                            fly in any <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military plane while he
                            is here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Dick (<persName

                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: The Crown Prince is
                            only 13 years old.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If he wants the
                            aircraft he will buy it whether he flies it or not. He’s not a child;
                            he’s a highly intelligent, cold-blooded, calculating, tough man. I can
                            call his Ambassador and say the President is worried about his flying in
                            this plane. It can be done so that it flatters him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: I agree that it should
                            be done as you describe. I recommend you make the call.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hill: What if he comes back and says he still wants to fly it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, we can
                            say that if he has his heart set on it, okay. But the President would
                            feel easier if he did not have that one worry in 10,000. The Shah will
                            be flattered.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Moorer</persName>: And then he will fly
                            it. That way we get the best of both worlds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: You have to consider
                            his motivation. Not only is he interested in the weapon, but this is
                            also a great image builder for him. A demonstration of his virility.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We won’t stop him,
                            but we’ll just say our minds would be easier if he didn’t do it.</p>
                        <p>I thought we might have a follow-on today of last week’s discussion,
                            focussing on the Arabian Peninsula and the Persian Gulf, and on the
                            Saudi Arabian contingency paper which I want to discuss briefly.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Dick (Walters)</persName>, do you have
                            a briefing for us?</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName> briefed from the
                            attached text.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Joe (Sisco)</persName>, do you want to discuss the
                            State Department paper on a basic approach?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: This paper tries to
                            analyze how we believe Moscow looks at the region as a whole. It
                            outlines two approaches from our point of view: 1) as a Soviet-American
                            issue which includes the element of détente in Europe; and 2) the area
                            viewed as a whole but also as sub-regions in which we should consider
                            the various indigenous forces. We come out with an inevitable mixing of
                            the two strategies. There is no easy, simplistic, one-course response.
                            Our strategy could manifest itself in bilateral state-by-state
                            relations. The two strategies are not mutual exclusive. But we would
                            like to explore whether you (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>) feel, given our evolving relationships with
                            the Soviet Union and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>, that
                            there is any new kind of leverage to move from a policy of détente in
                            Europe and non-confrontation in this region—to move to active
                            cooperation to stabilize the area. We have serious doubts if the Soviets
                            want to go beyond the avoidance of war and confrontation. This situation
                            gives them an opportunity to probe for soft spots and exploit any
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m not astonished
                            by <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> activities in this area. This
                            will sort itself out—we can handle it. With regard to the active
                            cooperation of the Soviets, it would be difficult to obtain in Moscow
                            and it might bring the Chinese in in a more active way. I believe the
                            Soviets would go along with non-confrontation, but it depends on the
                            definition of non-confrontation. The problem is whether the objectives
                            of Soviet policy can work adversely to our interests. If there should be
                            a successful Iraqi association with the Soviet Union, we could get the
                            evolution General <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>

                            meeting on <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 182, July 13, 1973).
                            If non-confrontation makes the friends of the Soviet Union pay a heavy
                            price for that friendship and strengthens the countries which are
                            supporting stability in the area, then it is in our interest.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: We have some real
                            assets in various places.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We should be
                            careful not to draw the Israelis in. We don’t have to pay any additional
                            price for their being strong.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: That makes a great deal
                            of sense. We can continue our support to Iran and Jordan but keep the
                            door open to Iraq and Syria.</p>
                        <pb facs="0113" n="78" xml:id="pg_78"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But make them pay
                            a price. Keeping the Kurds active in Iraq would not be contrary to our
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: Not at all—it would be
                            helpful. With regard to the Aden regime in South Yemen, Saudi Arabian
                            equipment is now going into North Yemen, and we hope Jordan will help
                            too. Jordan, Iran and others are involved in Oman, where there is a
                            Dofar rebellion supported by the Soviets. They’re paying a price. We’re
                            doing it by stimulating our regional partners. Of course, there is an
                            incremental element. We have to do something to sweeten the pot to get
                            them to move. I was struck by the statement of an Iraqi leader three
                            days ago in which he said he would welcome an opportunity to talk to us.
                            Our man in Baghdad has been very limited in his contacts.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Moorer</persName>: We have intelligence
                            reports indicating that the Iraqis are easing back some on their
                            involvement with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: We’re recommending a
                            quiet chat with the Iraqi man here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I got in trouble
                            when I used the word “expel” in 1969, but if we could get the Soviets to
                            suffer a mis-adventure in Iraq it could curb the Soviet appetite in the
                            Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: I wouldn’t be so modest
                            in using the word “expel”. There are signs that Iraq, as a minimum, is
                            trying to keep the door open to the West. As a maximum, they’re trying
                            to loosen their link with the Soviets. I don’t want to overdraw this
                            situation, though.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If that happens,
                            what?</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: The Iraqi
                            Government has just agreed to work more closely with the Iraqi
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: They added two members
                            to the Government, but they also talked about adding Kurdish members—a
                            tripartite arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: There are 2½ million
                            Iranians in Southern Iraq. The Shah should be encouraged to stimulate
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Every time he has
                            tried it the Iraqis have known about it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: You can’t do it
                            without some risk. He should stir the pot.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: We hope to stir the pot
                            in our direction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What should we
                            discuss with the Shah when he is here? What do we want from him?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: We may find him
                            concerned that we’re preoccupied with détente in Europe and not
                            sufficiently vigorous in recognizing and countering Soviet machinations
                            in his area. Any assurances we could give him in this regard would be
                            very desirable. We should emphasize that the Shah is a primary element
                            of stability. We can <pb facs="0114" n="79" xml:id="pg_79"/> understand
                            his exasperation and irritation with King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName>, who is dragging his feet, and we’re relying on
                            the Shah to draw out <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>
                            and move him toward greater cooperation. But, remember, power both
                            attracts and repels. <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>
                            doesn’t mind a strengthened Iran but is worried about Persian power; but
                            the Shah can deal with this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: This Shah-Saudi
                            relationship is overplayed. <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> is looking for signals from the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> He is worried that his direct
                            communication with us is not as strong as Iran’s. It’s improving and he
                            hopes in time it will be equally good. But he has serious misgivings
                            about an Iranian battalion in Oman. These cables talking about how the
                            Shah and Jordan could take over Saudi Arabia in case of a rebellion are
                            bad business.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why is it bad
                            business?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: We can get in an
                            awful jam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: The point is to stress
                            to the Shah that he should do everything he can to strengthen
                            cooperation with Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: The Shah wants an
                            alliance with <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> is torn between the
                            dangers of a leftist rebellion and being swallowed by the Shah. The Shah
                            thinks he and Saudi Arabia would be a powerful base if they could get
                            together. We could talk to the Shah in a low key about his concern that
                            we and the Soviets are doing something that might affect him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Like what?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: Something on the Persian
                            Gulf, oil in the Middle East, Pakistan. We could assure him that our
                            dealings with the Russians have nothing to do with him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: And that we are alive
                            to the Soviet threat in the area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: He thinks India and the
                            Soviet Union are anxious to foment difficulties on Baluchistan and
                            Pushtunistan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Particularly now
                            with the change in Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: Yes. He thinks India and
                            the Soviet Union want to break up Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Iran can play a
                            regional role. You could argue that it would not be in Saudi interest to
                            get it involved in this kind of foreign policy issue. It might undermine
                            the monarchy if we pushed too much. They are interested in South Yemen
                            and Oman. In the general scheme of things, maybe the best thing Saudi
                            Arabia can do is to stay alive in its present structure.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: Absolutely. They
                            have all the fish they can fry at home.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But as a concept,
                            what’s wrong with the cable? If a version of Quadhafi takes over in
                            Saudi Arabia, what do we do? Do <pb facs="0115" n="80" xml:id="pg_80"/>
                            we negotiate with him? This should be prevented. As Saudi Arabia
                            modernizes, with our help, the probability of revolution increases. If a
                            Quadhafi takes over, what course should we take?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: We don’t consider the
                            Saudi Arabian situation so precarious.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Fine. But what’s
                            wrong with the contingency planning in the cable? We’re not promoting or
                            advocating the contingency. We should try to prevent the contingency,
                            but what do we do if Radio Jidda announces a take-over by a group of
                            left-leaning Colonels?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: We should give careful
                            attention to the various contingencies.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: History doesn’t
                            wait.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: It’s not our place
                            to make history.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What does that
                            mean?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: The Shah has got the
                            big eye on the whole area. He would like nothing better than for us to
                            include him in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> contingency plans in
                            a hiatus. He will make the hiatus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Suppose he
                            doesn’t, and it occurs. What do we do?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: We should be giving
                            more attention to Saudi Arabia itself. There are many things we could do
                            to strengthen its position. The Shah is telling everyone how unstable
                            Saudi Arabia is. He’s been forecasting doom for the last five years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The problem is to
                            get our government ready for a contingency when it arises. We shouldn’t
                            make it or encourage the Shah to make it. But we want to get some basic
                            thinking on our choices, should it happen. This is a good paper.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: We tried to develop
                            honest choices. It wasn’t easy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What are the basic
                            types of approach?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: We see three
                            contingencies: 1) gradual deterioration, 2) civil war, and 3) a
                            successful coup.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would we know the
                            nature of the coup? Could we identify the possible effect on <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests in a short time?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: I’m not sure.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We really wouldn’t
                            know?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: If you ask me the worst
                            thing that could happen, it would be a take-over by radical elements
                            without any prior knowledge. Our options would be 1) American
                            intervention, where the difficulties are obvious; 2) consultations with
                            the Shah on the contingencies: if it occurred, what would you be willing
                            to do? what is your capacity? what prior preparation would be required?
                            and 3) involvement of Jordan in the discussions. But how would we
                            prevent it from leaking? It would be compared to the 1956
                            French-British-Israel collusion. There <pb facs="0116" n="81"
                                xml:id="pg_81"/> would be charges of a <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We can do
                            contingency planning in two ways: 1) what do we want to promote and what
                            assets do we have, without discussing it with others; and 2) planning
                            which includes others. If Jordan might play a role, we should keep this
                            in mind in our arms policy, without telling the King of Jordan about it.
                            He’s no fool.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: I agree. If we start
                            on that track he’ll be three jumps ahead of us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The King of Jordan
                            couldn’t take on Saudi Arabia without overwhelming problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: Syria and Iraq would
                            jump in. Then Israel might. How could we contain such intervention
                            without it’s spreading and involving all of the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We wouldn’t give a
                            damn about Saudi Arabia if it didn’t have most of the oil in the region.
                            The question is what we should do if two years from now we find
                            ourselves dealing with a Quadhafi.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: Could we really consider
                            a military option?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is damned
                            serious. Some problems are so essential to our survival that we have to
                            consider it seriously.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: I agree, we have to
                            consider it seriously. But I haven’t even seen the paper yet.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: You have had the paper
                            since it was finished. But we had a very short fuse on this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>) It’s the paper I showed you
                            yesterday. I put it in your briefing book.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s our fault for
                            the short fuse on this. But we wanted to have something if it were
                            raised by the Shah. I see a problem about <hi rend="italic"
                                >discussing</hi> it with the Shah—it might whet his appetite.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the general strategy, the paper lays out not so much
                            alternative directions but alternative emphasis. We could do anything
                            under either alternative. Assuming we don’t want a confrontation with
                            the Soviets but that we want to make things difficult for them and help
                            our friends, what should we do? <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Bill
                                Clements</persName> has spelled out what he wants to do for Saudi
                            Arabia. What should we do if one of the key countries, like Saudi
                            Arabia, starts collapsing? The three alternatives are good, but can we
                            spell them out in more detail? What would we do?</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: Plus preventive
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: We can do a little
                            better.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is enough
                            here to prepare the President for his talks with the Shah. We should not
                                <hi rend="italic">discuss</hi> this with the Shah. But <pb
                                facs="0117" n="82" xml:id="pg_82"/> we should get this spelled out
                            both in terms of overall strategy and in the contingency sense. Let’s do
                            the same thing for the Emirates. What would we do in a contingency, if
                            anything?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: We should consider
                            their vulnerability. The Shah wants an unstable situation here. If there
                            were trouble, he’d be in in five minutes. There are strained relations
                            between some of these rulers and Iran.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: Iranian military
                            intervention in the Peninsula would arouse the Arab world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Could Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Moorer</persName> and Defense include
                            some thinking on the role of a naval presence as we evolve a
                            strategy.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Moorer</persName>: We might beef it up
                            some.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Dick (<persName
                                corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>), you have a look of
                            doubt?</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>: In any paper on the
                            United Arab Emirates, you have such a disparity of conditions, dynastic
                            rivalries, their childish displays with Saudi Arabia over infinitesimal
                            areas of territory.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But what
                            developments there might threaten our interests? Let’s try to identify
                            them and know what we would do.</p>
                        <p>On another matter, I’ve heard complaints about our representation
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_HRM_1">Dick Helms</persName> says our representation is
                            too low; that we’re hurt by not having Ambassadors there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How about the
                            quality?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: It’s both titles and
                            quality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: We’ve recommended
                            upgrading our representation, but it’s a Congressional problem.
                            Fulbright is against it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are we short in
                            Saudi Arabia too?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: We’re short of
                            people and quality—State [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] and the military are in the same boat. We’re
                            short of budget and equipment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: I agree.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s include
                            considerations such as these.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>: Can State transfer
                            people from one area to another with a higher priority?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName>: Yes, we do it all the
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: The response to <gloss

                        <p>1. (S) The recent Middle East war and its aftermath clearly demonstrated
                            the vital nature of oil to the United States and its allies. The
                            effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, freedom of the
                            United States and its allies from coercion, and US relations with its
                            allies can depend on sustained access to this resource.</p>
                        <p>2. (S) An initial assessment of US interests in the Middle East/Indian
                            Ocean area indicates that continued access to vital regional resources
                            may depend upon the ability of the United States to communicate
                            effectively an unmistakable resolve to oppose threats to regional
                            stability which would impact on vital regional interests. US efforts to
                            promote stability in the region hinge upon the development of a
                            relationship of mutual respect between countries of the region and the
                            United States. Arab nations should be provided an alternate to the
                            presence and assistance of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.
                            On the military’s side this can be done by insuring that current and
                            future assistance efforts of military assistance and advisory groups,
                            Defense Attachés, and military opera<pb facs="0119" n="84"
                                xml:id="pg_84"/>tion and support projects—e.g., engineers, training,
                            and technical assistance teams—are carried out in a high quality,
                            professional manner. Personnel exchange programs and orientation tours
                            by all the Services should also be increased and given a high priority.
                            Furthermore, the United States must develop the capability to establish
                            a regional military force presence when and if required to promote
                            stability.</p>
                        <p>3. (U) A detailed study of this problem is underway. It will provide a
                            detailed examination of US national security interests and objectives

                        <p>4. (S) The initial assessment identified certain general facility
                            requirements for the region. The extended leadtime required to complete
                            the various negotiations indicates that the recommendations of the
                            initial assessment should serve as a basis for preliminary diplomatic
                            initiatives.</p>
                        <p>5. (S) Additional contingency planning in furtherance of US strategy for
                            the Middle East is being prepared which encompasses capabilities which
                            support operations in that area from the <gloss target="#t_USEUCOM_1"
                                >USEUCOM</gloss> area. These contingencies will require base and
                            operating rights in Turkey, Greece, and Italy. This requirement will be
                            the subject of a subsequent memorandum.</p>
                        <p>6. (U) The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that a memorandum,
                            substantially the same as that contained in the Appendix hereto,
                            together with its Annex, be forwarded to the Secretary of State.</p>

                        <p>This Estimate focuses primarily on the major economic and military
                            implications of the prospective reopening of the Suez Canal. It is not
                            intended as a comprehensive study of all the ramifications, but rather
                            concentrates on those economic and military aspects felt to be of
                            greatest importance for US decision-making in the short term. For the
                            purposes of the estimate, the Indian Ocean includes the Persian Gulf and
                            Red Sea. The economic judgments in this <gloss target="#t_SNIE_1"
                                >SNIE</gloss> are based on an assumption that the Canal will be
                            opened by the end of this year. It is estimated that it will take at
                            least six months to clear the Canal of mines and obstructions and
                            restore it to its 1967 condition.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The prospective reopening of the Suez Canal has significant military and
                            economic implications for the Middle East region, the broader Indian
                            Ocean area, and for outside powers with major interests in the area. In
                            most respects, the world has adjusted to and compensated for the Canal’s
                            closure since June 1967. The economic and military consequences of this
                            process, however, have had an uneven impact on the concerned countries,
                            and so will the Canal’s reopening.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Implications</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">In economic terms the reopening of the Suez Canal will
                                not result in a return to the situation that obtained at the time of
                                the Canal’s closure.</hi> But to varying degrees consumers and
                            producers around the world will benefit some from use of the Canal, with
                            only shipowners and shipbuilders being injured. More specifically:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—Reopening the Suez Canal will have only a moderate economic impact
                                because alternative shipping arrangements have been developed since
                                its closing in 1967. Given the increased use of cost-efficient
                                supertankers too large to transit Suez, most Middle East oil traffic
                                will continue to take the longer Cape route to major Western
                                markets. Prior to 1967, oil shipments comprised some three-fourths
                                of Canal traffic. Most dry cargo traffic will be attracted back to
                                the Canal, however, and the volume of this trade could be half again
                                as large as in 1966. Total traffic through Suez thus should measure
                                some two-thirds of its pre-closure rate.</p>
                            <p>—Shorter voyage times for trade moving via the Canal will reduce the
                                number of ships needed to carry world trade, at least temporarily
                                reducing world shipping rates and slowing shipbuilding orders. Even
                                with the Canal closed, demand for shipping is expected to slacken
                                during the next year or so because of a slowdown in world trade and
                                output.</p>
                            <p>—The direct economic <hi rend="italic">impact on the US will be
                                    beneficial but small.</hi> Shorter hauls will reduce transport
                                costs for oil and other raw material imports from regions east of
                                Suez and lower worldwide rates will reduce US shipping payments even
                                more.</p>
                            <p>—The net gain for Western Europe and Japan will be reduced by losses
                                in shipping income and in shipbuilding orders.</p>
                            <p>—The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will benefit
                                substantially because, among other things, Soviet merchant ships are
                                small enough to transit the Canal fully loaded.</p>
                            <p>—Egypt stands to gain most from a reopened Canal. At a minimum, it
                                could earn an additional $145 million annually in foreign exchange
                                unless other Arab states reduce their subsidies. Israel will gain
                                little economically from a reopened Canal.</p>
                            <p>—Other Middle East states—like the Peoples Democratic Republic of
                                Yemen and Sudan—will gain some port revenues, while nations along
                                the Cape route will suffer a small decline. South Asian and East
                                African less-developed countries will benefit from reduced shipping
                                charges on their trade with Europe, and their export earnings will
                                be boosted moderately.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is a basic judgment of this estimate that <hi rend="italic">the
                                reopening of the Suez Canal will significantly increase naval
                                flexibility but will not by itself precipitate a major change in the
                                size of the Soviet naval presence in the Indian Ocean.</hi> Use of
                            the Canal would give the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> easier
                            and more timely naval access to the western Indian Ocean, but not the
                            incentive to suddenly increase its naval force there on a permanent
                            basis. A reopened Canal would expedite inter-fleet transfers, deliveries
                            of military aid and logistic support of ships in the Indian Ocean. It
                            would remove the current US geographic advantage for surge deployments
                            into the area. Moreover, the Soviets would be able to replace surface
                            ships drawn from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean more quickly than
                            the US.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets would like to play a greater role in the Indian Ocean. They
                            probably expect considerable political change over the next decade in
                            the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia, and the Horn of Africa and would like to
                            be in a position to influence and profit from such changes. The Soviets
                            will use a naval presence as one element in a combined approach which
                            utilizes political, economic, subversive, and military aid instruments
                            as well.<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">Several <gloss target="#t_USIB_1"
                                    >USIB</gloss> members believe that the above understates the
                                degree of importance of the Soviet naval presence in the Indian
                                Ocean, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea. For their views see footnote to
                                paragraph 26. [Footnote is in the original.]</note> In contemplating
                            an expanded naval presence the Soviets will be conscious of a number of
                            risks. These include possible future ejection from local shore
                            facilities and excessive involvement with one partly to a regional
                            rivalry.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not the Suez Canal is reopened the Soviet Union is likely to
                            increase its continuous deployments in the Indian Ocean, if there is no
                            substantial increase in US naval forces in the area, this increase is
                            likely to be gradual leading to a continuously deployed force of, say,
                            8–12 surface combatants in 1976 or 1977. The Soviets can be expected to
                            probe for and test in a measured way the tolerance of the US and the
                            major littoral states. With the Canal open, they could also test the

                        <p>I attach an initial study report on the development of new programs of
                            cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia, as called for by
                                <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 198. This report represents
                            the views and recommendations of the Interdepartmental Working Group
                            which I chair. It defines our broad interest and objectives, identifies
                            issues in the economic, technological and security fields, and lays out
                            a strategy for engaging the Saudis on them.</p>
                        <p>While we foresee numerous subjects of interest to both sides that can
                            provide considerable substance to our cooperation, we should approach
                            the Saudis with an open mind in developing our new relationship. We will
                            have to avoid giving the impression that we have our own firm blueprint,
                            and make it clear we want to listen to them on things they consider
                            important.</p>
                        <pb facs="0125" n="90" xml:id="pg_90"/>
                        <p>Our report proposes the formation of two joint commissions: one on
                            Economic Cooperation (chaired on our side by the Secretary of the
                            Treasury) and one on Security Cooperation (under the Deputy Secretary of
                            Defense). They would operate subject to my day-to-day political guidance
                            and coordination, under your direction. (We suggested previously to the
                            Saudis that there could also be a Joint Commission on Science and
                            Technology, but it appears to us now that the work of such a Commission
                            would be quite thin and that it would be better to fold it into the
                            Economic Commission.) Working Groups would deal with the substantive
                            issues between sessions of each Commission.</p>
                        <p>We are well launched with the Saudis. We now have the basis for your
                            discussions when you visit Riyadh later this month, at which time the
                            agenda for Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s visit
                            to Washington in May might be fixed. Out of <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s visit should come a more
                            detailed understanding of how we will proceed, leading possibly to an
                            early visit to Saudi Arabia by a United States team and the first
                            meeting of each of the Joint Commissions shortly thereafter.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> staff work is under way
                            to prepare for initial working discussions with the Saudis in both the

                        <p>US–<gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> consultations on the Gulf centered
                            around the following subjects, proposed by the British: oil, military
                            assistance and sales, Iranian initiatives and intentions vis-à-vis the
                            Gulf and Indian Ocean, Saudi Arabia, the military situation in Oman and
                            prospects for settling the Dhofar conflict, and the two Yemens. The
                            talks revealed no changes of policy on either side, or policy
                            differences. The <gloss target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> expects that the
                            present defense budget review being conducted by the new Labor
                            Government will not result in any significant cuts in its presence in
                            Oman or the Gulf. Iran has expressed an interest to both the US and
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> in buying sea control ships. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>’s answer will depend on the
                            defense budget review. Iran plans to station 16 F–5’s in Oman, beginning
                            with 4 this fall on Masirah until an airstrip in Dhofar is paved for the
                            planes. Iran will also add 1000 troops this fall to the 1200 it
                            presently has in Dhofar. Although the British did not feel that Iran
                            intends to establish a permanent military presence in Oman, they doubted
                            that Iran’s military involvement will be as “temporary” as initially
                            envisaged. Sudan may supply a battalion of troops to Oman. The British
                            believe the activity of the Arab League Conciliation Committee for
                            Dhofar has helped Oman and hurt <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>.
                            British proposals for cooperation with Saudi Arabia are similar to ours.
                            The British are skeptical about any benefits to be gained from providing
                            assistance to <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> so long as <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> supports insurgency in Dhofar. On
                                <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, they prefer the stick to the
                            carrot approach. <hi rend="italic">End Summary</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP_1">Davies</persName> opened by welcoming
                            his British colleagues and noted it was a pleasure as always to see
                            them. He said that, although during twelve years of <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>
                            Middle East talks attention had centered in the Levant, those of us
                            interested in the Gulf had seen this latter area accorded a dramatic
                            rise in importance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP_1">Davies</persName> continued by stating
                            his understanding that <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> was
                            interested in learning if there had been any change in US policies
                            towards the Gulf since the two governments’ discussions last September,
                            or whether there was any change in the emphasis of policies remaining in
                            effect. He assured the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>
                            representatives that there had been no change and that we continue to
                            see Saudi Arabia and Iran as the keys to regional stability with Great
                            Britain, whose interests parallel <pb facs="0127" n="92" xml:id="pg_92"
                            /> our own, maintaining a position of special importance in the area.
                            Nevertheless, given the Gulf’s increased economic-strategic significance
                            and the fact that our relations are becoming more important, we are
                            willing now to play a more active role there in supporting regional
                            cooperation. We still do not wish to become directly involved as a
                            go-between in the settling of disputes which we feel the parties
                            themselves should work out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir reciprocated Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP_1">Davies</persName>’
                            pleasure at the chance to see his colleagues and to take stock of the
                            Gulf situation. He noted that, although he was no stranger to these
                            sessions, he had participated last year simply as a spectator and that
                            it had been three years since he had had first hand experience in Gulf
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>In general, Mr. Weir continued, <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> does
                            wish to know if the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has changed or
                            contemplates changing any of its Gulf policies. Conversely, he said, one
                            could ask the same question of the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>.
                            London is in the midst of a defense policy review. This is still going
                            on, but its implications will be discussed with all affected parties.
                            Although Britain withdrew from the Gulf in 1971, it has retained a
                            special position there. British seconded officers are serving with
                            several Gulf states, and Mr. Weir said, they represent to those states a
                            very good value for services rendered. He expressed the personal
                            hope—but with conviction—that the defense review would not cause any
                            major changes in the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>’s current Gulf
                            policy. Mr. Weir said he looked forward to getting into the specifics of
                            today’s agenda, as <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss>’s chiefs of
                            Middle East missions, under Minister Callaghan’s direction, had just
                            completed a one week review of the full range of <gloss target="#t_UK_2"
                                >UK</gloss> policies in that part of the world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> outlined an approach
                            to the agenda which would initially handle those items relating to oil,
                            military assistance, Iranian initiatives, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the
                            two Yemens. Subsequently, remaining items could be covered as time
                            permitted.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Petroleum</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP_1">Davies</persName>, assisted by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> and Mr. Mau, gave a
                            detailed exposition of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> views
                            regarding the current status of Gulf area oil problems, viz: (1) Aramco
                            parent company participation talks with the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss>, (2) the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> attitude
                            toward participation in general, and (3) the balancing of producer and
                            consumer interests, given not only the new era of participation but also
                            the probably more difficult problem of controlling prices.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir asked if the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agreed that
                            Saudi Arabia was the key to the oil situation, and agreement was
                            unanimous. Weir also asked, now that Kuwait’s National Assembly has
                            ratified a 60/40 participation split with Gulf and <gloss
                                target="#t_BP_1">BP</gloss>, if the Saudis had made moves to alter
                            their 25 <pb facs="0128" n="93" xml:id="pg_93"/> percent arrangement
                            with Aramco. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName>
                            answered that to our knowledge this was not the case, although Aramco
                            had explained its willingness to tackle this subject at any time the
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> wished to do so. Weir wondered
                            whether the Saudis might be trying to influence the participation and
                            price situation in Kuwait. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                                >Dickman</persName> said they were certainly watching events closely
                            and had sent official representatives to Kuwait to be briefed on
                            progress, but he doubted any direct Saudi effort to force a specific
                            outcome. Mr. Mau and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName>
                            replied in the affirmative to Weir’s question asking if it was true that
                            buy-back price negotiations had gotten off with the Kuwaitis seeking 98
                            percent of posted price. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                                >Dickman</persName> noted that <gloss target="#t_FEO_1">FEO</gloss>
                            Director Sawhill had spoken with Gulf Oil Corporation Chairman Dorsey
                            and explicitly sought to have Gulf hold out for less than 93 percent of
                            posted price in these negotiations, even though 93 percent for the first
                            six months of 1974 seems unavoidable. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> is not overjoyed at these prospects, he added. Mr. Weir
                            said his Government was equally concerned, and although not directly
                            involved yet, would be démarching to Ateeqi on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir noted that Saudi Minister <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1"
                                >Yamani</persName>, when in London earlier this month, spoke
                            cryptically of a “major effort to get oil prices down.” He asked if
                            there was any substance to this comment. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> replied that we did not yet
                            know whether <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> was talking
                            specifically of increasing production or whether his reference was to
                            steps the Saudis would take unilaterally to reduce their oil prices. We
                            are not aware that the Saudis have really made up their minds on the
                            production/price question, <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                                >Dickman</persName> said, and added that King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> was worried about high prices
                            and that it was the King, and not <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1"
                                >Yamani</persName>, who would make the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss>’s decision on this issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mau mentioned our recent talks with Nigeria’s Petroleum Minister in
                            which the latter was of the opinion that <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> would surely cut production before letting prices go
                            down. Also, he said, Exxon has told the Japanese it will have trouble
                            supplying the Japanese market as a result of having lost control of
                            virtually all of its royalty oil. Mau reasoned that it would currently
                            be very difficult to say whether or not there would be downward
                            pressures on oil prices. Mr. Weir raised the question that if other
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> states met any large Saudi
                            production increases with countering decreases, could perhaps the Saudi
                            action be rendered indecisive? Mr. Wright noted that Iran was becoming
                            progressively more worried about conservation, and that if the Shah
                            moved decisively in that direction, Saudi Arabia might not be the only
                            key to oil supply and price questions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP_1">Davies</persName> asked if combined
                            Third World pressure might not be an effective tool against production
                            cuts and artificial high prices, but Mr. Weir responded that one after
                            another of the <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s seemed to <pb
                                facs="0129" n="94" xml:id="pg_94"/> have been bought-off by special
                            deals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName>, however,
                            maintained that as time passes, and the depressive effect of high oil
                            prices are felt, Third World pressure will mount and oil producing
                            states will feel it. Mr. Mau noted the opinion currently prominent
                            within the industry that there will soon be excess production
                            capacity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir asked just what <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName>
                            meant by “low price”—$10.50 per barrel? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                                >Dickman</persName> responded that an appropriate low price would be
                            a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> landed cost of $7.00 per barrel,
                            but that <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName>’s thoughts
                            probably did not project that far down. Whatever level the Saudis might
                            be thinking about, a huge balance of payments surplus would remain to
                            the producing countries. Mr. Wright remarked humorously that the
                            producers were apparently not out to “solve their surplus problem,” and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> said that if one
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> member eased up on price, the
                            others would probably work hard to push the price back up again. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DRP_1">Davies</persName> said we don’t know
                            how <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> stands vis-à-vis his
                            Government; Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> could
                            have told us, but he has not arrived here yet. Mr. Weir then said “We
                            seem to have agreed to wring our hands.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRP_1">Davies</persName> stressed his view that
                            the Energy Coordinating Group was the best mechanism for dealing with
                            problems of this sort, but Mr. Weir reported that <persName
                                corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> had given <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> a firm “no” with respect to such
                            coordination, except possibly within the framework of a “mini-group”—and
                            he was indecisive even on this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                                >Dickman</persName> suggested that perhaps a “group of ten” might be
                            acceptable. He asked whether his British colleagues had any specific
                            ideas on this score, and Mr. Wright replied that he did not think they
                            did at the moment.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Assistance and Arms Sales</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to military assistance and arms sales
                            policies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> summarized
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> views that (1) in the Lower
                            Gulf, our arms sale policy should be directly related to the internal
                            security needs of the states of the area and should avoid the
                            introduction of weapons which could have a destabilizing effect; (2) our
                            arms sales in Oman are complementary to and not competitive with the
                            British; (3) although interrupted by the October 73 war, we hope to
                            complete transfer of $2.6 million worth of small arms and ammunition to
                            the Yemen Arab Republic, which will be financed by Abu Dhabi; (4) we
                            believe it would be beneficial for Saudi Arabia or Abu Dhabi to finance
                            Jordanian military training and advisory assistance to the <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>; (5) although we do not intend to
                            become directly involved, we look forward to engaging Saudi Arabia in
                            plans for the long-term rearmament of the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss>; and (6) we did not believe that the Saudis’ agreement
                            to reimburse Egypt for the transfer to the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> of $80 million in Soviet military equipment indicates a
                            Saudi desire to continue the <pb facs="0130" n="95" xml:id="pg_95"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>’s dependence on Soviet Arms.
                            Rather, it is an interim measure pending steps to slowly reorient the
                                <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> to a western arms
                            inventory.</p>
                        <p>Responding to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName>’s
                            presentation on US arms sales policy, Mr. Weir said that <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss>’s policies were in agreement and had
                            not changed since we discussed them last summer. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> shares our desire to avoid a direct
                            military role and does not want to crimp the US style in any way other
                            than normal competition. Mr. Weir said he noted that policy on arms
                            sales to the Middle East had been a hot issue during the October war.
                            The new Labor Government had taken a fresh look at arms sales policy.
                            Less than two weeks ago it reached a decision which essentially
                            coincided with the policy of the previous government prior to the
                            October war. That is, that <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> is
                            prepared to consider requests for arms so long as these do not hinder
                            the prospects for a lasting peace in the Middle East. Weir said that
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> did not plan to make any
                            announcement of this decision but was privately informing the various
                            governments concerned. Its net effect would be to permit a resumption of
                            British arms sales to the area.</p>
                        <p>Weir remarked that resumption of <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> arms
                            sales was unlikely to include significant sales to either Libya or Iraq,
                            countries which in any event had not expressed interest in significant
                            purchases. In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1"
                                >Sober</persName>’s question, Mr. Weir said that he could not think
                            of any inhibitions regarding <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> arms
                            sales to Iran. In response to Mr. Weir’s question about US arms sales to
                            Kuwait, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> said that up
                            to the present we had sold only 20 million dollars worth. Almost all our
                            letters of offer of last year had expired. Our impression was that US
                            aircraft were out of the running. However, the Kuwaitis were still
                            interested in the advanced Hawk. Weir said that there were no major
                            deals pending with the Kuwaitis, although they had expressed interest in
                            tanks and aircraft. Although there was talk of Kuwait’s purchasing
                            Mirages, the British hoped that the Kuwaitis were still interested in
                            purchasing Jaguar aircraft as well as Chieftain tanks. Mr. Wright noted
                            that George Lambrakis of our Embassy London had reported that the
                            Kuwaitis had expressed disappointment at the slow delivery times from
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and asked if the Kuwaitis
                            planned to procure arms from the Soviet Union. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> remarked that Kuwait’s
                            dealings with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> on arms might
                            be for purchases for third countries such as Syria rather than for
                            Kuwait itself. Also, the Kuwait Defense Minister’s trip to Moscow
                            appeared to be primarily a public relations exercise so that when and if
                            Kuwait decided to buy weapons from western countries, radical members of
                            Kuwait’s parliament could not accuse the Ministry of not having looked
                            into all possible sources of supply. Mr. Weir agreed with this
                            analysis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir asked about present US policy regarding sale of “blowpipe” type
                            hand-held rocket launchers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                                >Dickman</persName> replied that the <pb facs="0131" n="96"
                                xml:id="pg_96"/> US was concerned that should sales of these weapons
                            be made to Arab countries, they might wind up in the hands of
                            terrorists. It was for this reason that we had expressed our concern to
                            the British regarding possible <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> sales
                            of such equipment to Arab countries. Mr. Weir replied that they had
                            received no expression of interest from Arab states about these weapons.
                            Mr. Weir remarked that there was presently intense competition to sell
                            missiles to Abu Dhabi. The <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> was
                            pushing the Rapier and the French the Crotale.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir asked if there were any new developments in US arms sales to
                            Saudi Arabia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName>
                            replied that there were no significant developments. In April the Saudis
                            had signed a letter of offer for equipping and training the National
                            Guard. The published figures about this deal were incorrect. We did not
                            have a clear idea of how much it would cost since it would extend over
                            5½ years. As for aircraft, Phantoms appeared to be out of the running
                            but no firm decisions had been reached. The Saudis apparently had
                            purchased Mirages but these would not be for their use. The main
                            constraints to arms sales continue to be Saudi Arabia’s limitations in
                            manpower and management. Mr. Weir said that as far as British programs
                            were concerned, these were now going well. The Lightnings’ problems have
                            been solved and the British have been able to keep personnel within
                            manpower ceilings. However there were still a few financial
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir said the Shah had hopes of purchasing through-deck cruisers from
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>. These were essentially small
                            aircraft carriers. The problem, Weir said, was that these carriers do
                            not yet exist. Whether they are built will depend entirely on the Labor
                            Government’s current budgetary review of defense expenditures. The Shah
                            indicated that he will only buy ships which have been tested and used by
                            HM’s Navy, yet he is pressing for their early delivery. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> said that the Shah had come to us
                            with a similar request for what we call a sea control ship. He wishes to
                            acquire the capability to operate well into the Indian Ocean with large
                            destroyers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> said that
                            we really had not yet had time to focus on this request. There might be
                            some practical problems, because purchase of these vessels would require
                            a quantum jump in Iran’s naval complement. There is some question
                            whether she has the manpower to handle this increase. Mr. Morton noted
                            that as with the British, the ship the Shah asked for has not been built
                            yet.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Weir said that the grand total of official non-embassy British
                            personnel in the Gulf and Oman came to 1,958. He stressed that the
                            figures for Oman were very sensitive; <gloss target="#t_HMG_1"
                                >HMG</gloss> would not like them to appear in public. In response to

                            provided such detail about its presence in Oman.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir noted that the Labor Government was presently conducting a
                            worldwide budgetary defense review designed to cut <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> spending down to a percentage of <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> more aligned with that of other <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> countries. He was optimistic, however,
                            that this would not result in significant cuts in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> presence in the Gulf because most
                            British personnel in the Gulf were not paid for by <gloss

                        <p>In response to Mr. Weir’s question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1"
                                >Sober</persName> said that we had no plans for military
                            representation in the Gulf. Our temporary military sales mission in
                            Kuwait was generating a push for a more permanent military presence
                            there, but we in the Department have resisted this. We did not believe
                            that if <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> left Bahrain
                            this would necessarily lead to an increased US military presence
                            elsewhere in the Gulf. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                                >Dickman</persName> noted that we had recently assigned a military
                            attaché to Sanaa but this did not signify any basic change in
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> noted that while Saudi
                            Arabia and Iran formed the keystone for area stability, mutual
                            cooperation between these two states was not progressing in a
                            satisfactory manner. They do not agree on oil prices, and when the Shah
                            offers cooperative developmental lending schemes, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> does not respond. Mr. Wright
                            said the Iranians were taken aback by Saudi slowness—particularly in
                            view of the rapidity of their own responses when the Shah decided upon a
                            course of action.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Iranian Initiatives in the Gulf</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> asked if <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> could provide any information on
                            current Iranian military activities in Oman, noting that some fairly
                            heavy equipment was apparently being moved into the area. Mr. Weir
                            emphasized the Shah’s abiding interest in the security of the Straits of
                            Hormuz and in making Iran into an Indian Ocean power, but added that he
                            did not believe that the Shah wished to set himself up permanently on
                            the western shore of the Gulf. However, it was obvious from <persName
                                corresp="#p_KAA_1">Khalatbari</persName>’s remarks in the <gloss
                                target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss> meeting, May 22, that the Shah
                            made an exception of Oman, given its extreme strategic importance to
                            Iran. The <gloss target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> had initially been
                            somewhat concerned that the Shah did not inform them of the arrangements
                            he had made with Qabus and about which they had learned through other
                            sources. However, they had now had productive discussions with Iran. The
                            Omanis, Weir said, have asked the Iranians for F–5’s, not Phantoms.
                            While in London recently, Omani Foreign Minister Zawawi requested <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> permission for Iran’s using the <gloss
                                target="#t_RAF_1">RAF</gloss> air strip at Masirah to station four
                            F–5’s beginning this fall, while the dirt air strip at Midway in Dhofar
                            is improved to handle F–5’s.</p>
                        <p>It should take a year for Midway to be made usable for F–5’s. Eventually,
                            a squadron of 16 Iranian F–5’s is envisaged for Oman, Weir said. <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> realized the likely negative Arab
                            reaction that the stationing of Iranian planes in Oman would produce,
                            but judged that the consequences of turning this request down would be
                            worse. Weir noted that the <gloss target="#t_RAF_1">RAF</gloss> base at
                            Masirah was an air strip and did not have a maintenance capability for
                            F–5’s. The influx of Iranian air craft at Masirah would probably place a
                            heavy burden on the relatively small British presence there. Also, the
                            stationing of the F–5’s might require the stationing of some American
                            personnel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> said that we
                            hoped this could be avoided. Mr. Weir said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> had been concerned some time ago that
                            Oman was about to buy Mirages but that they now had managed to postpone
                            if not eliminate Omani consideration of this overly sophisticated
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir said that the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>-seconded Omani
                            Chief of Staff, General Creasey, recently went to Tehran to discuss an
                            additional deployment of Iranian troops in Dhofar which had been
                            requested by Qabus. Creasey and the Iranian Chief of Staff, General
                            Azhari, did not entirely agree about the deployment of troops but this
                            matter was later settled by a discussion between the British Ambassador
                            and the Shah. Azhari wanted the Iranian forces to have control of the
                            whole central sector of Dhofar. The <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>
                            thought this was tricky because it was in the central sector that the
                            Sultan was carrying out most of his hearts and minds campaign. Iranian
                            troops unfortunately had a tendency to shoot anything in sight,
                            including the natives’ cattle. The Shah and the British <pb facs="0134"
                                n="99" xml:id="pg_99"/> Ambassador agreed that the troops would be
                            confined to the road between Midway and Salalah and some points east
                            rather than covering the points from the Midway/Salalah road all the way
                            west to the Hornbeam line. Weir added that there was a possibility that
                            some of the new Iranian troops would be involved west of the Hornbeam
                            line but not at Simba or near the border. The Iranians would add another
                            thousand troops to the 1200 they now have in Dhofar.</p>
                        <p>Weir said that at the <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss> meeting
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAA_1">Khalatbari</persName> had asked to see
                            Callahan to express the Shah’s anxiety over reports that political
                            pressures from the left wing of the Labor party might lead to a
                            reduction in the British presence in Oman. Weir said that Callahan told
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAA_1">Khalatbari</persName> he could forget
                            about this problem. <persName corresp="#p_KAA_1">Khalatbari</persName>
                            told Callahan that the Shah was very anxious to have a quick end to the
                            Dhofar war. Weir commented that in <gloss target="#t_HMG_1"
                            >HMG</gloss>’s view, it would be almost impossible to completely
                            eliminate the rebel presence from the area between the Hornbeam line and
                            the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> border so long as <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> could send supplies across the
                            border and offer the rebels safe haven. He added that the Shah probably
                            wanted to end the war quickly to avoid Arab criticism. Foreign Minister
                            Zawawi had come back from a recent trip with a too glib view that the
                            Arabs would not object to a dramatically increased Iranian presence in
                            Oman.</p>
                        <p>Weir noted that one way around this problem was to increase the Arab
                            contribution to the Sultan’s war effort. The Sudan had offered to supply
                            a battalion of troops to Oman; a Sudanese military mission was presently
                            in Muscat discussing the possibility with the Omanis. Weir commented
                            that surprisingly enough the Saudis had recently raised with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> Ambassador in Jidda their concern that
                            the new Labor Government would change policy and withdraw British troops
                            from Oman. The Saudis said they hoped this would not be the case. They
                            added that it would be difficult for them to send troops to Oman because
                            it could arouse Arab suspicions of Saudi Arabia’s playing an
                            “imperialist” role in the southern part of the Peninsula.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName>’s
                            question, Mr. Weir confirmed that rebel activity in Dhofar had been
                            relatively low. He guessed that this was largely because rebel supplies
                            had been severely cut. He estimated the present number of rebels to be
                            about 500. Mr. Weir doubted that Iran’s increased presence in Dhofar
                            would goad the Saudis to do something. Rather, the Saudis would probably
                            repeat their argument that they did not want to become involved for fear
                            of being called imperialists. Mr. Weir estimated that even though the
                            number of rebels was small, given the topography of western Dhofar, it
                            would be very difficult to eliminate them. Even if the rebels were
                            suppressed, he wondered whether the Iranians would leave quickly since
                            the Shah might well wish to maintain a military presence in Oman.</p>
                        <pb facs="0135" n="100" xml:id="pg_100"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> asked about Oman’s
                            air defense requirements. The US had turned down an Omani request to do
                            an air defense survey, since the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> had
                            already done one and concluded that the cost and the manpower
                            requirements of a sophisticated air defense system were well beyond
                            Oman’s capability. However, we now understood that <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> was offering to sell to Oman air
                            defense equipment and radar. Weir replied that the Sultan’s request for
                            an air defense system dated back to over a year ago when the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> sent a preliminary mission to study
                            Oman’s air defense needs. The mission had come out against a full air
                            defense system but recommended that if the Sultan really pushed for some
                            air defense, the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> should propose a
                            limited scheme including mobile radar. At that time two constraints were
                            paramount in British eyes: (1) Oman’s financial position. Oman was
                            spending too much on defense, over half its budget. (2) Manpower—any
                            sophisticated air defense system would require considerable foreign
                            expertise; <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> would be reluctant to
                            have a significant increase in British manpower in Dhofar because of
                            possible parliamentary criticism. Weir noted that with the vastly
                            increased oil revenues the financial constraint had been eliminated.
                            Oman’s 1974 budget called for £72 million for defense, but this was only
                            a quarter of the £275 million expenditure envisaged.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Weir said the Committee’s visit to Oman had gone well. Its formation
                            was basically helpful to Oman. <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>
                            was unhappy about it. The Committee had asked the Sultan for permission
                            to visit Dhofar. Qabus had replied he would welcome its visit if it also
                            could visit Hauf, the main guerrilla staging point in <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>. Wright added that the fact that
                            Oman had received the Committee and <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> had not was a plus for Oman. Generally, Oman seemed to
                            be doing fairly well in an Arab context. Omani Foreign Minister Zawawi
                            had told the British that Boumediene had been very sympathetic to his
                            presentation on Dhofar. Now even Libya had offered to send officers to
                            Dhofar but the Sultan was leery of this, given the Iranian presence
                            there.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">US-Saudi Relationship</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> explained that although
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s visit to
                            Washington is temporarily postponed, it could well be rescheduled within
                            the next ten days. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName>
                            stressed (1) that talks with the Saudis are not aimed at setting up a
                            bilateral oil deal, but rather to re-emphasize the continued importance
                            the two countries attach to their long-standing policies of close
                            bilateral cooperation, and (2) that the initial objectives of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> visit were to
                            institute two Joint Commissions: an Economic-Commercial-Technical
                            Commission and a Defense Commission. There were numerous ideas currently
                            afloat about these commissions, <persName corresp="#p_SS_1"
                                >Sober</persName>
                            <pb facs="0136" n="101" xml:id="pg_101"/> continued. Regarding the
                            Defense Commission, for example, we would like to see if Saudi logistic
                            coordination with Iran can be worked out. As for the
                            economic/commercial/technical aspects, these were no secret. In fact,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> said, many countries
                            have been suggesting this sort of approach to the Saudis. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would see what it could do to promote
                            industrialization and other fields of cooperation. We could act as a
                            catalyst for US industry to participate in joint ventures. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> stressed that the entire subject
                            of Saudi-US commissions was subject to further talks between the two
                            governments. The Saudis continue to be sensitive over the Middle East
                            situation in general and disengagement in particular, lest they come
                            under attack from their Arab brethren.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir commented that our efforts with the Saudis sound very much like
                            the recent European-Arab dialogue—the object being to engage the
                            Arabs—particularly the oil-producing Arabs—in cooperative ventures which
                            will make it more difficult for them to resort to confrontation at some
                            future date. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> pointed
                            out that a major reason for our wishing to respond to Saudi requests for
                            assistance was to provide incentives needed to encourage the Saudis to
                            continue increasing their oil production. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> noted that our principal interest
                            in this matter was economic and financial; the Saudis place higher
                            priority on a joint defense commission than do we. He replied in the
                            negative to Weir’s question as to whether any qualitative change in our
                            defense supply policy vis-à-vis Saudi Arabia was contemplated. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> emphasized that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> did not envision a military alliance
                            or the stationing of US forces in Saudi Arabia other than that within
                            the framework of existing <gloss target="#t_USMTM_1">USMTM</gloss>
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir said that we seemed to be working on very parallel lines. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> had recently sent representatives
                            to discuss joint projects. It had been difficult for <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> to do this because of fear of favoring
                            some firms over others. However, the firms had eventually agreed among
                            themselves who should be represented. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1"
                                >Sober</persName> remarked we had not yet had to face this but it
                            could pose considerable difficulties for us when we did, especially
                            Congressional reaction. Mr. Wright said that <gloss target="#t_HMG_1"
                                >HMG</gloss> had made it quite clear that the group that did go to
                            Saudi Arabia was not in any way exclusive. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> remarked that a problem for us
                            was that on the one hand Saudi Arabia has hundreds of proposals from
                            various companies, but it prefers to work on a government-to-government
                            basis. This is difficult for us to do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir then gave details of the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>
                            offer to form an industrial consortium with Saudi Arabia, which has
                            recently been “put off” by the Saudis on the grounds that they are not
                            ready to provide personnel and formally institute such a body. It seems,
                            Weir said, the Saudis do not wish to get out ahead of their talks with
                            the US. [At] any rate, <pb facs="0137" n="102" xml:id="pg_102"/> he
                            continued, a British proposal was made in detail involving four <gloss

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>:</hi> Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> expressed the view
                            that tension between the two countries had lessened. Although
                            intermittent incidents continued to occur, <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> President <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1"
                                >Iryani</persName> was wisely continuing a policy which combined the
                            carrot and stick through unity discussions. These unity talks served to
                            let off some political steam even though unity still appeared to be an
                            unrealistic goal. The new Prime Minister, Makki, did not appear to be
                            very effective. However, his leftist reputation was useful in muting
                            pressure within the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> from the left.
                            Makki had apparently managed to gain at least tacit Saudi approval, even
                            though the Saudis were not happy with the choice. We understood that the
                            Saudi quarterly subsidy had been increased from 20 to 30 million Saudi
                            riyals following Makki’s visit to Riyadh.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir interjected that former Prime Minister al Ayni, when complaining
                            to him some time ago about the ineffectiveness of Saudi assistance to
                            the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>, had indicated that increased
                            subsidies would be the key to effective Saudi assistance, and thus the
                            increase was significant.</p>
                        <p>There was a brief discussion between the two sides as to how generous
                            Saudi assistance to the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> had been.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> suggested that the
                            Saudis have been more forthcoming than the Yemenis generally acknowledge
                            or the British perhaps realize.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>:</hi> Mr.

                            of the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> situation, noting that the
                            internal struggle continues with Salim Rubai Ali unable to take a more
                            moderate position until he is successful in neutralizing the influence
                            of NF Secretary General Ismail. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                                >Dickman</persName> observed that the opening of the Suez Canal
                            would offer increased commercial opportunities for Aden Port and that
                            this might result in some moderation of <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> attitudes toward the West and an easing of <gloss

                        <p>Mr. Weir suggested that it might be possible for <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> to create a free enterprise port
                            economy in Aden while leaving the hinterland under a socialistic system.
                            Turning to <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss>’s relations with <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, both Weir and Wright described them
                            as poor and very circumscribed. The main British preoccupation in <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> was to get Aden to lay off in its
                            support for <gloss target="#t_PFLOAG_1">PFLOAG</gloss> subversion in
                            Dhofar and the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName>’s
                            hypothetical question of how the US might handle any approach by <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> for improved relations, there <pb
                                facs="0138" n="103" xml:id="pg_103"/> was a discussion of the
                            “carrot-stick” argument. Mr. Weir noted that the Kuwaitis were the main
                            proponents of the carrot approach but the <gloss target="#t_FCO_1"
                                >FCO</gloss> was skeptical that economic aid to <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> would improve its behavior. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> had consistently advised the
                            Saudis that the proper approach to <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> was first to get a <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> commitment to cease making trouble with its neighbors
                            and then and only then consider financial help. Mr. Wright noted that
                                <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> had approached the <gloss
                                target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> last year about having a more
                            meaningful relationship but Aden was told that as long as it supports
                                <gloss target="#t_PFLOAG_1">PFLOAG</gloss> and the Dhofar rebels,
                            there was not very much that <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> could
                            do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> reviewed the general US
                            position on resuming relations with Arab countries that had broken
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, pointing out
                            that while we welcomed sincere approaches to restore relations, we are
                            not prepared to pay an economic price as a <hi rend="italic">quid pro
                                quo</hi> for restoration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                                >Dickman</persName> said that we were at the moment reviewing what
                            if anything we might do to respond to recent feelers from <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> for a dialogue. When Congressman
                            Findley had been in Aden, there were pretty broad hints that the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> was interested provided the US would
                            help get the Saudis off of <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>’s back
                            and indicated a willingness to provide some economic assistance. What
                            would the British think if we were approached by <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> to open an Embassy or as an
                            alternative an interests section?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Weir felt that if the US were to resume diplomatic relations with
                                <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, it would get very little out
                            of it at this time, other than some reporting. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> had virtually no dialogue with <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> authorities. Mr. Wright, on the
                            other hand, thought there might be an advantage to have a US Embassy. It
                            would serve as a counter to the heavy communist presence and it might
                            ease President Ali’s attempts to take a more moderate course. While he
                            did not think that opening the Canal would be all that spectacular for
                            Aden’s economy, he did note that <gloss target="#t_BP_1">BP</gloss> was
                            quite bullish. It felt that Aden provided unique bunkering facilities.
                            With regard to an interests section, Wright said that <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> would be delighted to have an American
                            join the Embassy staff in Aden but wondered if the US might not find a
                            better interlocutor.</p>
                        <p>The British side felt that the “stick” approach had worked thus far.
                                <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>’s economy was in desperate
                            shape. If it received aid from both the communists and the west, <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> would more likely continue its
                            subversion than hold back. Weir emphasized that it was important to bear
                            in mind the Arab support Oman now has; conversely <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>’s isolation from the other Arabs is
                            a helpful factor in the Omani situation. Any US–<gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> rapproachment might disturb this
                            desirable balance and one should be careful in rescuing <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> from its isolation. The British
                            noted that Congressman Findley’s mission to Aden, while helpful in
                            obtaining Franklin’s release, did little for two other Americans <pb
                                facs="0139" n="104" xml:id="pg_104"/> presumably jailed by Aden.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> noted that Findley
                            had asked about and been promised a reply concerning Torhan and
                            Kopp.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>:</hi> Mr. Weir
                            stressed that the <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> is considerably
                            more optimistic about the viability and political cohesion—and hence
                            future stability—of the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> than the
                                <gloss target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> had indicated in its talks last
                            September. The British had previously noted the ambitions of Shaikh
                                <persName corresp="#p_SIAS_1">Faisal bin Sultan</persName> (Under
                            Secretary of the Abu Dhabi Ministry of Defense). However, the Iranians
                            seemed to have scared off <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Shaikh
                                Faisal</persName> from any pretensions he may harbor to replace
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Shaikh Zayid</persName> by telling
                            him that they did not see any substitute to <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName>. Weir added that they believed
                            there appeared to be growing cooperation between <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> and Shaikh Rashid of Dubai.
                            While Dubai still does not contribute to the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1"
                                >UAE</gloss> budget, Rashid’s relations with <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> were much better now than they
                            were a year ago. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName>
                            said that we generally agreed with this British assessment, having felt
                            that the British were perhaps too pessimistic last year. The fragility
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> remains but growing
                            prosperity and economic activity provides a stimulus to leave things as
                            they are.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of the Abu Dhabi boundary dispute with Saudi
                            Arabia, Mr. Weir said there was no evidence of any progress. The Qataris
                            were quietly optimistic about their good offices, but did not expect any
                            forward movement soon. The <gloss target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> did not
                            think that anything had taken place at the Islamic Conference in Lahore
                            when <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> had met. The British
                            representatives had the impression that the Saudis were showing even
                            greater caution. The Saudis were concerned lest they make an agreement
                            with the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> and find shortly
                            thereafter, revolution taking place with a radical regime taking over in
                            the [<gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>.?] Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was continuing its efforts to get both
                            sides to settle this issue without taking on a role as a mediator.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Bahrain:</hi> It was agreed that the establishment of a
                            constitutional government and a National Assembly was basically a
                            healthy move. The ruling family, the British felt, was fairly optimistic
                            that orderly constitutional development would occur even though the
                            introduction of democracy to Bahrain was a calculated political risk.
                            Mr. Weir noted that the al Khalifa family might come to feel the need to
                            put the National Assembly genie back in the bottle but this would
                            probably not be possible. On balance, Weir thought the Assembly would
                            become more of a nuisance than a threat to the Bahrain regime. Mr. Weir
                            added that Bahrain’s relative economic weakness, the history of labor
                            unrest, and the Sunni-Shia divisions in addition to the relatively
                            advanced social and educational infrastructure make constitutional
                            development in <pb facs="0140" n="105" xml:id="pg_105"/> Bahrain
                            somewhat riskier than the similar earlier experiment in Kuwait. However,
                            Weir noted that the British had been more worried about the stability of
                            Bahrain in the 1950s than they are today.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1">Dickman</persName>’s
                            question regarding possible pressure on expatriate <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> security personnel to terminate their
                            services in Bahrain and Qatar, Mr. Wright said there has been no such
                            pressure, unless one were to count the traditional attacks in the
                            communist and leftist press against Ian Henderson, Bahrain’s Security
                            Director. Henderson has for years, ever since his anti-Mau Mau days,
                            been on the verge of resigning. Mr. Weir mentioned, however, that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>’s 60-man assistance team in
                            Sharjah, which is not doing very much, may disappear in the course of
                            economy cuts stemming from London’s current defense review.</p>
                        <p>Asked about <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">Mideastfor</gloss>, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> noted (1) we have not
                            been pressuring the Bahrainis on this issue in the conviction they will
                            ask our Navy to stay on if this is politically possible; (2) we hope the
                            progress now apparently achieved by the Secretary towards a
                            Syrian-Israeli disengagement will give the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> the leeway it feels it needs, but (3) if we still have
                            no positive signal from them in about one month, we will have to ready
                            ourselves to withdraw. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DFM_1"
                                >Dickman</persName> added that, although Shaykh Isa obviously wants
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> to stay, the fact
                            that Bahrain is now a parliamentary emirate creates a new situation to
                            which he must pay close attention.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Iraq</p>
                        <p>The British side said they had very few opportunities to read the Iraqi
                            mind. The Iraqis were very uncompromising on the Palestine issue. They
                            wanted closer relations with the West, not for political reasons but for
                            entirely pragmatic reasons of their need to have access to Western
                            technology and goods. Iraq’s relations with the Soviets remained very
                            close even though there were some occasional strains. The <gloss
                                target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> did not have any information regarding
                            the recent exchange of visits by the Soviet and Iraqi Ministers of
                            Interior. However, there was no indication that the Soviets had obtained
                            any special base privileges. Mr. Wright noted that there was a wide gap
                            between the <gloss target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> and the British
                            business community. The latter found business in Iraq was profitable and
                            the Iraqis paid well. The businessmen felt that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> had been unimaginative and
                            bureaucratic in its dealings with Iraq since diplomatic relations had
                            been restored.</p>

                        <p>In the aftermath of the October War, the oil-rich states of the Arabian
                            Peninsula and Persian Gulf have emerged as a potent new force. While
                            their new-found prominence has added another dimension to the future
                            stability of the area, the security of the Peninsula and Gulf states
                            revolves basically around a complex set of relationships which have been
                            operative for a long period of time. In this memorandum, we will examine
                            both traditional and new factors which will help determine how secure
                            and stable the countries of the region will be over the next few
                            years.</p>

                                unprecedented prestige throughout the Arab world by his actions
                                during and after the October war. Thus he is less susceptible to
                                attack from Arab radicals, and his hand in playing a leading role in
                                the stability of the Peninsula and the Gulf area has been
                                strengthened.</p>
                            <p>—Vastly greater oil revenues, if used effectively, might hold down
                                the discontent that has provided a fertile ground for radical

                        <p>—Rivalries and frictions among Gulf and Peninsula countries are about as
                            intense as ever. Especially troublesome are those between radical and
                            conservative regimes; they give rise to perennial strains such as those
                            between Iraq and Iran, between Iraq and Kuwait, between <pb facs="0142"
                                n="107" xml:id="pg_107"/> the two Yemens, and between South Yemen
                            and Saudi Arabia. They keep alive the protracted rebellion in the Dhofar
                            province of Oman.</p>
                        <p>—As the Gulf states achieve higher levels of development spurred on by
                            increased oil revenues, the political sophistication of the area will
                            also increase making it a more fertile ground for radical
                            ideologies.</p>
                        <p>—An upheaval led by revolutionary forces in the larger oil-producing
                            states is unlikely at this point, but if it occurred it would be
                            difficult or impossible to reverse and would threaten the US position in
                            the Gulf as a whole.</p>
                        <p>—Turmoil in one of the lesser states might lead to Iranian intervention,
                            which in turn could set the Arabs, including Saudi Arabia, against Iran.
                            We do not think this will happen, but if it did it could badly erode US
                            relations with both Saudi Arabia and Iran. The relationship between the
                            Saudis and Iranians is good, and although it is not likely ever to
                            become close, most leaders on both sides recognize the importance of
                            avoiding any real deterioration.</p>

                            They are trying to play between you and me. The Kalb book started it.

                            they will get their way. We need some technical excuses. They can roll
                            any aid bill through the Congress. The only resistance they take

                            Yes. Because they will get the word out, and it isn’t a threat to them.
                            I will propose talks with Egypt in September through Washington and that
                            they open talks with Jordan, to be completed after Egypt. If they agree
                            to this we can open the taps a bit. But can we argue it’s production
                            rather than a political hold up.</p>

                            US assistance in the military field. After three years of
                            procrastination they have decided that they do want the military
                            program. They have signed a contract with Raytheon for Hawk missiles and
                            have signed for A–4s. Total value of the program will be $300 to $400
                            million. The <pb facs="0146" n="111" xml:id="pg_111"/> Kuwaitis say they

                            mission can get under way but they will not begin until the Memo of

                            The problem is that I don’t know what the basic policy is. Is it to

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary:</hi> Yes, it is. How long have you been

                            Since the spring of 1974. I just need to know the policy.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary:</hi> The policy is: we should do it. We have
                            domestic problems in this area. Many groups are opposed to American arms
                            sales into the area even though others will sell the arms if the <gloss

                                    >Sisco</persName>:</hi> We have been pressing for the last
                            several years and the Kuwaitis have now made up their minds to go
                            American.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary:</hi> Go ahead.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>:</hi>
                            This will require Congressional approval.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary:</hi> Especially after the (Saudi) National
                            Guard problem. Be careful, but go ahead, the situation won’t be any
                            easier three months from now.</p>

                            The mission would consist of 9 or 10 men. If we underwrite the Kuwaiti
                            needs we should have more than we have talked about. This would amount
                            to several billion dollars over the next few years if we do underwrite
                            the Kuwaitis. If we don’t they will go commercial. Other key issue: is
                            extreme difficulty for Kuwaitis in getting some kind of knowledge about
                            how to handle their investments.</p>

                            Kuwaitis are small and need little in the way of infrastructure, but
                            they desire to maximize their investments world wide so that when their
                            oil runs out they will have a “perpetual annuity.” They also desire
                            joint ventures in third countries with <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> business.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_SW_2">Stoltzfus</persName>:</hi>
                            Yes. The Kuwaitis are afraid this will mean a confrontation, but are
                            ready to talk. They take keen interest, of course, but will not “set”
                            policy. The Kuwaitis say one thing, then do another. They know oil
                            prices are too high and that in a serious situation they would lose out.
                            They have the second highest proven reserves in the world and are
                            looking at the long run. They know the correct answers, but if Algeria
                            or another such country says something, Kuwait is not really big enough

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_STJ_1">Scotes</persName>:</hi>
                            Little hard information is available in Sanaa. The North Yemenis are
                            worried about subversion from the South. They are very concerned about
                            the Egyptian policy of supporting the regime in the South in an attempt
                            to wean the South away from the radical elements. The Egyptians have
                            gotten promises from the South, but the internal situation remains
                            unchanged. Therefore the South is still a potential threat to the North.
                            The North believes the weaning attempt is all right, but should be tied
                            to specific commitments on the part of the South. Money should not just
                            be supplied, but should be tied to specific commitments to change
                            policies vis-a-vis the rest of the peninsula. There is no overt pressure
                            on the border at this time, though refugees, whom the North can’t
                            support because its resources are insufficient, continue to cross the
                            border. South Yemen still sends an occasional sabotage team to keep the
                            North off balance.</p>
                        <p>The North is worried. It sees no change in the ideological disposition of
                            the South. In the long run, if there is no change, they believe South
                            Yemen could be the springboard for revolt in the peninsula. They are
                            also worried about recent diplomatic initiatives of the south—the effort
                            to gain diplomatic recognition.</p>

                            look to us for technology. Constraints on our relations? They have great

                            by “high level <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> threats,” but when
                            we presented the arguments concerning those threats as we were

                            to wipe out such a small nation. Their policy is to wait and see, and to
                            assess our motives in the Gulf. They want more direct contact and
                            explanation, more consultation, and for us to talk with them not to
                            them. They would like to hear our explanation before they read about

                            more than just a relationship with the British. They have more contact
                            with others, and the Sultan’s recent visit brought a very favorable
                            reaction. In the military field the question of rights on Masirah Island
                            went well. The Omani Foreign Minister was asked if the American request
                            would give any problems and replied none at all. He could control any
                            opposition from the Arabs. The Omanis are intensely interested in
                            modernization and of course in the Dofar war. They are receiving Iranian
                            help and Jordan has sent a battalion. There are some 3–400 guerrillas
                            fighting.</p>

                            a hard core group operating in very rugged terrain. In January the
                            rebels suffered 70–80 killed in action, so there is certainly some
                            fighting.</p>

                            will help to consolidate the confederation. In unsettled conditions,
                            they are trying to organize policies which will increase the knitting
                            together of the members, therefore they try harder to cultivate Arab
                            relations. This effort has led to some trouble with the Shah and with
                            Saudi Arabia. The <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> is very
                            realistic. When there is any sign of trouble with the Shah they
                            immediately back off and repair relations. They have given aid to Oman
                            and to North Yemen and support Egypt in its current efforts in South
                            Yemen. All in all their policies show a great deal of realism.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> is perhaps more conscious of the
                            Arab-Israeli question than other Gulf states. The young technocrats in
                            the government, right below Sheikh Zayyed, were mostly educated in
                            Cairo. They are matured Arab nationalists and therefore their attitude
                            toward the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is colored. This also
                            affects bilateral relations. At first (June, 1974) the attitude was
                            curiosity. Now they are more cautious. They are worried we can’t bring
                            off a peace settlement and are also worried that if some agreement is
                            reached on Sinai, the Syrians may be left out. There is a close bond
                            between Sheikh Zayyed and Syria. We have received desultory responses to
                            several of our proposals for closer relations, therefore, we are taking
                            it easy while trying to keep a dialogue open. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> is interested in the producer/consumer
                            conference but the Arab-Israeli question and energy policy as a whole
                            are more important. They want something to do; want to have some task.
                            They understand that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will spend
                            its major efforts in major capitals, and by the time they get down to

                            are not sufficient. This is the first administration to move at all, but
                            we must move step by step or all will be lost. Other Congressional
                            actions could be repeated here if we don’t move circumspectly. We have
                            nothing against moves in Egypt and Syria together, but the time
                            necessary to include Syria will likely mean a settlement will be more
                            protracted. It is important to move one step at a time. The <gloss

                            This would be the worst thing in the world. Whatever the attitude in the

                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> are thought of as terrorists. Within
                            the first two weeks we would have a total hangup. Gromyko would present
                            a list 175 paragraphs long and the Soviets would then take the position
                            as lawyers for the Arabs with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>

                        <p>It would be easy to start in Geneva but hard to get something out. If we
                            move at a careful pace, we are now at a point where results can be
                            achieved without high expectations. But, it would help if we make clear
                            our special problems in Arab countries.</p>
                        <p>Since the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is providing the movement,
                            they must trust our judgment. The next few months will tell. As a result
                            of this trip, I am very optimistic. It will be tough, very tough. Sooner
                            or later we have to solve the Syrian side, but the Arabs must get it out
                            of their heads that if we say it will happen it will. We may go to
                            Geneva, but that would mean a guaranteed stalemate. Your clients should
                            remember it is Israel which wants to go to Geneva so they can play the
                            delaying game. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> groups which
                            support going to Geneva are: 1) pro-Soviet and 2) those who want to see
                            a stalemate. In Geneva we would face all the dilemmas of constant
                            maneuvering for position which would make America’s position harder. The
                            job ahead will be hard. It will be murder. But in our problems with
                            journalists and congressmen, the groundwork has been laid. Without great

                            not a judgment of the President (by Congress), but a statement of
                            Presidential/Congressional relations. Actions by Congress regarding
                            Turkey, the Soviet trade agreement, etc. illustrate this. You must keep

                            abuse. I am not saying we want confrontation. We don’t, and we don’t
                            have to have confrontation. What leads to this belief (that we want
                            confrontation)? A misreading of our statements. We said we won’t use
                            political or military force to bring down prices. We have said we would
                            act in the case of actual strangulation. They (<gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                                >OPEC</gloss>) must create that situation, it can’t arrive in
                            current circumstances. We have meant to avoid three possibilities:</p>
                        <pb facs="0154" n="119" xml:id="pg_119"/>
                        <p>1. To discourage threats to use the oil weapon in the current
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>2. To encourage moderates so they won’t rely on the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>3. To decrease the readiness to go to war because they (Arab side) rely
                            on the oil weapon.</p>
                        <p>We won’t threaten force in this situation to achieve our goals, which
                            should be the subject of a producer/consumer conference. Force would
                            demand strangulation, which (latter) would not be in the Arab interest.
                            We are perfectly willing to go to a producer/consumer conference, but we
                            want a statement about what they want to talk about. What are their
                            goals? They should describe 2 weeks of such a conference. I fear that if
                            we go ahead prematurely with no idea what will be discussed, a deadlock
                            will result. We do not even have agreement on an agenda. If we play the
                            card with no result, confrontation will be more likely than with no
                            conference. If the meeting is not carefully prepared and the Europeans
                            try for a special relationship it could end in a nightmare.</p>
                        <p>We are prepared to begin bilateral talks immediately (on
                            producer/consumer). Let each say what they want and we will respond. We
                            must distinguish between willingness to talk and hesitation to talk
                            until positions are defined.</p>
                        <p>When the US goes to the preparatory meeting we will be fairly rigid. The
                            danger is that the meeting will turn into a “General Assembly” meeting.
                            Problems are: (1) will discussions include all raw materials, etc.; (2)
                            will the Europeans try for a special relationship with <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>; (3) what will we discuss? We can’t
                            talk about price till we get the other things settled. The last thing we
                            want is confrontation. We want a serious dialogue. We are prepared now
                            for a bilateral exchange of ideas. We would like to settle the issue of
                            the consumer/producer conference, as it concerns each nation,
                            immediately. We don’t want a multilateral mass meeting. We are facing
                            today a world-wide mass challenge to the nature of industrialized
                            society. If this turns into worldwide confrontation it will not help
                            producers either. We must work together: the oil producers must be able
                            to invest the money they earn, they must have stable investment
                            policies, they need our cooperation on their projects. We must define
                            the relationship under which we will discuss a long-term supply
                            relationship (if lower price, price must be guaranteed for a certain
                            period). Selling this last idea will be a problem in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> The President accepts these ideas if
                            they (<gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>) want, as well as an
                            investment program. We will work harder on this than on any other
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>We are not opposed to indexing. The producers can’t say, however, as many
                            do, that prices are too high and also ask for indexing. In fact
                            commodity prices are going down now so an indexing tied to <pb
                                facs="0155" n="120" xml:id="pg_120"/> commodity prices would not be
                            in the interests of <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>. If they
                            think sloppily they will fall in a trap. Has the fact that we face the
                            problem of inflation with recession penetrated? It could be, on supply
                            and demand alone, that a drop in oil prices will result and that there
                            will be an energy surplus in 5 years. They may well be able to get a
                            higher price now than in the future. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> will invest $500 billion in the future and will spend
                            $20 billion on exploration. We will find something. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> industrial machine will succeed. It is
                            not even a scientific problem. We know what to do, we don’t need great
                            discoveries. They are found. We just need to make them economical. Oil
                            prices of $6.50 to $7.00 per barrel are feasible except for synthetics.
                            When this happens, given the oil available, the price will come down.
                            Therefore, it is not definitely a sellers market. If <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> countries analyze the situation they
                            may not be so tied to indexing. I would like you to ask whether people
                            are ready for preparatory talks on this subject.</p>

                            It is not so much what we do in having the conference, but the fact that
                            we show they are sufficiently important to talk with them.</p>

                            Too many countries have been lumped together here. Iran seems to be the
                            source of most trouble in this area, the other little Arabs are not. We
                            can establish rapport, and it is important not to lump Iran and
                            Venezuela with the Arabs.</p>

                        <p>On US/Iranian relations. In the peninsula the Iranians are depicted as
                            the villains. I am not sure that this is the case. Your clients are no
                            doubt delighted to see someone push so that they can blame them. For
                            political reasons Saudi Arabia couldn’t and won’t take on Algeria
                            regarding oil prices. We have a common interest with Iran. Iran’s <pb
                                facs="0156" n="121" xml:id="pg_121"/> conduct of foreign policy
                            supports us. They have said they won’t participate in an embargo. Thus
                            we have resisted advice that we have a special confrontation with Iran.
                            The cost of such a confrontation would be out of all proportion to the
                            gains. It would not be in our interests. If we did create such a
                            confrontation and managed to get, say, a $1 per barrel reduction in oil
                            prices, what would it be worth? We value our relations with Iran. We
                            don’t recognize the Iranian preeminence in other parts of the world (in
                            the Gulf). We want to stay in step with Saudi Arabia and Iran, but will
                            not see Iran as a special villain. We don’t exempt Iran from any
                            analysis. They are vulnerable. A cut in production would hurt them,
                            whether it meant the same production for lower prices or lower
                            production at the same prices.</p>

                        <p>In the past decade, the Arab world has seen a sharp decline in the
                            importance of the rigid ideological dogma developed in the struggle for
                            independence from foreign control. The pan-Arabist movement, which
                            formerly had both a strong popular following and respectable prospects
                            of success, has lost most of its force and potential. Nasir, its
                            principal and charismatic spokesman, is dead. For most Arabs, the goal
                            of liberation has been achieved and that of unification has lost its
                            appeal.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The more important Arab countries are entering a
                                post-revolutionary era.</hi> New rulers—and more importantly, new
                            ruling classes—freed from the stigma of foreign collaboration are now in
                            charge. They have become the governing “haves” who have little to gain
                            and much to lose by further abrupt political and social change.
                            Committed to particular, essentially local, goals of their own, their
                            horizons have become more limited geographically and their aims more
                            conservative. They have <pb facs="0157" n="122" xml:id="pg_122"/> become
                            bureaucratized; the national institutions they created have acquired a
                            momentum of their own.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Such leaders as Asad in Syria, Boumediene in Algeria,
                                and <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> in Egypt appear to
                                be not just leading, but riding, a tide of greater sobriety and more
                                limited and practical objectives than their predecessors. This will
                                mean a diminished importance of ideology, less chance for
                                revolutionary social and economic change in most Arab states, less
                                interest in revolution as a political objective, and a less
                                important role played by specific leaders as opposed to the systems
                                in which they work.</hi> It will mean a greater concentration on
                            local as opposed to area-wide political issues. Intra-Arab problems will
                            tend to focus on such matters as trade, commerce, and cultural
                            exchanges. This trend shows promise of continuing in other Arab states
                            and areas, even including Palestine and the Persian Gulf states. Those
                            present Arab regimes, particularly in Libya and Iraq, which seek to
                            pursue a messianic, disruptive approach to domestic and regional
                            problems are outside the mainstream of Arab political life and are
                            likely to become even more so in the 1980s.</p>

                            Developments strongly adverse to the Arab case—particularly a decisive,
                            humiliating defeat—could bring on the toppling of several moderate Arab
                            leaders or lead at least some of them to embrace more radical and
                            extreme programs. This worst case scenario is not, however, the most
                            likely one. The regimes of the Arab states in confrontation with Israel
                            have already shown considerable staying power. Further, Arab
                            achievements, whether on the battlefield or with the use of the oil
                            weapon, are probable in the years ahead. While there can be no
                            certainties in this volatile, emotional affair, the forces favoring an
                            Arab-Israeli settlement on the lines pressed by the Arab moderates will
                            grow stronger over time. Indeed the chances now seem brighter than over
                            the past two decades that some basic easing of the situation will take
                            place over the next several years.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">A confrontation between the oil-producing states and
                                the major consuming countries of the industrial, non-Communist world
                                which culminated in military occupation of Arab oil fields by the
                                latter would have explosive, long-range political consequences.</hi>
                            Virtually every projection made above as to the viability of moderate
                            and particularist trends in the Arab states would be called into
                            question, if not negated. The region would become a volatile and
                            uncertain one for the occupiers and the occupied alike.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">A coup d’etat by a group which succeeded in imposing
                                extremist policies on an important state,</hi> and particularly on
                            Saudi Arabia or Egypt, could change the political orientation of much of
                            the rest of the Arab world. While such specific events are
                            unpredictable, their chances of occurring <pb facs="0158" n="123"
                                xml:id="pg_123"/> in the next decade seem poorer than in the past
                            one. Inside these Arab states, revolutionary dogmas have lost much of
                            their appeal, and the ruling forces have become more entrenched and more
                            representative of domestic trends. Further, the continuation of
                            moderate, particularist regimes, especially in the small, wealthy
                            Persian Gulf oil-producing states has become so important both to other
                            regional powers and to the non-Communist international community that
                            their current governments can probably count on very strong outside
                            backing in case of threat.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Egypt and Saudi Arabia will remain the two most
                                important Arab states because of the former’s military,
                                economic-strategic, and cultural predominance and of the latter’s
                                status as the world’s principal oil exporter.</hi> Their cooperation
                            has a good chance of surviving, even were the Arab-Israeli dispute
                            defused. But Egypt, for all its size and strength, will remain
                            comparatively impoverished and will seek some of the resources of the
                            oil producers, principally of Saudi Arabia. It is conceivable that
                            Egypt, under any leader, might become an unsettling force in the area,
                            using extreme methods—which could include strident ideological appeals
                            to the have-nots against the haves, or, more likely, open use of
                            national military power—to get what it considers its rightful share of
                            Arab oil money. Saudi Arabia, not unaware of this, has already invested
                            very heavily in the military build-up and economic needs of Egypt, and
                            Syria too. It will almost certainly be able to make its desires felt in
                            those countries and in other less affluent Arab states as well.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Most other Arab countries will remain of less
                                importance to the area and to the outside powers, the US
                                included,</hi> though this will vary case by case. A change in
                            regimes in some, e.g., Iraq and Morocco, could affect US bilateral
                            relations with them and their own ties with immediate neighbors, but
                            would not significantly change the political complexion of the Arab
                            world. A major war between Iran and Iraq, however, in which peaceful
                            trade in the Persian Gulf was jeopardized and oil facilities put out of
                            action would pose a major threat to the world economic order.</p>
                        <p>Internationally, Saudi Arabia and the other oil producers are unlikely to
                            exert much direct political pressure save in the case of the
                            Arab-Israeli dispute. With their implied or actual use of the oil
                            weapon, they will exert very strong—and perhaps decisive—influence on
                            Israel’s friends in the West to achieve Arab aims. As alternate,
                                non-<gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> energy sources come on
                            stream, this Arab political influence will begin to diminish, probably
                            at some time in the early 1980s, but will remain an important factor in
                            world politics for the rest of the century. In this period there will
                            always be some danger that reckless or ill-advised policies by the oil
                            producers could produce such severe economic and financial distress as
                            to provoke an armed confrontation. Today’s Arab leaders do not wish
                            this, but the danger will remain.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The more wealthy Arab states are likely, in the next
                                decade, to determine their foreign relations more by practical

                            “radical” states as Iraq will retain a residual suspicion of the US, and
                            Saudi Arabia will continue to be fearful of the <gloss

                            Communism. Indeed, <hi rend="italic">the combination of internal
                                sobriety and practicality is apt to be a dis-incentive for direct,
                                working relationships with either superpower.</hi> The less affluent
                            Arab countries, perhaps including Egypt, will be more prone to seek
                            outside assistance and to accept great power involvement in their
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will continue to remain
                            attractive to the Arabs as a source of military supplies; its influence
                            and presence will be linked to a considerable degree with the state of
                            tensions in the Middle East. It will be less able to compete with the
                            main non-Communist powers as a customer for oil, as a source of modern
                            technology, or as an object of investment. Barring some major military
                            cataclysm, or the emergence of a new dynamic pro-Soviet regime in Egypt,
                            its area-wide leverage is likely to decline.</p>
                        <p>So, too, though probably to a lesser degree, and for different reasons,
                            could that of the US. While the wealthy Arab states will be interested
                            in expanded commercial and economic relations with the West, they will
                            seek to avoid ties which might lead to enhanced outside political
                            influence, particularly from a superpower. In these circumstances, they
                            are likely to opt for closer ties with the West European states and
                            Japan than with the US. The poorer Arab states, however, possibly
                            including Egypt, will continue to seek political economic, and military
                            support both from the richer Mideast nations and from the major powers
                            of the Communist and non-Communist worlds.</p>

                            including the importance of oil, financial resources, and the need for

                            area with respect to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> objectives in
                            the following areas:</p>
                        <p>• Arms supply and training.</p>
                        <p>• Bases and installations.</p>

                        <p>• Economic policies.</p>
                        <p>• Regional relationships.</p>
                        <p>• Procedures for better implementation of existing and future policies

                        <p>The Gulf/Peninsula region is important to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> in the first place because it is important to the
                            West, and the primary Soviet goal is a negative one—to deprive the West
                            of influence there. This apart, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>’s interest in the area is based on its geographic
                            proximity, its strategic location between the Mediterranean Sea and the
                            Indian Ocean, its status in the general Middle East context, and its
                            economic <pb facs="0162" n="127" xml:id="pg_127"/> significance based on
                            vast oil deposits. While these elements translate into a broad desire on
                            the part of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to achieve the
                            strongest possible position there, no vital Soviet interests are
                            involved. This does not imply a lack of motivation to act. It does,
                            however, suggest a lower level of intensity in the Soviet effort and
                            less inclination to risk confrontation with the West than might be the
                            case in an area of higher priority.</p>
                        <p>Before 1973, the Soviets had made good progress in developing their
                            presence and influence in the area. Their 1972 Treaty of Friendship and
                            Cooperation with Iraq is the most far-reaching security treaty which the
                            Soviets have with any Third World country. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> gained access to the Iraqi ports of Basrah and Umm
                            Qasr and fairly extensive use of the South Yemeni port of Aden. Soviet
                            economic relations with Iran have developed significantly since the
                            early 1960s, and the Soviets have many economic advisors in place in
                            Iran as well as in Iraq and South Yemen.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets also have an impressive contingent of military personnel in
                            Iraq and South Yemen. The Soviet role in providing economic assistance,
                            military resupply, and spare parts has also helped give the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> some leverage in its dealings with
                            these two countries. Moreover, the Soviets have some compatibility of
                            interest with these clients, which facilitates cooperative action. Both
                            South Yemen and Iraq share the Soviet desire to radicalize the Gulf, and
                            both provide assistance to the so-called “progressive forces” which the
                            Soviets also back. While these states may be acting primarily on their
                            own initiative and in their own behalf, they are also advancing Soviet
                            interests in the Gulf, funneling Soviet arms and propaganda to
                            subversive and revolutionary elements.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet position in the area has, however, deteriorated since the 1973
                            Middle East war, and the prospects of a resurgence are not impressive.
                            This is due primarily to the growing wealth of the oil-producing Gulf
                            states which has contributed to several trends inimical to Soviet
                            interests. First, it has produced a new set of economic relationships
                            between these states and the West based both on Western oil purchases
                            and on the desire of the oil-rich nations to purchase products and
                            technology from the advanced industrial states. The Soviets have been
                            excluded from the resultant economic network.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, their increased wealth has permitted a new self-assertiveness
                            on the part of the major local states, Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are
                            determined to prevent Soviet encroachment. Iran, with some credibility
                            based on its rapidly expanding military strength, has expressed a
                            commitment to police the Gulf and exclude foreign intrusions. It
                            demonstrated its willingness to act on this commitment by intervening in
                            late 1973 to tip the balance for the Sultan in the struggle against
                            Soviet-backed rebels in Oman’s southern province of Dhofar.</p>
                        <pb facs="0163" n="128" xml:id="pg_128"/>
                        <p>Saudi actions, while less dramatic, may be producing even more profound
                            long-term effects. The Saudi weapon is money, and the goal is to
                            encourage moderation in the area. While Saudi policies are not often
                            pressed forcefully; their net effect has increasingly been to constrain
                            the expansion of Soviet influence in the area (and, as a consequence of
                            the Saudi-Egyptian combination, in the Middle East in general).</p>
                        <p>Soviet bilateral relations with those Gulf/Peninsula nations with which
                            they have had contacts have generally declined since late 1973. In the
                            case of Iran, this has been due to the Shah’s rapid arms buildup,
                            aspiration to predominance in the Gulf, and intervention in the Oman
                            struggle. North Yemen, with help and encouragement from Saudi Arabia,
                            has been able to move away from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. South Yemen has also sought money from the
                            traditionalist oil states—a situation which may eventually have a
                            moderating effect on its policies. And Soviet leverage over their major
                            client in the area, Iraq, has declined as that nation has improved its
                            economic position, patched up its relations with Iran, and turned to the
                            West for technology and equipment.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, Soviet efforts to improve political and economic
                            relations with the traditionalist Arab states of the Gulf have thus far
                            proved unsuccessful, Kuwait being to some degree an exception. In spite
                            of repeated Soviet initiatives, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
                                (<gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>), Bahrain, Qatar and Oman
                            refuse to have any formal dealings with Communist countries.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s efforts to gain some
                            leverage over the region’s energy resources have, to date, also proved
                            fruitless. It has established firm trade relations with Iran and Iraq,
                            importing primarily gas and oil and exporting machinery and equipment.
                            It does therefore have access to key energy markets. But the quantities
                            involved are small, and both Iran and Iraq have proved tough in
                            negotiating payment terms for their energy exports, preferring hard
                            currency to barter arrangements and demanding market prices from the
                            Soviets. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has thus failed to
                            lay the groundwork for large-scale future purchases at concessionary
                            rates.</p>
                        <p>In their effort to become the main patron of subversion and revolution in
                            the Gulf area, the Soviets have registered only one gain in recent
                            years: the fact that the Chinese have seen fit to abandon local
                            competition with the Soviets. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            itself has accomplished little. The rebellion in Dhofar which the
                            Soviets backed has failed abysmally, and subversive forces elsewhere in
                            the Gulf have thus far made few gains. The main result of Soviet support
                            of subversion has been to further alarm the traditionalist states which
                            have been the objects of these efforts.</p>
                        <p>And finally, while some advantages have accrued to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> from its efforts to cultivate
                            clients, the clients themselves have been <pb facs="0164" n="129"
                                xml:id="pg_129"/> frustratingly independent. In addition to North
                            Yemen’s movement away from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in
                            recent years, the Iraqi Baathists continue to pursue a number of
                            policies which are objectionable to the Soviets. They oppose such Soviet
                            Middle East policies as support for a Geneva conference, they repress
                            the Iraqi Communist Party, and they are continually at odds with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>’s other major Middle East
                            client, Syria. In short, the extent of the influence which the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> seems able to gain in these
                            countries is limited. When there is a coincidence of interests, Soviet
                            backing may enable the client state to pursue mutual goals for mutual
                            benefit. When these interests conflict, the Soviets may try to force
                            their will by threatening to slow down arms shipments or cut financial
                            assistance. Such strong-arm tactics have brought immediate results on
                            occasion, but at the cost of antagonizing the client.</p>
                        <p>In spite of the current adverse trend in the region, Soviet policy-makers
                            do not appear to be shifting their tactics. They continue to pursue a
                            two-track policy in the area. On the one hand, they seek improved
                            relations with the conservative oil-rich states in the hope that they
                            might neutralize and reverse the negative influence being exerted by
                            Iran and Saudi Arabia, prevent Western domination of the oil resources
                            of the region, insure their own potential access to the oil, and tap the
                            hard-currency holdings of the wealthy Gulf states.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Soviets try to foster the accession to power of
                            sympathetic radically-minded regimes which will be responsive to Soviet
                            policy interests, permit Soviet access to port facilities, welcome a
                            Soviet physical presence, and deny the same to the West. To this end,
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> supports subversive and
                            revolutionary forces whose stated goal is the overthrow of the
                            traditionalist governments of the area.</p>
                        <p>While these clearly contradictory approaches must complicate Soviet
                            efforts in the region, the Soviets actually have little to lose by
                            supporting subversion and revolution—their relations with the
                            traditionalist states could hardly be worse. They probably reason,
                            moreover, that the situation in the region is fluid and that they can
                            well afford to wait for favorable opportunities to develop.</p>
                        <p>Such opportunities might include another Middle East war accompanied by
                            an oil embargo which would again undermine Gulf-state relations with the
                            West, or a deterioration in US relations with these states due to
                            disagreements over the Arab trade boycott or US weapons sales. Either of
                            these developments could lead to an improved Soviet political position
                            in the region based largely on the desire of the Gulf states to put
                            pressure on the US. However, the Soviets would still be unable to absorb
                            or pay for the oil in which the Gulf states would be drowning and would
                            still not have the technology and expertise which these states want to
                            purchase. This, combined with the continuing <pb facs="0165" n="130"
                                xml:id="pg_130"/> regional antagonism towards the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, would act as a limiting factor on
                            the extent of any rapprochement.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets will, in all likelihood, increase their oil imports in coming
                            years, and, should their need to import coincide with either an oil
                            embargo or substantially increased production in the Gulf states, it is
                            likely that some barter arrangements could be made between the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and these states. This eventuality
                            is unlikely to affect the long-term economic situation, however. Soviet
                            imports will rise gradually, and the oil states, if they choose to do
                            so, will probably have the capacity to meet both Soviet and Western oil
                            requirements. In addition, the Western market will continue to be
                            preferred, as the oil states will still want hard-currency payments
                            rather than barter arrangements.</p>
                        <p>In the event one or more of the conservative governments of the region
                            were overthrown and a radical government established, the Soviets would
                            be the obvious beneficiaries. As Iran and Saudi Arabia would probably
                            not tolerate such an occurrence in one of the smaller states of the
                            region, with the possible exception of Kuwait, where their intervention
                            might draw a countering Iraqi reaction, the main question becomes what
                            effect such a change might have in one of these larger countries.</p>
                        <p>Should reformist elements prepared to deal with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> come to power in Saudi Arabia, doors
                            now shut would open to the Soviets elsewhere in the Gulf, and they would
                            quickly enlarge their presence. Saudi efforts to check Soviet influence
                            throughout the Gulf might cease and Soviet-backed radical groups in the
                            smaller Gulf states, particularly Kuwait and Bahrain, might be
                            tolerated. This would certainly be even more the case if radicals were
                            to come to power in Saudi Arabia. However, economic reality would
                            presumably continue to limit the extent of Soviet-Saudi cooperation.</p>
                        <p>As a more highly developed and socially complex country than Saudi
                            Arabia, Iran may be more vulnerable to a radical takeover. And the
                            potential benefit to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would be
                            more obvious. A complex economic relationship already exists between the
                            two and geographic proximity makes further cooperation feasible and
                            desirable from the Soviet point of view. Iran has overwhelming local
                            military superiority and the capacity to control passage through the
                            Straits of Hormuz. This has strategic implications for the West as well
                            as for Iran’s Gulf neighbors. For these reasons, the Soviets would be
                            strongly motivated to provide clandestine assistance to radical forces
                            in the event of insurgency in Iran.</p>
                        <p>While the above contingencies or other, as yet unforeseen, developments
                            could disrupt the pattern and alter prevailing tendencies, the current
                            combination of factors is clearly detrimental to Soviet interests in the
                            Gulf/Peninsula region. Continued antagonism toward and suspi<pb

                            major Gulf states, contradictory Soviet policy approaches, the growing
                            wealth of the Gulf states, and the expanding economic network between
                            these states and the West all work to impede Soviet progress. Should
                            these factors remain fairly stable, it seems likely that the forces
                            working against Soviet penetration will remain dominant in the
                            region.</p>

                        <p>More than a year ago, the Department of Defense recommended a review of
                            our arms sales policy toward Iran. Further discussions with State and
                            Defense pointed up the need for our Iranian security assistance policy
                            to be considered in the broader context of US security interests and
                            policy in the Persian Gulf as a whole. A broad study of US Persian Gulf
                            policy had been conducted in 1970–72, resulting in <gloss

                            formed the basis of our policy ever since. However, a number of

                        <p>With your approval, <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 238 was issued
                            in February 1976, calling for an examination of US political and
                            strategic goals in the Persian Gulf, with policy alternatives for the
                            near and medium term. Economic issues were to be considered but
                            primarily as background, since <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>
                            237 on energy was to deal with this element of our relations with the
                            Gulf states. The Interdepartmental Political-Military Group chaired by
                            the Department of State prepared a study response which was submitted to
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff in May 1976. The spread
                            sheet summarizing Conclusions and Policy Options is at Tab D. The study
                            response was long on identifying and discussing issues (it is a
                            veritable encyclopedia of recent Persian Gulf political and economic
                            history and problems) but short on succinct presentation and useful
                            recommendations. The all-inclusive approach of the study response
                            identified more than 100 possible options and sub-options, but there
                            were no agreed recommendations, nor was there an Executive Summary.</p>
                        <p>In order to obtain a policy document suitable for top-level review, the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff worked with the most

                            and the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to develop a draft

                            /> response) and several broad policy options. In addition, a set of
                            procedures was proposed for improving interagency consideration of
                            requests for military equipment and for improving the management of
                            ongoing security assistance programs. These proposed procedures were
                            derived from a careful case-by-case study of the management of our
                            security assistance programs and the handling of arms requests for the
                            Gulf states over the past several years, and from criticisms and

                        <p>After receiving official Agency comments, we have now revised the

                            options or recommendations (the State preference). We have separated the
                            proposed arms transfer procedures for consideration as a separate issue
                            by the <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss>.</p>

                            Undersecretary level to monitor global arms transfer policy, leading

                            AECB is available to establish policy and administer procedures. As you
                            know, other interested Agencies favor establishment right away of a
                            senior arms transfer board chaired by State, but believe that it should
                            be established at the Assistant Secretary level rather than the
                            Undersecretary level.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">YOUR APPROACH AT THE MEETING</p>
                        <p>We suggest that you open the meeting by reviewing briefly some of the
                            major issues which gave rise to <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>
                            238, noting that these issues will remain and will probably need to be
                            addressed by the new Administration during its first few months in
                            office. In introducing the three principal items on the agenda, you
                            should note that the objective <pb facs="0169" n="134" xml:id="pg_134"/>
                            of the meeting is to provide a basic framework for policy decisions
                            which will probably have to be made sometime in 1977 and to ensure that
                            the new Administration inherits an effective system for the orderly
                            review of security assistance issues which are likely to arise during
                            the early months of 1977.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Executive Summary and Study Response</p>
                        <p>For the reasons listed above in the background section, a full-scale
                            review of United States security assistance (including military supply)
                            policy and programs has become essential. The results of this review
                            will certainly be of special interest to the new Administration and to
                            Congress, which is aware that a <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>
                            has been underway for some time. Congress has adopted a resolution (and
                            key individual Members have indicated they intend to adhere to it)
                            opposing consideration of any new <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            cases for Persian Gulf states until the policy review has been
                            completed.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 238 study
                            response and Executive Summary, you should point out the complementary
                            nature of the two papers. You may wish to add that, in view of the
                            extensive prior consideration of these two documents, the meeting should
                            try to avoid getting bogged down in minor and editorial issues.</p>
                        <p>While it might be unwise for this Administration to adopt formally a
                            comprehensive policy for the Persian Gulf less than a month before the
                            Inauguration, it would be very useful to provide the next Administration
                            with an agreed top-level, interagency summary of the historical and
                            strategic framework of US policy toward the Persian Gulf plus an
                            indication of the key issues which are expected to require high-level
                            policy consideration at an early date. The study response to <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 238 and the revised Executive
                            Summary prepared by the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff can
                            serve that purpose and should formally be transmitted to Mr. <persName

                            Members of Congress before January 20 that this has been done, and
                            possibly provide them with a brief summary of the review.</p>

                        <p>As pointed out in our memo of December 16, there are a number of reasons
                            why a <hi rend="italic">decision on these procedures should be taken now
                                and not be postponed:</hi></p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—It is important to have established procedures in operation to deal
                                with important <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> cases which are
                                anticipated during the early days of the next Administration.</p>
                            <p>—The proposed guidelines are the result of several years’ experience
                                and incorporate suggestions from our Embassies and <gloss

                                    >ACDA</gloss>. They also take into account Congressional and
                                other criticisms and recommendations. They are neutral <pb

                                view and will facilitate rather than interfere with any future
                                policy review.</p>
                            <p>—Establishment of these procedures will also provide a tangible and
                                useful outcome of the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> process
                                which should help reassure the Hill that major arms transfer cases
                                will receive careful study and appropriate high-level policy
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>—If a decision on the procedure is not taken now, it is difficult to
                                predict when an orderly interagency system might be adopted to
                                replace the present approach which has on past occasions failed to
                                provide adequate interagency review and coordination, particularly
                                vis-à-vis Congress.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>If State should recommend postponing action on these procedures until the
                            next Administration, you should note that these guidelines are technical
                            rather than political. They are merely designed to improve management of
                            on-going security assistance programs. As such, their adoption is
                            particularly appropriate now in order to provide effective machinery for
                            use by the new Administration during the period when new individuals are
                            assuming unfamiliar responsibilities and when fundamental policies are
                            being reviewed—yet when they will be faced with the continuing need to
                            review <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> requests and manage
                            effectively existing programs (which will probably be the object of
                            continuing criticism).</p>
                        <p>If State objects to the use of the Middle East Arms Transfer Panel, you
                            can point out that it is the only existing body presently available
                            within the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> system to implement the
                            procedures effectively. It does not limit in any way the establishment
                            or the authority of a senior State-chaired group for global arms policy
                            such as the Arms Export Control Board proposed by State. As indicated in
                            the footnote on page 1 of the recommended procedures, it is understood
                            by all Agencies that the MEAT Panel would be subordinate to such a
                            State-chaired body when it is established.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Energy-Security Assistance Interrelationship</p>
                        <p>The need is evident for close coordination between our security
                            assistance (including military supply) policies and our energy policies
                            with respect to Persian Gulf countries, particularly Iran and Saudi
                            Arabia. However, there is no agreement—although there are many different
                            ideas—on how this can be done in a manner which would enhance overall
                            United States interests. This is a useful opportunity to explore Agency
                            views on the nature of the interrelationship (including the sharply
                            debated question of US security assistance leverage over oil price and
                            production decisions) and to get them on the record for the eventual
                            consideration of the new Administration. It would probably be better to
                            agree from the outset that the <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> will
                            not seek to reach specific conclusions on this subject but rather

                        <p>The meeting began at 3:03 p.m.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">General <persName corresp="#p_SB_1"
                                    >Scowcroft</persName>:</hi> We are faced with a dilemma. It is
                            inconceivable to me that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Government is unable to develop a policy toward the Persian Gulf. We
                            have had a <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> Study. It has its good
                            aspects but we have been unable to bring it to a resolution. The
                            Executive Summary which has been prepared is only a pale reflection of
                            the <pb facs="0172" n="137" xml:id="pg_137"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>. It contains no options. In
                            addition parts of this Study and the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"
                                >NSSM</gloss> 223 study have been bandied about the Hill so that
                            Congress expects us to come up with <hi rend="italic">something</hi>. It
                            is a sad reflection that after a year we have been able to produce <hi
                                rend="italic">nothing.</hi> This is the reason for the meeting. My
                            idea is that we should do what we can to get something to leave, a core
                            of responsible policy options and analysis to our successors.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1"
                                >Robinson</persName>:</hi> I agree but also believe that after one
                            year something important has been accomplished. The Report is a
                            remarkable achievement. But is it applicable now? Do we have the basis
                            now for saying that this is the way to go? We have some minor textual
                            emendations to add to the summary. Basically we think this a worthwhile
                            effort to present the new Administration. But it would be inappropriate
                            to make key policy decisions now. The decisions taken at Doha have
                            fundamental implications with regard to our strategy and tactical
                            position. This is a good report. I think we should submit it to the new
                            Administration. So they can use it as a basis for deciding on
                            policies.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">General <persName corresp="#p_SB_1"
                                    >Scowcroft</persName>:</hi> We ostensibly do studies for a
                            purpose, that purpose is to make policy. Right now this paper is not in
                            any condition to be useful.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1"
                                >Robinson</persName>:</hi> It has no options.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">General <persName corresp="#p_SB_1"
                                    >Scowcroft</persName>:</hi> Yes, it is different from other
                                <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> studies that we have done
                            since it has no options. Even if we make no decisions, there should be
                            options.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1"
                                >Robinson</persName>:</hi> Our suggested textual emendations will
                            make it stronger, they contain some policy choices.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">General <persName corresp="#p_SB_1"
                                    >Scowcroft</persName>:</hi> Bill, what do you think?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName>:</hi> I think the Report is reasonable,
                            although it is not as strong in some places as I would like. Probably we
                            could never get agreement on a really strong report. I am inclined to go
                            ahead and make these decisions based upon our knowledge. This is such an
                            important region. Why procrastinate? If we don’t make decisions the new
                            people might want to restudy the whole thing over again and lose another
                            year. They would want to restudy it because of its importance. It is
                            like putting old shoes on your feet. The region is important today and
                            will remain so for the next 5–10 years. This is a careful study. It
                            could be turned into a decision document to go to the President. Then
                            the new people would have a policy which they are free to change. Now
                            there is no policy. We are in limbo. We should do something.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1"
                                >Robinson</persName>:</hi> A decision now would mean that you have a
                            policy with no possibility of implementing it.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName>:</hi> There are varying degrees. In some cases
                            we can make clear decisions, in others we can waffle, in others we can
                            simply pass it along.</p>

                                    >Scowcroft</persName>:</hi> The way the Study is now it would be
                            useless to the next Administration.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. Ikle:</hi> In ten days would it be possible for the

                                    >Scowcroft</persName>:</hi> It could be done in a week.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Dixon:</hi> Even if it were done now, the new
                            Administration would want to restudy it.</p>

                                >Clements</persName>:</hi> Yes, but in the interim there would be a
                            policy. There are important things happening in the region.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1"
                                >Robinson</persName>:</hi> What you are now speaking about is
                            impossible. The Transition Team would say that you are wasting your
                            time. Making decisions are one thing. Implementing them is something
                            else.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName>:</hi> There are certain decisions which State
                            has had pending for a long time which have been awaiting the completion
                            of this Study. If these decisions are made in conformance with the
                            Executive Summary we would at least be on record as to what we think
                            ought to be done. Decisions will be needed in the next six months and
                            these forthcoming decisions should not be made without this guidance. If
                            we just do nothing we would be derelict in our duty. If they don’t like
                            it they can change it.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1"
                                >Robinson</persName>:</hi> There are only two weeks to go. Lets be
                            realistic. There would be no way to implement the decisions.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName>:</hi> It is inevitable that decisions will

                            There would be no problem generating something. I would like to see the

                            covered. Unless some decision is taken soon, we will lose Kagnew but

                            We could divide the issues two ways, by time and importance. Perhaps
                            there are 6 issues with 2 or 3 choices on each. Mystic Star is one
                            issue. Do we move it to Tehran or not?</p>

                            of saturation. What kind of a quid would the Shah want? It opens a

                            recommended the broader framework of the Arms Export Control Board.
                            There are major issues involved and something needs to be done to
                            regularize the process. The major differences involve the level of the
                            organization. A key and rather unique element is the Secretary of
                            State’s statutory responsibilities in this area. There are two basic
                            proposals. Either have it at the Deputy Secretary level such as the
                                <gloss target="#t_SRG_1">SRG</gloss> chaired by the Undersecretary
                            of State for Security Assistance—the other proposal would move it one
                            step down with the same Chairman but a panel composed of Assistant
                            Secretaries which would then report to the Secretary of State. The
                            problem with the higher level is the anamoly of having this group report
                            to the Secretary of State who would then have to come back to the
                            President and then back to the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>.
                            Thus I am attracted to the idea of an interagency group at the Assistant
                            Secretary level which would coordinate day-to-day work. This Group would
                            then report through the Under Secretary for Security Assistance to the
                            Secretary of State then if there were any problems they would come back
                            to the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> at the <gloss

                            <p>—the vital relationship of the region’s <hi rend="italic">energy

                                particularly for our Middle East and Soviet policies; and</p>
                            <p>—the common US-Saudi-Iranian interest in <hi rend="italic">limiting
                                    Soviet influence</hi> and resisting other radical influences in

                        </quote>
                        <p>During the Cold War period, the US gave a high priority to relations with
                            Iran and Saudi Arabia out of concern that their vast oil reserves not
                            fall under Soviet control and out of a desire to use strategic locations
                            in these countries for military and intelligence purposes. The strong
                            anti-Communist and anti-Soviet views of these countries’ leaders
                            inclined them to close association with us and our interests. Both
                            countries, especially Iran, enjoyed the benefit of our security umbrella
                            and support against Soviet pressures. During this period we viewed the
                            paramount British security role as adequate to guard US and Western
                            interests in the Gulf shaikhdoms.</p>
                        <p>The British military withdrawal from the Gulf in 1971, coupled with the
                            rapidly increasing importance of Gulf oil to the West, prompted a review
                            of our policy options. <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 66 (1970)
                            and the derivative <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDMs</gloss> 92 (1970) and
                            186 (1972) on Persian Gulf security problems reconfirmed—and events
                            surrounding the 1973 Arab-Israeli War proved—the great importance of the
                            Persian Gulf to US interests. We concluded that our interests would best
                            be served by (1) encouraging Saudi-Iranian cooperation; (2) developing a
                            special military supply relationship with those two countries, while
                            restraining arms supply to the smaller regional states; (3) not reducing
                            the US naval presence in the Gulf, subject to review if it proved to be
                            politically unacceptable to US friends in the region; and (4) tacitly
                            supporting regionally initiated security arrangements, with the small
                            states looking to larger neighbors for their security. Implicit in this
                            policy direction was a determination that we should encourage regional
                            powers to assume responsibility for maintaining regional as well as
                            their own security. Our premise has been that Iran and Saudi Arabia have
                            the potential to fill this role in a manner compatible with US
                            interests. On this basis we have supported what has become a major
                            effort to assist them in developing their defense capabilities,
                            recognizing that even in the case of Iran this capability is primarily
                            regional and can have only a dissuasive, delaying effect vis-à-vis the

                            imports and 10 percent of consumption, 65 percent of Western European
                            imports and 61 percent of consumption, and almost 75 percent of Japanese
                            imports and consumption. The percentage for the US will continue to
                            increase. The Gulf states’ oil revenues were $72 billion in 1975.
                            Although they spent about $35 billion for imports from the United
                            States, Western Europe, and Japan, and disbursed $4 billion in
                            concessional assistance, reserves stood at $53 billion at year’s end.
                            (Saudi Arabia holds approximately half these reserves, virtually all of
                            which are deposited in Western Europe and the United States.) Reserves
                            continued to grow in 1976 as revenues and imports increased and foreign
                            assistance declined.</p>
                        <p>The recession which has affected the global economy over the past two
                            years has been significantly deepened and broadened by the inflation
                            caused by higher oil prices. Economic recovery and stable growth,
                            particularly for certain Western European and most developing countries,
                            will continue to depend on effective recycling of foreign exchange from
                            the key Gulf states (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>, eventually Iraq) and on the
                            willingness of these states to moderate oil price increases while
                            maintaining adequate production.</p>
                        <p>Iran and Saudi Arabia have used their greatly increased economic power to
                            expand their political influence in the Middle East and to play a more
                            active role on the world political and economic scene, as well as to
                            undertake massive economic and military modernization programs at
                            home.</p>
                        <p>The increased importance of the Persian Gulf is evident to states outside
                            the area. The Western Europeans and Japanese appear prepared to pay a
                            relatively high political price if necessary to obtain assured supplies
                            of oil, and are actively attempting to expand their markets for military
                            and industrial equipment as well as consumption items. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and its allies have also sought—with

                            relations with Iran and to expand their influence beyond existing
                            political, economic, and military supply beachheads in Iraq, Syria and
                            South Yemen, and they await an opportunity to exploit any radical change
                            in Iran or the moderate Gulf Arab states.</p>
                        <p>In response to this new situation, primary US policy objectives toward
                            the area (particularly Saudi Arabia and Iran) have evolved gradually
                            over the last two years, supplementing the essentially security-oriented
                            policy guidelines of <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDMs</gloss> 92 and 186.
                            Current policy objectives include:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—Maintaining access to oil supplies at manageable prices and in

                            <p>—Obtaining the support of Saudi Arabia and Iran for US policy on such

                            <p>—Maintaining a vigorous and increasing level of exports to and
                                investment from the Gulf states;</p>
                            <p>—Satisfying US requirements for military communications and

                                movement of vital resources; and</p>
                            <p>—Denying the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> a predominant
                                role in the Gulf-Northwest Indian Ocean region.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>In the main, we have been successful in realizing these objectives. The
                            political orientation of the region has remained moderate and pro-West.
                            Bilateral relations with the US have become closer. Iran and Saudi
                            Arabia have moved effectively, although not always with the speed or
                            manner we would have chosen, to support the smaller states and help them
                            establish and maintain political stability since the British withdrawal.
                            With Iranian assistance, Oman has withstood a radical rebellion fomented
                            by South Yemen and supported by Iraq, Libya, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Cuba. North Yemen has shifted
                            its political orientation toward Saudi Arabia and the West, away from
                            Iraq and the Soviet Bloc, thanks in part to an agreement with Saudi
                            Arabia and the US on the supply of military equipment and training. The
                            Saudis have also had limited success in moderating South Yemen’s foreign
                            policy, though the radical coloration of the government remains roughly
                            the same.</p>
                        <p>The major Gulf states have also been supportive of US political interests
                            outside the Gulf area and their influence and wealth have contributed
                            significantly to our Arab-Israel peacemaking effort. Iran has also
                            contributed to stability in South Asia by balancing its support for
                            Pakistan with economic assistance to India and Afghanistan. Iran
                            maintained its flow of oil to the West (and Israel) despite the 1973–74
                            Arab embargo and continues to oppose the idea of an embargo (even <pb
                                facs="0181" n="146" xml:id="pg_146"/> though it strongly advocates
                            higher prices). Since the 1973–74 embargo Saudi Arabia has been
                            particularly instrumental in maintaining adequate supplies of petroleum
                            products to the West and, in the past year, in resisting additional
                            increases in price favored by other <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> nations. The nations of the area have acted in a
                            generally responsible manner in their handling of petro-dollar
                            investments in the West and in increasing assistance bilaterally and
                            multilaterally to developing nations, although on a highly selective
                            basis. They have also shown a degree of preference for US goods and
                            services despite increased competition, although certain US actions
                            against the Arab boycott of Israel could have an adverse impact on the
                            ability of US firms to compete for business in Saudi Arabia and other
                            Arab states.</p>
                        <p>Both Saudi Arabia and Iran have deliberately chosen to link their
                            extensive security development programs to the United States. They have
                            come to rely on the United States not only for the provision of weapons
                            systems and modern military technology but also for professional advice
                            in shaping their security forces and for training of their military
                            personnel. This reliance on US cooperation and assistance extends to
                            nearly every aspect of their military development and is likely to
                            increase rather than decrease over the next decade as they face the
                            problems of integrating new systems and new technology into their force
                            structure and as the bulk of goods and services which these nations have
                            purchased from the United States through the Foreign Military Sales
                            program is delivered. This very close association ensures that the
                            United States will have considerable influence on the structuring of the
                            military forces of these states, the development of their military
                            doctrine, the skills and basic attitudes of their military personnel,
                            the evolution of internal security, and to some degree the general
                            orientation and direction of national military strategy. Although there
                            are definite limits to our general influence and specific policy
                            leverage, the dependence of these states on US cooperation and
                            assistance in the security field clearly constitutes an impetus for the
                            military establishments, and to a lesser degree, the governments of
                            these countries to act in a manner generally consistent with US
                            interests. As such, our security relationship represents a policy asset
                            of significant importance, which is not currently available to any other
                            external power.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, it is evident that the accelerated pace of change in the
                            Persian Gulf region, particularly over the last two years, requires a
                            fresh look at US policy. A number of problems have emerged, in some
                            cases due directly to the very magnitude and intimacy of our security
                            relationship with the larger states of the area, and economic and
                            political trends which were hardly visible in the early 1970’s have <pb
                                facs="0182" n="147" xml:id="pg_147"/> become much more clearly
                            defined in the wake of the events of 1973. The spectacular rise of oil
                            prices and the consequent accumulation of revenues have permitted the
                            Gulf states to undertake massive economic and military modernization
                            programs. These programs have brought with them increasing domestic
                            strains and have created problems in bilateral relations with the US
                            while heightening national ambitions. Incipient movement toward regional
                            political cooperation remains troubled by subsurface rivalries and
                            mutual suspicions, and effective formal regional cooperation remains
                            elusive. The traditional fabric of Gulf societies has come under heavy
                            strain as a result of the massive influx of foreign technology, foreign
                            technicians and workers, and the rapid growth of personal wealth and
                            urbanization among the populations of these states. The increasing
                            involvement in inter-Arab affairs and Middle East diplomacy of Saudi
                            Arabia (and Kuwait and the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> to a
                            lesser degree), and the active involvement of Iran in the Middle East,
                            South Asia and the Indian Ocean could open the Persian Gulf increasingly
                            to the issues and rivalries of these areas. Of immediate importance for
                            the United States is the strong interest of Saudi Arabia in maintaining
                            momentum toward a solution of the Arab-Israel dispute. The Saudis have
                            indicated that progress on this issue will be an important element in
                            the evolution of their relations with the US.</p>
                        <p>Iraq’s ideological radicalism continues to pose a political threat to the
                            rest of the region despite its growing economic pragmatism and the
                            suspension of its active dispute with Iran. Although not explosive, the
                            relationship among the Lower Gulf states is uneasy in that the
                            traditional rivalries between the former Sheikhdoms and their tribal
                            leaders persist and they are not prepared to join fully with Iran or
                            Saudi Arabia in a regional security grouping. This poses an immediate
                            problem for the US in the increasing demands of the smaller states for
                            assistance in building up their own military forces.</p>
                        <p>Important questions remain unanswered about the long-term balance of
                            power in the Gulf where Iran, by virtue of its size, population, and
                            developmental edge, possesses a growing preponderance of military
                            strength. The relative tranquility of the Gulf since the British
                            withdrawal has been due in part to the successful resistance by
                            generally conservative regimes to the pressures of revolutionary Arab
                            nationalism (spearheaded in the area by South Yemen, Iraq, the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and the Popular Front for the
                            Liberation of Oman). The future stability of the area and the
                            willingness of the traditional Arab regimes of the Peninsula to
                            cooperate with Iran, on the one hand, and with Iraq and South Yemen, on
                            the other, will depend in large part on the dynamics of the struggle
                            between the ideological appeal of Arab nationalism and the pragmatic
                            approach of the traditional regimes. Failure of the recent meeting of
                            Gulf Foreign Ministers to agree upon even a limited step <pb facs="0183"
                                n="148" xml:id="pg_148"/> toward regional security cooperation, and
                            the split among Gulf states on the <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> oil price decision of December 17 at Doha, are
                            indicative of the differences still prevailing in the region, and of the
                            different views of Iran and Saudi Arabia on certain issues. On the other
                            hand, successful Iranian and Saudi cooperation in dealing with South
                            Yemen—both in ending its support for the Dhofar rebellion in Oman and in
                            handling the problem of the Iranian F–4 shot down in South Yemen
                            waters—is indicative of the strong mutual interest the two regimes
                            share, despite undercurrents of acrimony between them, in resisting
                            radical change and threats to regional security.</p>
                        <p>In view of the vital importance of the Gulf area and transit routes from
                            the regime, and in view of the increasing Soviet naval and air presence,
                            the United States began in 1973 to maintain an increased military
                            presence in the northwest Indian Ocean by means of routine periodic
                            deployments of naval and air units from the Pacific Fleet. The only US
                            military facility capable of providing support for these deployments is
                            the joint US–<gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> installation on distant
                            Diego Garcia. The US presently is able to use some additional airfields
                            and ports in the general vicinity of the Persian Gulf on a very limited
                            basis for routine operations. However, the current level of access to
                            support ashore is only adequate to sustain a low-level, routine military
                            presence; and the uncertainty surrounding the future status of Middle
                            East Force illustrates the tenuousness of even these arrangements. The
                            initial apprehension which the smaller Gulf states experienced at the
                            British withdrawal and which led them to welcome a continued US military
                            presence, has largely been replaced by a sense of growing
                            self-confidence in their own ability to maintain regional stability
                            without outside assistance. So long as this attitude persists, US access
                            to military facilities in the Gulf will be subject to severe
                            constraints.</p>
                        <p>Finally, current US arms policy has emerged as an issue. The vast surge
                            of oil revenues since 1973 has permitted both Iran and Saudi Arabia to
                            go much further much faster in development of their military
                            capabilities than could have been foretold in 1969. The high visibility
                            of the large defense purchases by Iran and Saudi Arabia from the United
                            States, the difficulties both nations are having in manning and
                            supporting their complex new weapons systems, the asserted effect of the
                            sales in fueling arms races, and concern about potential uses of large
                            quantities of sophisticated weapons, have raised questions in this
                            country about the ability of these countries to absorb this weaponry and
                            about the consistency of this policy with long-term US interests in the
                            region. It has also raised questions about the effectiveness of our
                            management of these programs (and the prospect of being blamed for
                            potential program failures), and about the long-term impact on the
                            economic and social structure of the two countries. At the same time,
                                <pb facs="0184" n="149" xml:id="pg_149"/> Iran and Saudi Arabia have
                            indicated their sensitivity to the questioning of our established
                            security assistance relationship as potentially undercutting the close
                            bilateral relationships they have established in other important areas
                            with the US. Iran recently concluded an important arms deal with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, justifying this action in
                            part by the failure to acquire certain similar weapons from the US. The
                            Soviet view of US policy is shaped, inter alia, by the level of US
                            weapons, advisors and facilities in regions adjacent to the <gloss

                            US interests in the Gulf region over the next decade, we should bear in

                            successes achieved to date, and particularly in the past decade. This
                            general approach has relied on the balanced use of three principal

                            in those areas where the major Gulf states have come to see their own
                            national and regional interests as generally compatible with those of

                            interrelationships between the key US role in supporting the Iranian and

                            Next Decade</p>
                        <p>By direction, the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 238 study
                            addressed 17 security-related issue areas, some of which will be
                            critical to the development of US policy over the next decade. The study
                            presents four broad policy options: (1) continuation of current policies
                            and procedures; (2) a reduced US security role; (3) an expanded US
                            security involvement, and (4) more active encouragement of regional
                            security cooperation, along with enhanced policy management. The study
                            provides illustrative decisions which would logically flow from adoption
                            of one of these broad policy lines, regarding military supply, US
                            security facilities, etc., making clear, however, that some of the
                            subsidiary options, according to the mix, could be consistent with more
                            than one of the broad policy alternatives.</p>
                        <p>The key issue areas are summarized below. The first three of these issues
                            (in upper case type) concern security-related issues which require high
                            level policy review and decision early in 1977. In considering these
                            issues for the future, the US must keep in mind three broad questions:
                            (a) the level and type of local forces we would like ideally to see in
                            the Gulf; (b) the desired distribution of power among the regional
                            states; and (c) the optimal US military/security presence in the area.
                            The remaining issues are also very important to the evolution of US
                            policy relationships in the Gulf over the next decade. The evolution of
                            Soviet influence in the area and the growing importance of Iraq for US
                            policy are developments which should continue to be monitored carefully;
                            however, in neither case have the trends advanced to the point where a
                            change of US policy would appear to be required. The policy implications
                            of energy and related economic issues will need to be addressed in
                            parallel with these essentially political and security issues. This can
                            best be done in the context of <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>

                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">SECURITY ASSISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS.</hi> The
                            experience of the past few years resulting from the extensive US
                            involvement in the security field in the Gulf, particularly with Iran
                            and Saudi Arabia, has dramatized both the opportunities and the
                            potential risks involved in responding to requests from regional states
                            for major military programs involving complex technology and rapid
                            development of modern military structures. The quantities and increased
                            sophistication of weaponry purchases by Gulf countries, particularly
                            Iran, are straining the absorptive capacity of purchasing governments
                            and adding to the potential for social and economic stresses. Programs
                            which exceed the technical, manpower and financial capabilities of
                            recipient states will in the long run weaken rather than strengthen our
                            relations with the country concerned and in some cases could eventually
                            undermine their internal stability. Large scale purchases of advanced
                            weapons systems by Gulf states have also prompted concerns that an arms
                            race may <pb facs="0186" n="151" xml:id="pg_151"/> have developed
                            between rival states which could contribute to political destabilization
                            of the region and thus work to the disadvantage of US interests in the
                            long term.</p>
                        <p>The presence in certain Gulf states, particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia,
                            of growing numbers of American personnel, both government employees and
                            employees of private American companies, poses new and potentially
                            difficult problems. There is the risk that American citizens might
                            become involved in international and domestic conflicts involving their
                            host government or that their presence might require US intervention or
                            otherwise limit our options in a crisis. There is also the problem of
                            potential negative economic and sociological impact of large numbers of
                            Americans upon peoples of very different cultures, with resultant
                            internal and bilateral political problems which can be exploited for
                            anti-American and anti-government ends.</p>
                        <p>The dramatic increase in US sales of defense articles and services has
                            resulted in domestic concern and closer Congressional scrutiny of the
                            Administration’s response to military supply requests from Persian Gulf
                            nations. These developments, plus US setbacks in Angola and Indochina
                            and the arms embargo against Turkey, have heightened concern by Iran and
                            Saudi Arabia as to the reliability of the US commitment to support them
                            politically as well as to continue our support for their military
                            establishments.</p>
                        <p>Although all of these problems are real, none of them appears to be
                            unmanageable or to make imperative a fundamental shift in US policy,
                            although alternative policy approaches should be given careful
                            consideration. At the minimum, however, these problems point to the need
                            for ensuring a continuation of the careful review presently given major
                            arms requests at the highest levels, and of the close attention given to
                            security assistance programs. A recommended set of systematic procedures
                            has been developed in conjunction with this Executive Summary, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 238 study. It takes into
                            account certain Congressional observations as well as Agency
                            recommendations derived from the lessons of the past few years. Use of
                            these procedures should ensure systematic interagency review and
                            decisions on future requests for defense articles and services and that
                            on-going programs are managed as effectively as possible in order to
                            minimize the difficulties inherent in such extensive and complex
                            relationships as the US has with Iran and Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">LOWER GULF ARMS SALES.</hi> The practical effect of
                            our relatively stringent case-by-case review of arms sales to the Lower

                            participation in the introduction of more sophisticated equipment into
                            the smaller <pb facs="0187" n="152" xml:id="pg_152"/> Gulf states and in

                            their growing requests.</p>
                        <p>Over the past year, the smaller nations of the Gulf have been approaching
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> more insistently to provide
                            weapons systems such as fighter aircraft, air defense missiles, <gloss

                            equipment and training. They are aware of what the US has been doing in
                            the way of military supply for other Gulf states, particularly Iran and
                            Saudi Arabia, but also Kuwait. France and Britain have not exercised the
                            same restraint as the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in their own
                            sales policies to the Lower Gulf. There is no demonstrable desire by the

                            tending to become a political status symbol for the smaller states of
                            the Gulf. In some cases, the governments of the smaller states have told

                            advanced weaponry will be an important factor in our bilateral
                            relations, influencing such issues as whether or not the US can have
                            access to desired military facilities, e.g. homeporting of <gloss

                        <p>The political and security benefits which the US might gain from

                            possibility that this would touch off an accelerated mini-arms race
                            among all the Lower Gulf states, thereby increasing pressures on the US
                            (and the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> and France) to sell still
                            more. This could create problems with Iran and Saudi Arabia, if they
                            perceived the US as deemphasizing its policy of relying upon the two
                            larger states for regional security and providing them with military
                            assistance to this end. We should also anticipate vigorous opposition
                            within the Congress to any major modification of present restrictions on

                            usual multi-track tactics with the aim of lessening Western influence.
                            Much will depend on:</p>
                        <p>—how the Soviets calculate the tradeoffs between stress on support for

                            extremism and whether perceptions of US policy in this vital area are
                            positive or negative;</p>
                        <p>—the nature of relationships among the principal Gulf powers and the
                            internal political stability of the Gulf regimes (e.g. Iran, Saudi

                        <p>f. <hi rend="italic">Iraq.</hi> The exploitation of Iraq’s extensive oil
                            and gas reserves is increasing rapidly, and its ambitious development
                            plans (largely Western-oriented) are also proceeding, creating a
                            situation whereby its oil production will approach that of Iran by 1985.
                            This growing economic importance and pragmatism has been partially
                            paralleled by a new political look, notably the 1975 agreement resolving
                            Iraq’s long riparian boundary dispute with Iran. It is also noteworthy
                            that the US has become one of the major sources of Iraq’s non-military
                            imports. However, Iraq has remained obdurately opposed to an
                            Arab-Israeli settlement; continues to back extremist Palestinian
                            elements, even in the face of solid opposition by the Arab moderates; is
                            apparently dedicated to overthrowing the Asad regime in Syria; and is
                            still regarded with fear and suspicion by the moderate Gulf states.
                            Recently it has used its armed forces to threaten militarily and to try

                        <p>Iraq’s increasing importance will demand continuing close attention to

                            along moderate lines over the next decade. At present, our policy of
                            quietly encouraging the growth of economic ties with Iraq and making
                            clear our willingness to consider sympathetically any Iraqi initiative
                            for closer political relations, without taking the initiative ourselves,
                            appears to be correct. Current Iraqi animosity to policies and regimes
                            favored by the United States in the Middle East is so great that an
                            initiative by the US would be misinterpreted by our friends and would be
                            unlikely to have any useful effect on Iraq’s leadership. However, there
                            are reports of internal differences over Iraq’s extremist policies, and
                            the US should be prepared to encourage moderation should the opportunity
                            occur—preferably after consultation with key states friendly to the
                            United States in the area.</p>

                            reserves of the Gulf states give them the potential to intervene
                            massively in world investment markets. However, they realize that their
                            economic future is tied to that of the developed countries, and it is
                            strongly in our own interest to integrate them further into the Free

                            by 1985. In 1975 the Gulf states provided more than $4 billion in
                            economic aid to developing nations. Although this assistance went
                            primarily to Islamic states and particularly the confrontation states,
                            the nations of the Gulf can be expected to play a significant future
                            role in bilateral and multilateral development assistance. A growing
                            problem for these states will be the demands of Third World nations for
                            economic support and protection against the effect of increased oil

                            reduced US security role; and (3) an expanded US security involvement.
                            In determining our optimal policy in this region, our desired strategic
                            stance vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> must be
                            borne in mind. In general, a decision to pursue one or another of these
                            three broad policy lines would logically entail a certain set of
                            decisions on the individual issues for which options are presented.
                            Given the diversity and complexity of the issues, some of these options
                            do not conveniently fit into a single policy posture; there are a great
                            number of possible permutations and combinations. This strongly suggests
                            that decisions on some issues might involve a selection of options from
                            more than one policy “package.”</p>
                        <p>Two aspects of our Gulf security relationships—military supply and
                            military presence—raise interrelated contradictions and ambivalencies.
                            The “powers” on whom we rely primarily for the region’s security—Iran
                            and Saudi Arabia—are consequently major recipients of US military
                            supply. Iran’s willingness to allow the US to operate its own technical
                            facilities is of vital importance (particularly given the US problems
                            with Turkey). Access to Iranian air and naval facilities as well as to
                            Saudi facilities is also useful. Yet both Iran and Saudi Arabia are
                            increasingly less supportive of such presences as US military “bases,”
                            and other evidence of extraterritoriality and agreed privileges in their
                            own countries and elsewhere in the Gulf. Iran is sensitive over any
                            increase in the size or number of US facilities while Saudi Arabia is
                            not disposed to grant the US such facilities. The weakest states, Oman
                            and Bahrain, who have received very little security assistance from the
                            US, are torn between a desire to achieve a “special relationship” with
                            the US, in part to forestall slipping irretrievably into the
                            Saudi/Iranian spheres of influence, and sensitivity to the stigma of
                            retaining a “colonial” image by granting military presence privileges to
                            a “Great Power.” They, along with the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1"
                                >UAE</gloss> and Qatar, want an entree to US military supply
                            comparable to that the other “ministate,” Kuwait, enjoys; and the
                            appetites of all are whetted by our extensive supply relationships with
                            Iran and Saudi Arabia. In return for US facilities, the weaker states
                                <pb facs="0192" n="157" xml:id="pg_157"/> tend to seek something in
                            return, and the evidence to date is that their preferences will be in
                            the security assistance area, either special consideration in terms of
                            what we might sell, or concessional financing for their purchases, or
                            both. The stronger states also see a clear if not explicit link between
                            US security assistance and US facilities.</p>
                        <p>As we seek to cope with the dichotomy between relying on regional powers
                            to ensure Gulf security and seeking to preserve our own military
                            presence in the area, while trying to find a security assistance
                            relationship consistent both with our several goals in the Gulf and
                            growing pressures for limiting arms supply, we are faced with classic
                            policy dilemmas. Moreover, our economic and other non-military relations
                            with the Persian Gulf countries interact with our security relationships
                            and their impact needs to be taken into account in making final policy
                            choices. Our choices will depend on how we weight our interests, how we
                            link them strategically to proximate objectives—and our own time
                            preferences.</p>

                        <p>Under this policy, we would retain current military sales, training, and
                            technology transfer policies for all the Persian Gulf
                            countries—essentially a five-level policy on military sales to the Gulf
                            in descending order of sales latitude: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lower
                            Gulf, and Iraq.<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">US sales policy has been

                                capacity, and the Saudi relationship with the Arab-Israel dispute.
                                Sales of defensive materiel have been approved for Kuwait, although
                                we are not presently undertaking any major new programs at least

                                equipment suitable for internal security, or non-sophisticated
                                weapons of a defensive nature. No military sales are approved for
                                Iraq. [Footnote is in the original.]</note> We would maintain the
                            level and scope of sales to Iran—helping to ensure that it continues to
                            develop as the major power in the Gulf while acquiring a limited Indian
                            Ocean strategic capability by 1985—and to Saudi Arabia. We would
                            undertake further analysis to determine whether new intelligence and
                            support facilities should be established in Iran, recognizing that they
                            would probably require a quid pro quo in the security assistance field
                            if the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> were to accede to a US
                            request. We would seek either to negotiate an extension of the Middle

                            inform Oman that we are interested in regular access to the Masirah
                            Island airfield. In the economic field (apart from energy policy, the
                            subject of <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 237), we would
                            continue close cooperation with Iran and Saudi Arabia in their economic
                            development. We would continue an essentially passive stance on regional
                            cooperation.</p>

                        <p>An objective of this policy would be to arrest the upward trend of our
                            security involvement in Iran—where the policy would be felt most
                            sharply—and to reduce military sales and our military presence on the
                            other side of the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>This policy would entail a somewhat more restrictive approach to US
                            military sales and transfers of technology to the Gulf region, with the
                            US making decisions on what to supply based upon its own assessment. The
                            US assessment would use such criteria as: external threat; military
                            balance considerations; our best estimate of the absorptive capacities
                            of the recipients; and the long-term, rather than short-term, effects of
                            such sales and transfers on US interests. We would attempt to dissuade
                            West European arms suppliers from selling weapons in excess of the Gulf
                            countries’ own defense requirements as we see them. In Iran we would:
                            implement currently approved sales but reduce the level and scope (i.e.,
                            variety of systems) of future sales, and suspend approval of new
                            military coproduction proposals for an indefinite period. We would
                            maintain the restrictive sales policy toward the Lower Gulf states,
                            adding Kuwait to the future application of this policy. We would

                            the Gulf and encourage smaller states to obtain training from neighbors.
                            US security assistance would be related more directly to regional
                            security cooperation, encouraging bilateral or multilateral arrangements
                            among or between Gulf states in such sectors as air and coastal

                            would not express interest in increased use of the airfield at Masirah,
                            or adding other military facilities there. On the economic side (apart
                            from energy), we would limit the official US role to primarily
                            encouraging sales of non-controlled commercial goods and to assisting
                            development projects clearly within the absorptive capacity of the Gulf

                            while minimizing the likelihood of unexpected or undesirable long-term

                            should be made in the context of overall Persian Gulf policy.</p>
                        <p>One approach would be for the Executive Branch to consult the Congress on
                            the following formula: The rapid institution of improved procedures for
                            managing our security assistance programs; a pledge expeditiously to
                            reach decisions on fundamental policy issues for the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in the Gulf area; and meanwhile,
                            proceeding with the less controversial 36(b) cases which have been
                            delayed but not with major new and anticipated weapons requests.</p>
                        <p>We might also consider the pros and cons of adopting a temporary “pause”
                            in additional sales of all major lethal end items while undertaking a
                            searching policy and program review. Specific options on military sales
                            policy are as follows:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Option I</hi>. Continue our five-level arms sales
                            policy for Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Lower Gulf and Iraq. Maintain
                            a forthcoming sales policy with respect to Iran (and to a lesser degree
                            Saudi Arabia) in order to promote their mutual capability to provide for
                            the security of the Gulf area and to cement our close working
                            relationship with both nations, but also consider the impact of Saudi
                            requests on the Arab-Israel dispute. Continue the military sales policy
                            for the Lower Gulf and Oman, set forth in 1972 by <gloss
                                target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 186, that has been applied
                            stringently to preclude the supply of sophisticated or destabilizing
                            equipment. Maintain a clear distinction between our policy on the
                            transfer of sensitive technology and the supply of military equipment
                            and training.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Option II</hi>. Continue present restrictive policies
                            toward the Lower Gulf and Iraq, and our temporary freeze on major new
                            programs for Kuwait. Deliberately reduce the scope of future Iranian and
                            to a lesser extent Saudi purchases by applying more stringently our
                            present case-by-case review procedures, critically analyzing it in terms
                            of its impact on the absorptive capacity, regional military balance,
                            postulated threat and proposed mission, the status of our existing
                            relations, desired level of US presence in each country, and other
                            primary criteria; and then explaining fully to the requesting country
                            the difficulties which we <pb facs="0196" n="161" xml:id="pg_161"/>
                            foresee in acceding to any request deemed to be excessive. This would be
                            accompanied by a firm decision not to entertain requests for the sale of
                            certain types of systems to any Persian Gulf state (e.g., man-portable
                            air defense systems, amphibious vessels above a certain size,
                            surface-to-surface missiles with extended ranges, and equipment

                            to Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, while liberalizing our policy in the

                            options obviously parallel the three broad policy postures discussed
                            above. Similarly, periodic deployments of naval and air forces to the

                            could be increased or decreased in response to decisions on these broad

                        <p>Early in 1977 the Administration will be faced with decisions on a number
                            of arms sales proposals involving countries of the Middle East and
                            Persian Gulf. The major pending requests (i.e., formally submitted but
                            not approved) and those expected in the next few months are summarized
                            at Tab A. The pending requests by Iran and Israel are the most
                            significant militarily due to the quantities and the high level of
                            sophistication, but their political significance could be matched by
                            anticipated requests from Saudi Arabia and Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Decisions taken will have much greater impact than would ordinarily be
                            the case since they will be interpreted by the countries of the two
                            areas, by our allies, by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                            by the Congress as revealing the long-term attitudes and policies of the

                            during the past year. Thus, the response of the <persName

                            prospects for peace and stability in the two areas. Specifically, the

                                (<gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> and commercial) has averaged
                            approximately $10 billion per year. Although the dollar value of sales
                            to most areas of the world has remained roughly equivalent (in constant
                            dollars) with the levels of grant military assistance provided by the
                            United States in the 1960s, the striking exception to this rule is the
                            Middle East and Persian Gulf. Since October 1973, more than $19 billion
                            of US defense articles and services have been sold to the nations of
                            these areas. More than 40 percent of these sales have been to Iran, 34
                            percent to Saudi Arabia, and 22 percent to Israel, with relatively small
                            proportions to other nations such as Kuwait and Jordan.</p>
                        <p>For better or worse, the willingness of the United States to supply arms
                            has come to be perceived by the governments of the Middle East and
                            Persian Gulf as an indication of both the extent of US bilateral support
                            and the direction of overall US policy in the region. Arab countries see
                            such sales as evidence of the balance being struck in our approach to
                            the Arab-Israeli dispute, and watch with extreme care sales to Israel,
                            just as Israel carefully monitors the level of US arms sales to the
                            Arabs. Both sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict see the supply of arms as
                            of major political as well as military significance. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> feels very strongly on this point
                            and has recently reiterated to visiting Congressmen and Senators his
                            strong feelings that the time has come when his policy shift away from
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and toward the US, to the
                            severe detriment of Egypt’s armed forces, should qualify Egypt for the
                            purchase of sophisticated weaponry (e.g. F–5 aircraft and <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> missiles) from the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> At the same time, the Arab Ambassadors
                            in Washington have been collectively presented the strong concern of
                            their governments over the impact on the peace process of the recent
                            sale of four items of military equipment to Israel and Israel’s recent
                            additional military requests. Iran and Israel exchange military
                            information and each observes closely what the other obtains from the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Saudi Arabia observes closely
                            what Iran obtains from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and also
                            compares <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> support for Israel with
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> willingness to help meet their
                            own more modest defense goals.</p>
                        <p>Thus, decisions by the United States on military supply requests have
                            taken on a significance to important Middle Eastern and Persian Gulf
                            countries much greater than the individual military items or items in
                            question. Several countries, most notably Iran and Egypt, are clearly
                            prepared to turn to a closer military supply relationship with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as well as Western Europe if
                            too disappointed by the US response to their requests, particularly if
                            others appear to be more favorably treated. The Saudi reaction to severe
                            disappointment could impact on oil prices <pb facs="0200" n="165"
                                xml:id="pg_165"/> as well as result in a considerable shift away
                            from US and toward European sources for both military and civilian goods
                            and services, but in all probability not a shift to Soviet-supplied
                            arms.</p>
                        <p>The importance attached to US security assistance programs by our friends
                            and allies in the Middle East and Persian Gulf where we have substantial
                            national interests thus underscores the necessity of following a
                            carefully reasoned arms transfer policy. The advent of a new
                            Administration provides a unique opportunity to review the fundamental
                            direction of US policy in this field without upsetting the present
                            political relationships which are quite favorable to US interests.</p>
                        <p>There are three basic approaches which the new Administration can adopt
                            in dealing with these pending or anticipated requests for arms sales: a)
                            continue the present policy of general responsiveness on an ad hoc basis
                            to all friendly countries, attempting to meet as much of their request
                            as can be justified without upsetting the general politico-military
                            balance in the area or placing undue demands upon the US military
                            establishment; b) decide to adopt a selective policy freezing the supply
                            of certain categories of weapons to all countries in the area and/or
                            applying special restrictions to certain but not all countries; c)
                            deciding upon a temporary pause of several months in approving major new
                            requests from any country in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf while
                            a broad review of arms supply policy is conducted.</p>
                        <p>The first approach, continuing the present policy of ad hoc
                            responsiveness on a case-by-case basis to all friendly countries in the
                            Middle East and Persian Gulf, could be seen as inconsistent with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s stated
                            position on arms exports and would tend to perpetuate the difficulties
                            between the Executive Branch and the Congress on this issue. While
                            providing maximum flexibility for the continuation of a policy of close
                            bilateral relations, the absence of consistent, coherent policy
                            criteria, creates serious problems in deciding upon requests which could
                            have a negative effect upon US regional interests as well as upon arms
                            limitation objectives.</p>
                        <p>The second approach of freezing selected categories of equipment to
                            selected nations would create serious problems of determining which
                            systems and which nations would receive favorable treatment. It would
                            limit our policy flexibility and could lead to a strongly negative
                            reaction from nations which considered themselves the victims of
                            unjustified discriminatory treatment. This reaction would probably be
                            most intense from those key states (e.g. Iran and Israel) which have the
                            most important security relationships with the United States. Such a
                            procedure would pose stark choices between US interests in sustaining
                            certain political relationships and arms control desiderata, risking an
                            outcome which is satisfactory to neither. For example, a freeze applied
                            only to the Persian Gulf might be appealing to Congress and would avoid
                            the <pb facs="0201" n="166" xml:id="pg_166"/> problem of applying
                            limitations to the supply of arms to Israel, but it would be far more
                            upsetting to Iran and particularly Saudi Arabia than if it were applied
                            to both the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. Moreover, this approach
                            would not deal with the tough problem posed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s intention to request
                            sophisticated weapons, in part to test the good faith of the new
                            Administration toward Egypt and its basic attitude toward an
                            Arab-Israeli settlement. The large Middle East part in the world arms
                            buildup would continue virtually unchecked.</p>
                        <p>On balance, we have concluded that the relative disadvantages argue
                            against the first two approaches and in favor of the third approach as
                            outlined below.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposal:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">That President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName> announce, immediately after January 20, that
                                no new requests for major arms sales to the Middle East and the
                                Persian Gulf will be approved and submitted to Congress for an
                                indeterminate period of time lasting at least several months.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This temporary pause in new arms sales would continue until the
                            Administration has completed a thorough review of the arms requests now
                            before it and its overall arms policy in the region, taking into
                            consideration the prevailing military and political situation, the
                            prospects for regional peace and stability, and the possibility of
                            reaching agreement among both potential suppliers and recipients on
                            effective means of limiting the increased flow of arms to this sensitive
                            area of the world. (A draft announcement is at Tab B.)</p>
                        <p>We believe the political impact of such an initiative would be
                            substantial, while the actual effect on military capabilities of
                            individual countries and on the military balance in the two regions
                            would be slight. A pause would not affect delivery of items already
                            approved (including the four items recently approved for Israel) nor the
                            sale and delivery of spare parts, ammunition, construction, training,
                            and non-lethal equipment. Programs affected would be those where
                            delivery is at least a year and usually several years in the future. In
                            addition, the US could assure affected countries that we would do our
                            best to ensure that delays in accepting their orders would not affect
                            delivery schedules for those items ultimately approved and that we would
                            resume deliveries if a crisis were to arise. Furthermore, by applying
                            the pause to all Arab countries in the Middle East plus Egypt as well as
                            Iran and Israel, the US would have demonstrated its seriousness of
                            intention and even-handedness of approach to both arms control and peace
                            negotiations. Finally, the Administration would be able to avoid, during
                            an unusually sensitive period, specific arms supply decisions which
                            would be highly controversial with certain countries of the Middle East
                            and the Persian Gulf as well as with Congress.</p>
                        <pb facs="0202" n="167" xml:id="pg_167"/>
                        <p>The objective political and military circumstances in both the Middle
                            East and the Persian Gulf are favorable for a pause in new arms
                            transactions during the first part of 1977. This judgment would not
                            necessarily be accepted by all of the Governments of the area, nor would
                            it fully satisfy those who are intent upon a rapid military buildup.
                            However, it is the US assessment and can be supported by detailed,
                            comprehensive analysis.</p>
                        <p>In the Middle East, Arab and Israeli attention is focused on prospects
                            for peace rather than planning for another round of hostilities.
                            Therefore, a pause in approving new deliveries would tend to reinforce
                            rather than run counter to the prevailing mood; there is also no sign on
                            the horizon of a sharp increase in tensions in the Persian Gulf which
                            would justify new arms transactions. In both the Middle East and the
                            Persian Gulf, there is no notable military imbalance nor any individual
                            country (other than Egypt) which has a clear need for a further
                            long-term military buildup or for any specific arms system. With the
                            exception of Egypt, there are in the pipeline for delivery between now
                            and 1980 considerable amounts of weapons already approved by the US.</p>
                        <p>This is particularly true of Israel and Iran, the two countries with the
                            most ambitious plans for future acquisitions from the United States.
                            Israel is estimated (see <gloss target="#t_NIE_1">NIE</gloss>
                            35/36–I–76) to be capable of retaining its strong military superiority
                            over potential Arab enemies through 1981 with only those weapons already
                            on hand or presently under delivery plus spare parts, ammunition, etc.
                            Iran probably has as many arms on hand or under delivery as it is
                            capable of absorbing without great strain and is facing no serious
                            immediate threat. Completion of Saudi Arabia’s long-term military
                            program (worked out with <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> advice and
                            emphasizing construction and training more than weapons acquisition)
                            will not be seriously impeded by a pause in the approval of major
                            weapons transactions during at least the first part of 1977, nor will
                            the Jordanian program. Egypt needs additional weapons both for military
                            balance and political purposes—but there is only a slim likelihood of
                            obtaining Congressional approval in 1977 for most of the items and
                            quantities that it would like to acquire from the US.</p>

                            <p>—It would obviate the need to make early Executive Branch decisions
                                and stimulate Congressional debate on arms requests from Israel and
                                the Arab states (particularly Egypt) which could prejudice the
                                ability of the United States to retain the trust of both sides
                                during a period of intensive effort to make further progress toward
                                a Middle East peace settlement. [If Israel’s requests were approved
                                while Arab requests were not, it would probably have a negative
                                impact on US ability to induce either Israel or the Arabs to move

                            <p>—We would have served notice that the United States is no longer
                                willing to approve virtually unlimited military sales to the Middle
                                East without some progress toward a settlement, and (by keeping the
                                term of the pause indefinite) we would provide additional impetus
                                for the movement toward that goal.</p>
                            <p>—There is a unique but temporary opportunity as the Administration
                                changes: a pause can be justified as necessary study/review time
                                with less of a negative impact on bilateral relations; to do it
                                later will necessarily be interpreted as signal of major change of
                                policy.</p>
                            <p>—We would provide essential breathing spell for policy review and
                                formulation without insistent day-to-day pressures for action on
                                specific requests; would provide clean slate for conscious,
                                long-term policy direction and a chance to impose a distinctive
                                stamp on the choice of objectives, keeping what is good without
                                muddling through with bits and pieces of inherited institutional
                                assumptions and methods. Otherwise, the new Administration will soon
                                be caught up in ad hoc actions which will define policy direction by
                                establishing precedents.</p>
                            <p>—It would come at a time when a wealth of experience and background
                                data is available within the Executive Branch for meaningful
                                analysis, with considerable leg work already done; the bureaucracy
                                is in a receptive mood for a thorough reappraisal, and there should
                                be no major obstacles to conducting a useful and realistic policy
                                study.</p>
                            <p>—It would be consistent with President-elect <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s stated position and will
                                be a distinct plus with Congress and the public, who are eager for
                                action in the control of arms supply to foreign countries.</p>
                            <p>—It will reduce pressures to raise Israel’s <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                    >FMS</gloss> level from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion for <gloss

                                $1.0).</p>

                            <p>—It is bound to generate unduly high expectations among those who
                                oppose arms sales, which would be difficult to fulfill since the
                                conclusions of policy review may not support drastic
                                restrictions.</p>
                            <p>—It will do some damage to our bilateral relations with countries
                                such as Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia who have pending requests
                                awaiting approval, and to Egypt which is expected to make requests
                                shortly after January 20. There could be a tendency on the part of
                                these countries to turn to other arms suppliers, either the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> or Western Europe. The Arab
                                reaction would be mitigated were the pause in new approvals clearly
                                extended to Israel; the Iranian reaction would be more difficult to
                                mitigate and could lead to more military procurement from the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and possibly to a less
                                sympathetic attitude toward US military facilities in Iran.</p>
                            <p>—Of the confrontation states, the pause would apply primarily to
                                Israel and to a lesser degree to Jordan. We could be accused of
                                punishing Israel unfairly while the Syrians, for example, continued
                                to receive arms from the Soviets. Recent publicity about the
                                possible sale of French Mirage fighters to Egypt will reinforce this
                                reaction; if the sale goes through. Israel and its supporters will
                                also charge that the US is not standing by its previous arms
                                commitments (to sell the F–16, for example) and by campaign promises
                                not to apply pressure on Israel, alleging that all affected states,
                                except Israel, have alternative sources of supply <pb facs="0204"
                                    n="169" xml:id="pg_169"/> and that the pause is a disguised
                                effort to force Israel to make undesirable negotiating
                                concessions.</p>
                            <p>—Once such a pause is declared, a decision on how and when to resume
                                deliveries becomes a major political act. It will be difficult to
                                decide upon a time and criteria for resumed sales that will not have
                                drawbacks from the standpoint of our relations with one or more
                                countries and possibly also from the standpoint of our peacemaking
                                efforts.</p>

                        <p>Prior to any public announcement, the Administration should consult with
                            the nations most directly affected by the new policy and with the
                            Congress. A basic approach is outlined below.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Israeli leadership should be notified shortly before the planned
                            announcement, making the following points:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—A major policy review of arms transfers to the Middle East and
                                Persian Gulf is required, and no new decisions on arms transfers to
                                these areas can be made until it is completed. We expect it to
                                require several months and certainly less than a year.</p>
                            <p>—If a pause were declared only for the Arab states and Iran and not
                                Israel, we would be accused of partiality and the possibility of
                                progress toward a negotiated settlement could be severely
                                compromised. As it is, the pause can contribute to the peace
                                process.</p>
                            <p>—Israel is very well prepared to defend itself against any short-term
                                threat from the Arabs and its military security should not be
                                impaired by a pause in new orders.</p>
                            <p>—Previous commitments (including the four items) will not be affected
                                by the moratorium, and the flow of spare parts and ammunition will
                                continue. Israel will not be penalized by delayed delivery times due
                                to the pause.</p>
                            <p>—The pause will only be temporary, and it would be terminated at any
                                time if there is a major shift in the military balance or some new
                                threat to Israel’s security.</p>
                            <p>—The US will make efforts to have the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"

                                our long-term relationship. In view of the growing criticism in the
                                United States on this issue, Iran’s long-term interest in security
                                cooperation with the United States can best be protected by the
                                development and articulation of a policy which has greater public

                            [There is pending a French-Egyptian agreement involving the early sale

                            additional 200 F–1s—a striking parallel to the Israeli proposal to the
                            US for early sale of 50 F–16 fighters and later co-production of 200
                            F–16s. It is possible that a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            initiative involving at least a temporary freeze on the F–16s for Israel
                            could induce the French to delay for a corresponding period the F–1s for
                            Egypt, thereby slowing down the Middle East arms race.]</p>
                        <p>In the Soviet case, advance consultation could be used to try and

                            arms transactions would be fully consistent with their interests and
                            their publicly stated concern over the arms buildup in these two
                            areas.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Over the past several years, sales of United States military equipment
                            and services to other nations has averaged nearly $10 billion per year.
                            A considerable proportion of these sales has gone to the Middle East.
                            Last year alone, the nations of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf
                            ordered a total of more than $5 billion of military goods and services
                            from this country through commercial channels and by
                            government-to-government agreements under the Foreign Military Sales
                            Act. The present undelivered balance of defense contracts with these
                            nations totals more than $22 billion, and the delivery of these orders
                            will extend over many years to come.</p>
                        <p>I know that this situation has been a matter of concern to the Congress
                            and the US people, and I believe this would be an appropriate time to
                            pause for a period of consolidation and reflection. Specifically, I wish
                            to review the military supply situation for these regions in the context
                            of the peace and stability and security which we and our friends in the
                            Middle East and Persian Gulf are committed to achieving. I want to
                            ensure that the American contributions of matériel, technical assistance
                            training and other military-related services serve the goals of peace
                            and that our decisions on these issues are compatible with the broader
                            foreign policy objectives of this Administration.</p>
                        <p>To this end, I have directed the State Department to head an interagency
                            task force to examine the political, strategic and security aspects of
                            arms transfers to the Middle East and Persian Gulf including the
                            possibility of an eventual international agreement on this subject.
                            While this study is underway, no requests for major weapons will be
                            approved and forwarded to Congress. This will not affect firm agreements
                            already concluded, or deliveries of spare parts, training and other
                            services, nor will it affect in any way the close associations which
                            have developed <pb facs="0207" n="172" xml:id="pg_172"/> between the
                            nations of the Middle East and Persian Gulf and the United States. I am
                            satisfied that the present prospects in both regions are for movement
                            toward peace rather than conflict and a temporary pause in new arms
                            sales agreements can only make the environment more favorable for peace.
                            I am also satisfied that the security of those nations with whom we have
                            long had a close relationship in the security field will not be
                            threatened by this pause. Should a new threat to any of our friends
                            arise, we would naturally be prepared to help them by approving new
                            requests.</p>
                        <p>The temporary pause is intended to give myself and my Administration the
                            opportunity to examine this very complex area of our foreign policy and,
                            in close consultation with the Congress, to establish a coherent and
                            carefully formulated set of guidelines to serve as the basis for future
                            decisions. I consider this particularly important at the present
                            time.</p>

                            delivered orally:</p>
                        <p>2. Iraqi-Kuwaiti border first agreed upon in 1932. Further agreement
                            implementing 1932 understanding was signed in 1963 by current President
                            Bakr for Iraq and Amir Sabah of Kuwait. <gloss target="#t_GOK_1"

                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> Sabah to Iraq. Kuwaitis
                            at that time received assurances from Baghdad that top echelons of
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> had taken note of Kuwaiti
                            interest in border question and that subject would be further discussed
                            within several weeks when Iraqi delegation would come to Kuwait.</p>
                        <p>3. Kuwaitis were happy when told <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>
                            ready to discuss border issue, but in fact Iraqis continued to build
                            road and commit other violations of frontier. Showing great
                            forebearance, Kuwait continued avoid clash.</p>
                        <pb facs="0209" n="174" xml:id="pg_174"/>
                        <p>4. Kuwait has five posts from west to east along border with Iraq. The
                            two stations involved in today’s attack were posts on sea at Umm Qasr
                            (just south of Iraqi base which also in Umm Qasr area), and post at
                            al-Sumtah, four or five kilometers to the west. For some months Iraqis
                            have been building roads in Kuwaiti territory at al-Sumtah. Despite this
                            provocation, Kuwait reacted calmly and reasonably. Kuwait not interested
                            in making enemies but in peaceful development and friendship.</p>
                        <p>5. At 3:20 a.m., Mar 20, Iraqi forces attacked al-Sumtah. Of 20 men,
                            lightly armed, police garrison, one officer reported killed, four
                            wounded and about eight missing. <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss>
                            has requested Iraqi force withdraw immediately, surrender Kuwaiti
                            prisoners, and deal with matter across negotiating table, not with guns.
                            Kuwaiti information is, however, that Iraqis intend occupy second post
                            at Umm Qasr which was also attacked this morning with artillery fire.
                            Kuwaiti forces have been moved to border area and will defend Umm Qasr
                            post if necessary.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> wants to solve dispute peacefully
                            and still prepared do so. Kuwaiti radio refraining from provocative
                            statements. Nevertheless Kuwait entitled defend its territory and will
                            do so. Kuwait hopes reason will prevail. It has conveyed its viewpoint
                            to all Arab capitals and requests that all friends of Kuwait lend
                            support and use their influence to convince Kuwait’s neighbor to north
                            to avoid further unreasonable action. Kuwait also wants world to know
                            that all demonstrations have [garble—been?] prohibited in Kuwait and
                            that measures have been taken by Kuwaiti security forces to protect all
                            Iraqis living in Kuwait. End of Under Sec’s remarks.</p>
                        <p>7. Note: Iraqi radio has just broadcast following announcement: <gloss

                            aggression was originally initiated by Kuwaiti forces against Iraqi
                            forces which were carrying out their normal training in that area

                        <p>Summary: <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> told Ambassador March
                            26 that Iraqis had offered come Kuwait to discuss border situation about
                            April 8 but <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> seeking earlier
                            arrival. Sabah believed Soviets involved in Iraqi moves. Kuwaitis
                            pleased at support of small Gulf States, but irritated with Saudis who
                            only expressed regret. Ambassador urged that Kuwait and lower Gulf
                            states join together to protect themselves from obvious growing dangers
                            from north and south. Sabah agreed that more joint cooperation among
                            small Gulf states essential. Ambassador also urged Kuwaiti assistance to
                            Oman and suggested that threat to Oman should also be seen by Kuwait as
                            a danger to itself and stability of area, similar to threat from Iraq.
                            Sabah asked that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> expedite sending
                            military items requested by <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss>. End
                            summary.</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> Sabah received me at my
                            request March 26. In answer my questions, he gave details on present
                            border situation with Iraq along lines we have reported in other tels.
                            He said Iraqis had offered come to Kuwait to discuss border about April
                            8 but <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> had replied requesting
                            earlier meeting and demanding know why delay. Sabah said <gloss

                            1963 agreement had not been answered by <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss>, but Kuwaitis confident of general Arab support as
                            injured party if <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> forced take
                            problem further, including to Arab League.</p>

                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> said <gloss
                                target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> persuaded Soviets had hand in Iraqi
                            move. He had just seen Soviet Ambassador (who was departing Ministry as
                            I entered) and asked him report <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss>’s
                            request that <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> restrain its
                            protegé.</p>
                        <p>3. I told Sabah <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had thought it best
                            not issue public statement on Kuwaiti-Iraqi’s border problem. He replied
                            he agreed silence best but <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could
                            help by expediting military items requested. I told him military
                            requirements sent me by <gloss target="#t_MinDef_1">MinDef</gloss>
                            [garble—were?] already en route Washington (septels).</p>
                        <p>4. Referring to several recent commentaries in local press, I asked Sabah
                            whether as result Iraqi attack <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss>
                            might not be feeling bit lonely. Did he think traditional policy of
                            being friends of all and yet having no friends in time of need would now
                            come under review? Sabah was not willing acknowledge failure of
                            “neutralist” Kuwaiti policies, but he was clearly receptive to
                            discussing subject. He was especially irritated with Saudis whose only
                            reaction to date had been message sent through Saudi <gloss
                                target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> here expressing regret for incident
                            “which is contrary to Arabism and Islam.” Other small Gulf states
                            however had been prompt in offering full cooperation including use of
                            their airfields and other facilities. <gloss target="#t_GOK_1"
                                >GOK</gloss> said been very pleased and gratified by this
                            response.</p>
                        <p>5. I commented it my personal view lesson to be learned was that Kuwait
                            and lower Gulf states could go on acting alone, as though all world owed
                            them their existence, and in end be swallowed up one by one; or could
                            join together to protect themselves. If they chose latter course, they
                            could be respected power in their own right.</p>
                        <p>Kuwait, I said, would have great deal to offer such a grouping, and I was
                            sure there were rulers, especially Khalifa of Qatar and Isa of Bahrain,
                            who would be receptive to idea. No outsiders likely to be respectful or
                            helpful if Gulf states unable show they could put own house in order.
                            Right now they were tasty and tempting morsels to bigger fish, like
                            Kuwait to Iraq.</p>
                        <p>6. Sabah did not take issue. In fact, he said, Kuwait had initiated new
                            contacts with lower Gulf and Oman and these would be expanded. Much
                            more, he conceded, needed to be done. He was especially worried, he
                            said, about Oman where inexperienced Sultan not in touch with his
                            people, surrounded by British expatriates, and wasting his money on
                            fighting handful of people in Dhofar instead of developing his country.
                            Was it good thing that Iranians and Saudis had entered scene and were
                            stirring it up?</p>
                        <p>7. I told Sabah he had it wrong. Qaboos was indeed inexperienced but he
                            trying hard, with long legacy of utter neglect of country under his
                            father. Qaboos had two problems: costly defense of country which after
                            all under attack by neighboring communist regime of <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> and <pb facs="0212" n="177"
                                xml:id="pg_177"/> at same time trying to engender some economic and
                            social progress in far-flung and backward country. He badly needed help.
                            If Kuwait did not like Iran-Saudi role, what was Kuwait doing to make it
                            unnecessary? If Kuwait could take full honest look at area, it might
                            discover danger to itself from south (Aden) as well as north. It might
                            realize that Oman’s struggle was Kuwait’s problem too, only a few miles
                            removed. Kuwait should understand predicament Qaboos was in. For all its
                            enlightened policies toward other countries, Kuwait had now discovered
                            that some people do not play game according to rules. Now ever Kuwait
                            finds it must defend itself. If all Gulf states came to conclusion that
                            Kuwait’s problem with present Iraqi regime and Oman’s problem with
                                <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> regime were fundamentally one
                            and same, their chances of survival would be measurably improved. I
                            added US had very important selfish interest in welfare of Gulf states
                            as well. We get our oil from this region.</p>
                        <p>8. Sabah said he would welcome further discussions of this sort. In
                            meantime <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> urgently requesting US
                            help with weapons Kuwait now needs to strengthen its armed forces.</p>

                        <p>(S) Ambassador Sabah said his purpose in coming was to make a courtesy
                            call on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> and to meet
                            his staff. In the interest of continuing the good relations between the
                            two countries, he wanted us to feel free to consult his Embassy at any
                            time. He mentioned the military team the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> is sending to Kuwait shortly. In response to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>’ questions about the
                            team, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> said it would be
                            headed by Colonel Kelly, who also headed the team last year. Mr.
                            Timberlake added that the team would leave on 15 April for Kuwait, would
                            consist of about six to eight members, and would be in Kuwait for about
                            a week.</p>
                        <p>(S) Ambassador Sabah said the second purpose of his visit was to inform
                            us about the situation between his country and Iraq. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> said that Kuwait has been a
                            balancing factor in its part of the world and that he admired the way
                            Kuwait has handled its affairs. He noted his own extensive experiences
                            and many friends in Kuwait. He asked how the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> could help Kuwait.</p>
                        <p>(S) Ambassador Sabah replied that he hoped the problem between Kuwait and
                            Iraq would be solved diplomatically. Iraqi representatives were due in
                            Kuwait that weekend. Through the active mediation efforts of Egypt,
                            Syria, the Arab League, and, especially, <persName corresp="#p_AY_2"
                                >Yasir Arafat</persName>, he felt the talks would succeed. If they
                            failed, Kuwait would take the issue to the Arab League. If that failed,
                            Kuwait would turn to its friends for help. That is why Kuwait wanted to
                            inform its friends.</p>
                        <p>(S) Ambassador Sabah then turned to the Arab-Israeli problem. He was glad
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> intended to
                            place greater emphasis on the Middle East. Kuwait has good relations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, and so do some other Arab
                            states. Some Arab states, however, do not. It would greatly strengthen
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position in the Middle East,
                            and strengthen Kuwait as well, if the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> would help restore the balance in the Middle East and
                            achieve a just and lasting settlement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName> replied that the Arab-Israeli problem had been
                            going on for some time and that he thought Kuwait’s immediate problem
                            transcended that. He felt the two problems were separate. If the Saudis
                            found themselves in Kuwait’s predicament, they would be more specific.
                            Ambassador Sabah replied that Kuwait is an Arab country and involved in
                            the Arab world; it is affected by general Arab problems and has forces
                            along the Suez Canal. A just settlement, he reiterated, would strengthen
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position in the Middle
                            East.</p>
                        <p>(S) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> asked the
                            Ambassador if he really thought the mediation effort would succeed in
                            getting Iraq to yield. The Ambassador said yes; Iraq had counted on
                            Kuwait’s weakness to enable it to succeed. Instead, Kuwait had shown
                            great firmness; and the people, <pb facs="0214" n="179" xml:id="pg_179"
                            /> half of whom are non-Kuwaitis, had shown themselves solidly behind
                            the government. It is also in the interest of the mediators,
                            particularly <persName corresp="#p_AY_2">Arafat</persName>, to obtain a
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>(S) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> said that he was
                            not surprised to hear of the loyalty shown by the Kuwaiti people. He was
                            pleased to receive the Ambassador’s optimistic views. He himself had
                            been more concerned. The Ambassador replied that it was his job to be
                            optimistic. He was prepared, however, to take a plane to Kuwait on
                            Sunday if the mediation effort failed.</p>

                        <p>Now that our agreement in principle to sell F–4s has been conveyed to
                            Saudi Arabia, the question of F–4s for Kuwait needs to be addressed. You
                            will recall that we suggested separating this from the Saudi decision so
                            you would have more time to think about it. The State Department is now
                            seeking clearance of the attached cable informing Kuwait of our
                            agreement in principle to sell them F–4s.</p>
                        <pb facs="0215" n="180" xml:id="pg_180"/>
                        <p>This decision is more difficult than the decision on Saudi Arabia. The
                            pros and cons are spelled out in greater detail below, but, in brief,
                                <hi rend="italic">the argument hinges on these two points:</hi></p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—On the one hand, our interests in Kuwait are less important than in
                                Saudi Arabia; Kuwait has less of a regional role to play and less
                                obvious military need for F–4s; Kuwaiti foreign policy has, until
                                recently, been somewhat erratic; and Kuwait has not had the special
                                relationship with the US that justifies selling Phantoms to Israel,
                                Iran, Turkey and now Saudi Arabia.</p>
                            <p>—On the other hand, the recent Iraqi attack on Kuwaiti border posts
                                and Iraqi territorial demands appear to have led Kuwaiti leaders to
                                a fundamental reappraisal of their head-in-the-sand foreign policy.
                                They turned immediately to us for military equipment, which we are
                                selling, and this opens an opportunity for us to tie them more
                                firmly into a system of states friendly to us.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>In greater detail, the following are the <hi rend="italic">advantages of
                                agreement</hi> in principle:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—Kuwait appears to be at an important stage in the evolution of its
                                foreign policy. Strong US political support, as demonstrated by
                                agreement to sell F–4s, could be an important factor in bringing
                                Kuwait within the orbit of states more closely related to us than to
                                the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. This could be an
                                important step in building up the US presence in the Gulf at a time
                                when the Soviets are concentrating on building their own presence in
                                the Gulf.</p>
                            <p>—The Kuwaitis are presently trying to strengthen their air defense
                                capabilities and are on the verge of signing letters of offer for
                                nearly $500 million of US military equipment and services, including
                                32 F–8 Crusader aircraft. The Kuwaiti decision on F–8s, however, may
                                depend upon assurances that eventually they will be able to graduate
                                to the F–4.</p>
                            <p>—Actual delivery will be several years off. One squadron more or less
                                of F–4s in the Persian Gulf area will not have a decisive military
                                impact, especially when one assumes it will not be used very
                                effectively in the foreseeable future.</p>
                            <p>—There is a real possibility that Kuwait will buy Mirage IIIs and
                                subsequently Mirage F–1s if we do not agree in principle now to sell
                                F–4s. This has two aspects: (1) they will get sophisticated aircraft
                                anyway; (2) the French would very much like to break the strong
                                American position in Persian Gulf oil. Admittedly, Mirages in Kuwait
                                would not be as bad as MIGs and the Soviet presence they would
                                bring; but if we are talking about strengthening the US presence in
                                the Gulf, this is a significant opportunity and vehicle.</p>
                            <p>—By agreeing to sell F–4s to Kuwait, we will be able to establish a
                                relationship with the Kuwaiti military that will to some extent
                                enhance our influence in Kuwaiti military decisions and over the end
                                use of the equipment through the control of spare parts. US
                                influence, however limited, should serve the interests of Israel,
                                Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Iran better than French influence.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>The following are the <hi rend="italic">disadvantages</hi> of agreeing to
                            provide F–4s to Kuwait:</p>
                        <pb facs="0216" n="181" xml:id="pg_181"/>
                        <p>—The factor that has to be taken most seriously is that the Israelis will
                            object sharply to any move that puts Phantoms into Arab hands. While the
                            numbers are small and any deliveries are at least 3–4 years off, the
                            Israelis will read this as somehow a diminution of their favored status.
                            Their alternative, however, is French influence and behavior, to be
                            considered against the background of Libya’s recent transfer of Mirages
                            to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>—One cannot at all exclude that these planes would be transferred to the
                            front lines in an Arab-Israeli confrontation, although again that is at
                            least 3–4 years away at the earliest. Kuwait is extremely vulnerable to
                            pressure from the radical Arab states. The US could cut off spare parts,
                            but the planes might operate for a limited period.</p>
                        <p>—Coming in the wake of our decision to strengthen the defenses of Jordan,
                            Saudi Arabia and even Lebanon, agreement to sell F–4s to Kuwait will be
                            seen as part of an overall upgrading of Arab military capabilities.
                            While this decision in itself will not affect the Arab-Israeli military
                            balance soon, its symbolic importance in the eyes of Arabs and Israelis
                            may be significant. If nothing else, it may contribute to the illusion
                            of growing Arab power, which could lead to poor judgments on the part of
                            Arab military men. It also suggests that the US is so concerned by the
                            energy crisis that it is embarking on a crash program to arm its
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>—The Soviets would see this as a further sudden deepening of US
                            involvement in the Gulf and might in turn seek to strengthen their own
                            activities in the area, via Iraq in particular. The Soviets, however,
                            appear to be going ahead with a substantial buildup in Iraqi military
                            capabilities without reference to our military programs in the Arabian
                            Peninsula.</p>
                        <p>—Even with F–4s, Kuwait will not be strong enough by itself to resist
                            Iraqi pressures.</p>
                        <p>—The F–4 does not make much sense in Kuwait. It is a sophisticated
                            aircraft which the Kuwaitis may find difficult to operate
                            effectively.</p>
                        <p>—Selling to Kuwait may make it difficult to refuse to provide F–4s for
                            Jordan and Lebanon.</p>
                        <p>State and Defense recommend strongly that Kuwait be informed now that we
                            are prepared in principle to offer the F–4 as a follow-on to the F–8.
                            Training and manpower requirements will be discussed, and it will be
                            made clear to Kuwait that deliveries of F–4s could not begin for several
                            years. The offer of F–4s would assume that Kuwait will not undertake a
                            Mirage program as well.</p>
                        <p>It should be recognized that a decision on F–4s for Kuwait is at this
                            stage largely a political gesture. It is tempting to call it a
                            “marginal” political gesture since Kuwait will still have a political
                            incentive to <pb facs="0217" n="182" xml:id="pg_182"/> keep its lines
                            out to France and other European countries in order to avoid being too
                            closely associated with us and our Arab-Israeli policy. However, the
                            present situation provides an opportunity to consolidate a significant
                            change in Kuwait’s orientation. In the context of our broader interest
                            in upgrading our position in the Gulf, this cannot be lightly dismissed.
                            Providing an American weapons system as the core of Kuwait’s air
                            defense—along with our position in Iran and Saudi Arabia—would quickly
                            give us the dominant role in supplying the military forces of three of
                            the four principal Gulf nations.</p>
                        <p>In a completely rational world we would not be selling this kind of
                            equipment to a country like Kuwait, but Kuwait is going to get the
                            equipment and the French are not going to hesitate to supply it. The US
                            has a substantial stake in the Gulf, and the French have an interest in
                            undercutting our oil position there, so there is an argument for
                            competing. The Israelis will object, but their alternatives have to be
                            considered. This decision will have no effect whatsoever on the military
                            balance for the next four years or so and then it will be minimal. In
                            any case, our interest is to attend to our position in the Gulf and to
                            keep it as separate as possible from the Arab-Israeli impasse. Besides,
                            a US military influence in Kuwait serves Israel’s interests far better
                            than a French influence.</p>
                        <p>Although it is hard to be enthusiastic, on balance it seems desirable to
                            go ahead with this decision in principle to provide F–4s.</p>

                        <p>Since we sent you the memo at Tab B on F–4s for Kuwait, the Kuwaiti
                            request has become somewhat less clear and the sense of urgency within
                            our bureaucracy more intense. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName> has sent you an appeal [Tab A] to approve a
                            somewhat more general statement on follow-on aircraft to the Government
                            of Kuwait.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recent Developments</p>
                        <p>It is now apparent that the Kuwaitis are not explicitly asking for the
                            F–4 as a follow-on aircraft to the F–8, which they are now considering
                            as a stop-gap measure to provide some immediate air defense capability.
                            Increasingly the Kuwaitis seem to be interested in purchasing two
                            distinct types of aircraft—an interceptor, perhaps the F–5E that at one
                            time they rejected; and a ground attack or close support aircraft, such
                            as the A–4, A–7, or eventually the A–10. The Kuwaitis are sending a team
                            to the United States to look at all of these possibilities.</p>
                        <p>We cannot preclude, of course, that they will ultimately only be
                            interested in the F–4. If that proves to be the case, the arguments we
                            made in our previous memo remain valid. But it seems possible that the
                            Kuwaitis may genuinely prefer two simpler aircraft rather than the more
                            complicated F–4.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What to Tell the Kuwaitis Now</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> has proposed avoiding
                            the issue of the F–4 now by telling the Kuwaitis that we are willing to
                            offer for sale a “suitable, mutually agreed, advanced follow-on
                            aircraft” to the F–8 now under consideration. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName> concurs in this recommendation.
                            The full statement that they recommend is as follows:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>“The Government of the United States is willing to offer for sale to
                                the Government of Kuwait suitable, mutually agreed, advanced
                                follow-on aircraft. These aircraft would be made available as the
                                result of Kuwait experience with interim US aircraft and in
                                conjunction with United States recommendations regarding pilot and
                                maintenance training to provide Kuwait with the capability to absorb
                                sophisticated follow-on aircraft.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Issue</p>
                        <p>The broader issues remain as stated in our earlier memo at Tab B. We have
                            a strong interest in assisting in the defense of Kuwait especially now
                            that Kuwait has turned to us for help and in tying it more closely to
                            our other friends in the area. It will be more difficult to involve
                            Saudi Arabia and Jordan in Kuwait’s defense if they see us participating
                            only half-heartedly. On the other hand, at this early stage in the
                            evolution of Kuwait’s defense and foreign policies, it seems premature
                            to get locked into promising the F–4.</p>
                        <p>If the more general statement above is approved, it will not commit us to
                            any particular future course of action. But it will commit us to doing
                            something, and we should have in mind what we would be willing to
                            provide for Kuwait. Two possibilities exist:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—A follow-on package, consisting of some combination of ground attack
                                aircraft and interceptors (e.g., A–4, A–7, A–10, F–5E).</p>
                            <p>—A follow-on package which would include F–4s.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>At some point we will have to tell the Kuwaitis which of these options
                            they can count on. Our choices are essentially the following:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—Say nothing for now.</p>
                            <p>—Approve a vague statement as recommended by <persName

                            Concluding, he remarked that <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> needs
                            continued US friendship and friendly assistance in development. I
                            thanked Suwaidi for his remarks and assured him <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> recognizes mutuality of benefits from close relations

                            differences on approach so long as common bonds and interests exist on

                                >Zayid</persName> and journalist and this, coupled with effort to
                            make good story better, had resulted in distortion of <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName>’s views.</p>
                        <p>5. Ghubash said <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> expressed
                            two major ideas: (A) Oil-rich Arab states should assist those without
                            oil revenues, but help should not be random or haphazard. Arab states
                            should get together to establish channels for allocation of funds on
                            rational basis. (B) Oil can serve as important means of promoting
                            understanding of Arab, and specifically <gloss target="#t_UAE_1"
                                >UAE</gloss>, policy. Re energy crisis, Ghubash said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> explained that, as Arab and
                            Muslim, it not possible for him take undue advantage of situation and,
                            as far as US concerned, <gloss target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> does

                        <p>6. Ghubash said he interrupted, as reported para 1 <gloss

                            question by saying that, as Arab and under those circumstances, he would
                            have no choice but to follow suit.</p>
                        <p>7. Ghubash asked that I convey his clarification to <gloss

                            but admitted he had not had chance discuss question with <persName

                            course, relay it to Washington. I added that I had not yet seen original
                            interview but had naturally drawn attention of Dept to item which

                            pending clarification.</p>

                            however, bringing subject into open. Suwaidi has spent last several days
                            in close consultation with <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"
                                >Zayid</persName> and news of my request for appt reached him while
                            he still in <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName>’s company.
                            Whether it was anticipated that in under instructions raise subject or
                            not, we shall probably never know, but assume <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> and Suwaidi probably
                            considered how best deal with possibility <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> reaction. Have also recently heard radio accounts of
                            interview by same Lebanese magazine with King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> in Saudi Arabia in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> reportedly critical
                            of those who urge use of oil itself rather than oil revenues in support
                            of Arab cause. <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> could be
                            expected to be sensitive to this kind of criticism of position he
                            alleged to have taken.</p>
                        <p>9. In fact, it out of character for <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"
                                >Zayid</persName> and <gloss target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> to get
                            out in front on so sensitive an issue. <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"
                                >Zayid</persName> undoubtedly sought in interview protect himself
                            against attacks on his dedication to Arabism, but probably did not
                            expect to find himself widely quoted as primary architect of oil
                            boycott. Having made what he regards as proper noises, there evidence

                                >U.S.</gloss> and Bahrain to continue same close relations as in

                        <p>2. When Chargé called on Amir Nov 13, Shaikh Isa said he wanted, as
                            before October War, closest relations with <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> He said he was most unhappy about <gloss

                            this action. He spoke somewhat scornfully of fears and excitement which
                            gripped some of Ministers at meeting when decision was made. Prominent
                            among his targets was <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> Shaikh
                            Muhammad.</p>
                        <p>3. Amir also expressed contempt for Iraqis whom he said threatened to
                            bomb Bahrain International Airport if latter was used by those aiding
                            Israel. Regarding brief street demonstration during war, he pointed out
                            to Iraqi Ambassador that slogans marchers were using came from Iraq.
                            Ambassador vehemently denied any bad intentions. Amir observed to Chargé
                            that he did not care what others thought. He would say and do what he
                            thought best for Bahrain’s interests.</p>
                        <p>4. In Amir’s mind <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> notice to Navy is
                            by no means final. He indicated without elaboration that problem would
                            be worked out and Navy could continue here as before. To try to draw him
                            out more, Chargé said <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>-supported
                            Bahrain school would almost surely have to close when Navy departed and
                            some hard decisions on new arrangements would have to be made soon. Amir
                            replied simply that school should be told to continue as it has been.
                            Make no changes.</p>

                        <p>5. Amir’s comments and those of his brother PriMin Shaikh Khalifa (<gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>) suggest they are determined to

                            confident of being able to manage any internal opponents, including
                            those who might gain seats in Bahrain’s first elected parliament in
                            December, and seem to be waiting and hoping for helpful developments in
                            Arab-Israeli crisis before showing their hand.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">KUWAIT: Possible Pressure Points</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are only limited ways in which the United States could apply
                            pressure on the Kuwaitis. We have no economic or military assistance
                            programs in Kuwait. Although Kuwait’s economy, perhaps more than any
                            other in the world, is trade oriented and almost totally dependent on
                            the importation of goods and services, the United States’ 12% share of
                            this market—although significant—is not crucial to Kuwait. The
                            industrial items, consumer durables, and small amounts of grains and
                            foodstuffs we sell Kuwait can all be replaced by competing goods from
                            Europe and Japan. The medium-size American community (about 1100) is
                            almost entirely business and oil-oriented. Its departure would not have
                            much of an impact on the economy or the country’s oil operations. (There
                            are only five or six American oilmen in key executive positions.)
                            Therefore, any pressure unilaterally applied by the United States is
                            unlikely to have any effect other than to increase the sense of anger
                            and frustration Kuwaitis feel over our policies in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>The ability for the United States to apply an effective pressure is also
                            limited by the fact that Kuwait, because of its small size, great
                            wealth, large Palestinian population, and resultant vulnerability must
                                <pb facs="0226" n="191" xml:id="pg_191"/> maintain good relations
                            with all the larger Arab states. It must stay carefully in step within
                            the mainstream of Arab political thinking. Especially in response to
                            unilateral American pressure, it could not afford to pursue policies on
                            pan-Arab or Arab-Israel issues which were independent of the consensus
                            of large Arab states.</p>
                        <p>The following is a list of possible pressures we might exercise in the

                        <p>1. At recent encounter with Yemeni <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                            Qubati, Chargé mentioned to him report from our <gloss target="#t_Emb_1"
                                >Emb</gloss> in Sana’a about desire of <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> Commander-in-Chief to move ahead on Abu Dhabi-financed
                            arms procurement deal with US. Inquired of Qubati if he aware present
                            state of financing commitment.</p>
                        <p>2. Qubati acknowledged that Yemeni military actively clamoring for modern
                            arms, but he gave me definite impression that <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> not pressing <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"
                                >Zayid</persName> for funds at this time because of area situation,
                            and especially, high state of his irritation with US. Qubati said he
                            felt deal, as far as Abu Dhabi concerned, shelved for time being as
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> unwilling have it be
                            known that he purchasing US arms for Arab country, which wants them for
                            defense against hostile Arab state. Furthermore, <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> recognizes that commitments to Arab
                            combatants have strained <gloss target="#t_AD_1">AD</gloss>’s reserves.
                            Also gained impression from Qubati’s uncharacteristic questioning of
                            rationale behind US policy severely limiting sale of arms to Arab
                            states, that <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> may have
                            sounded off to Yemeni <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> over
                            difficulty [garble] has had in obtaining certain military hardware items
                            from US over past year and half. On other hand, Qubati may also have
                            been reflecting frustration of <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>
                            over its failure to convince US of need for larger or more sophisticated
                            arms package.</p>
                        <p>3. Do not intend to raise matter of US financing of arms for Yemen with
                                <gloss target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> or <persName

                        </list>
                        <p>Recent events in the Middle East have reinforced the validity of
                            maintaining a flexible military presence in the Arabian Sea area. The
                            Bahraini Government decision to expel the homeported Middle East Force
                            flagship was a direct reflection of relatively cohesive Arab bloc
                            pressure directed against regional <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            interests. In order that we may move ahead expeditiously in the
                            development of alternative support options for continued flexibility of
                            operations in that area, I seek your support for the proposal that we
                            proceed through our embassies in Tehran and Addis Ababa to examine
                            feasibility and, if feasible, to seek authority to conduct surveys of
                            most promising sites for homeporting one to two destroyer size
                            ships.</p>
                        <p>I consider an investigation of this alternative necessary for two
                            reasons, even if the Bahraini Government ultimately reverses its
                            decision on the Stationing Agreement. First, acquisition of an
                            alternative homeport location would improve the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> bargaining position should we be afforded the
                            opportunity to renegotiate for access to Bahrain. Secondly, in the
                            eventuality that the Middle East Force is increased in size, additional
                            homeport facilities would be necessary for one to two ships to avoid
                            overtaxing limited facilities in Bahrain.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, in reviewing that portion of the NSSM–110 follow-on that
                            addressed our <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1972 Indian Ocean naval
                            presence, the Senior Review Group agreed to qualitative and quantitative
                            upgrading of the Middle East Force, periodic <gloss target="#t_CVCVA_1"
                                >CV</gloss> deployments and random maritime patrols as an adequate
                            counter-balance to Soviet naval presence in the Indian Ocean. This
                            underscores the requirement for a continuing and <pb facs="0231" n="196"
                                xml:id="pg_196"/> effective Middle East Force presence in the
                            region. Considerations governing this decision, e.g., the importance of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests in the region plus
                            Soviet naval presence, have become more significant since the decision
                            was made.</p>
                        <p>The Navy has undertaken a comprehensive examination of operational
                            alternatives available while keeping in mind the mission of the Middle
                            East Force. As you are aware, this mission involves support of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> objectives in the Middle East and
                            Indian Ocean by maintaining a presence centered around the Persian
                            Gulf/Red Sea area but extending into the Indian Ocean as far as Sri
                            Lanka. The options considered included:</p>
                        <p>—Afloat presence with negotiated base and airfield use rights.</p>
                        <p>—Anchoring in an area which affords proximate air support facilities.</p>
                        <p>—Homeporting the Middle East Force elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>In the first instance, an afloat presence is not feasible for maintaining
                            a continuous presence considering the extended deployment times required
                            and the limited ship assets available to devote to a rotational
                            schedule. The same problem is encountered in the second option including
                            the added liability of limited shore support. Homeporting a portion of
                            the Middle East Force ships continues to offer the most viable option
                            for continuation of an effective Navy presence.</p>
                        <p>A variety of potential homeporting sites has been considered. They
                            include Assab and Massawa in Ethiopia, various ports in Iran,
                            Victoria/Mahe Seychelles, Port Louis Mauritius, Diego Garcia and
                            Karachi, Pakistan. For a variety of reasons, which include political
                            considerations, the availability of support facilities and operational
                            time-distance factors, the majority of these ports are considered
                            unacceptable. The principal exceptions are Massawa in Ethiopia and
                            Bandar Abbas in Iran. Both offer the best of limited dependent support
                            facilities available on the Red Sea-Persian Gulf littoral and are
                            optimally situated for operations in the area of our principal regional
                            interests. A request to investigate potential sites for homeporting
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy ships in Iran may be more
                            favorably received by the Shah if presented in a manner that emphasizes
                            Iranian interests involved in the continuation of a <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> presence in the Arabian Sea/Indian
                            Ocean area. The recent message from our Ambassador in Tehran (DTG
                            031505Z Dec 73, cite #8507) reports the Shah’s aversion to any <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy presence which could be perceived
                            as establishment of a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Naval base at
                            Bandar Abbas. This concern notwithstanding, our national interests in
                            maintaining our area presence indicate that every effort be made to
                            persuade the Shah that modification of this position would clearly be in
                            Iran’s best interests. There are encouraging indications that this
                            possibility is not remote based on the Shah’s historical support for a
                            substantial <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Indian <pb facs="0232"

                            during the Arab/Israeli conflict and his continuing support of the
                            HANCOCK Task Group operations. By the same token, Haile Selassie is
                            distinctly pro-western and should be agreeable to the concept of
                            homeporting <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy ships in Ethiopia.
                            This appraisal recognizes that he would have to contend with opposition
                            from the African and Arab states and that some quid-pro-quo might be
                            expected in return, such as increased military assistance.</p>
                        <p>Our initial action should be to query the ambassadors regarding the
                            feasibility of gaining approval to conduct detailed low visibility
                            surveys of potential homeporting locations. This would include as a
                            minimum Bandar Abbas, Chah Bahar and Kharg Island in Iran and Assab and
                            Massawa in Ethiopia. These surveys are necessary before any
                            determination can be made of best location for additional homeporting
                            facilities and the commensurate associated costs.</p>
                        <p>To this end I am attaching a proposed letter to the Secretary of State
                            requesting his support for such action. If you concur with this course
                            of action designed to facilitate continuation of a <gloss

                        </p>
                        <p>The ruling Al-Thani family has been pre-eminent in Qatar since the late
                            19th century. Their predominance has never appeared to be <pb
                                facs="0233" n="198" xml:id="pg_198"/> stronger than under the
                            present Ruler, Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al-Thani, who took power from
                            his cousin Ahmed in February 1972 in a bloodless palace coup. Khalifa, a
                            forceful and energetic man, runs a highly centralized, moderately
                            efficient government, in which the only restraints on his power are
                            traditional tribal and religious customs and his own moderation and
                            common sense.</p>
                        <p>Government policies both domestic and foreign largely reflect Khalifa’s
                            views. Domestically, Qatar is a benevolent dictatorship or
                            quasi-absolute monarchy run along traditional conservative tribal and
                            religious lines. In foreign affairs many Qatari attitudes are similar to
                            those usually attributed to King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> and the Saudi government: deep-seated distrust of
                            Communism leading to a generally tolerant attitude toward the West, in
                            the case of Qatar oriented particularly toward Great Britain; in oil
                            matters a tendency toward conservation of natural resources combined
                            with flexibility about supplying the United States, Western Europe, and
                            Japan; in Gulf matters Khalifa has always taken publicly a line of
                            cooperative relations with other Gulf States; in private he can be
                            rather scathing about most of his Gulf colleagues.</p>
                        <p>Future relations with the United States will probably range from
                            guardedly warm if we maintain a balanced posture in the Arab-Israeli
                            conflict or are instrumental in de-fusing it, to tolerantly chilly if we
                            appear to be favoring Israel.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Policies of the Government—Domestic</p>
                        <p>Qatar has had modest oil revenues for two decades, and substantial
                            revenues for one. Sheikh Ahmed, who was ruler for the decade before
                            Khalifa took power in 1972 distributed much of the State’s income to the
                            various Sheikhs of the Al-Thani family in accordance with a traditional
                            formula, which reportedly allocated at least half the national income to
                            the ruling family. Although the energetic and cautiously progressive
                            present Ruler Khalifa was his Prime Minister, economic development was
                            rather half-hazard and sporadic until the end of the 1960’s. Khalifa’s
                            policy, both as Prime Minister under Ahmed and as Ruler, has been to cut
                            back on hand-outs to the Ruling family, to put substantial sums into
                            carefully chosen economic development projects, and to put aside a tidy
                            proportion of national income each year in conservatively managed
                            European bank portfolios. The funds expended on development have been
                            large enough to have trickled down pretty effectively, and the result is
                            a quietly booming economy, and a slowly but surely modernizing
                            capital.</p>
                        <p>Political institutions and social conventions, however, have not kept
                            pace even with a moderate economic explosion. The Advisory <pb
                                facs="0234" n="199" xml:id="pg_199"/> Council to the Ruler, a group
                            of non-Al-Thani Sheikhs and leading merchants, appointed by the Ruler,
                            which is the nearest approach here to an embryo legistature, thus far
                            has the power only attend official functions and occasionally to form
                            the audience for a semi-public speech by Khalifa. There is no local
                            regularly published press. Radio and television broadcasts are edited to
                            the point of being, with respect to local events, little more than a
                            chronicle of the daily comings and goings of the Ruler and leading
                            Ministers without substantive content or comment. Public security is
                            maintained by a large and constantly visible police force, which
                            maintains an apparently largely benevolent but very tight lid on crime
                            and all other forms of public exuberance.</p>
                        <p>The traditional desert abbah is still de rigeur for Qatari men. Qatari
                            women are rarely seen on the street; if so they wear leather face masks
                            under heavy black veils, an arrangement that seems to favor the ugly
                            unduly. Men do the family shopping. The opening of a modern new hotel
                            here in February 1973 touched off a struggle regarding the serving of
                            liquor, which is normally prohibited, and mixed public bathing, which is
                            still unresolved. These conservative Wahabbi customs, however, are
                            softened by a remarkable degree of tolerance toward the dress and
                            behavior of non-Qataris. In private, drinking by men, and pant-suits for
                            women are becoming increasingly fashionable among the Qatari
                            avant-guard.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Policies</p>
                        <p>The linch-pin of Khalifa’s foreign policy is close brotherly friendship
                            with his much larger and richer next-door neighbor Saudi Arabia. It is
                            evident that he has deep and genuine admiration for King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> as a man and model Monarch.
                            In the past relations have been so close that as much as 20% of the
                            Qatari army and security forces was made up of Saudi troops. This
                            arrangement ended in early 1973 when the Saudi contingent went on strike
                            for higher pay. It was returned forthwith to Saudi Arabia. This
                            incident, however, had no visible cooling effect Saudi-Qatari relations.
                            This strong friendship with its largest neighbor allows Qatar to feel
                            secure with token armed forces; an army of perhaps 3,000, a handful of
                            obsolete tanks, 4 hawker hunters, and a patrol boat or two.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps more than any other Gulf Ruler Khalifa tends to follow
                            Saudi-Arabia’s lead in attitudes and dealings with the outside world.
                            This starts with a deep distrust and fear of Communism in all its
                            manifestations. Despite recurrent rumors, there are to date no Communist
                            Block representatives here, no communist-manufactured products, and no
                            technical assistance. Partly as the other side of the anti-communist
                            coin, and partly as a result of years of close collaboration with the
                            West, particularly Great Britain, Qatar has a strong bias toward the <pb
                                facs="0235" n="200" xml:id="pg_200"/> West. The influence of the
                            British Ambassador, who was formerly British Political Agent here, still
                            probably rivals that of all but two or three of the Ruler’s most
                            intimate advisors. Fortunately the Ambassador is a very moderate and
                            sensible man; unfortunately for the United States, he uses his influence
                            very skillfully to promote British commercial, financial, and industrial
                            interests, thus far largely to the exclusion others particularly in the
                            development and financial fields.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the United States, the government is basically well
                            disposed, but seems to regard us with some reservation, much as one
                            would a large animal who seems friendly, but who could cause a lot of
                            damage. At the same time of the Arab-Israeli war last fall the attitudes
                            of many Qataris stiffened perceptibly toward us, either by instinct, or
                            because we made several announcements concerning aid to Israel. The
                            Ruler was reliably reported to have been upset by what he regarded as
                            our favoring of Israel, but more in wonderment that we would risk the
                            displeasure of the entire Arab world for the sake of Israel than in
                            anger. He and senior Qatari officials maintained an attitude of correct
                            politeness toward the Embassy during this difficult period.</p>
                        <p>Qatar, both geographically, and in its interests is somewhat removed from
                            the Arab-Israeli arena. Nevertheless the emotional ties of Arab
                            brotherhood are very real here, possibly because of the country’s
                            smallness and isolation. Qatar is believed to have contributed very
                            substantial sums to the combattants in the war. During the war the Ruler
                            called an extraordinary session of the Advisory Council before which he
                            delivered a tub-thumping and emotional speech.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the other gulf states Khalifa has always maintained a
                            posture of cooperation and the desire for close fraternal ties. At the
                            time the United Arab Emirates was established, he let it be known that
                            he favored joining the union provided Bahrain did likewise. (He was
                            Deputy-Ruler and Prime Minister at that time) However there is generally
                            thought to be a degree of rivalry between Khalifa and Sheikh Issa of
                            Bahrain. Qatar’s relations with Dubai remain strained because former
                            ruler Ahmad continues to live there under the protection of Sheikh
                            Rashid. This strain extends to a degree to relations with Sheikh Zayyid
                            of Abu-Dhabi, though to a lesser extent. In private Khalifa does not
                            have many kind words to say about any of his fellow-rulers in the Gulf,
                            although in fairness to him, one of his major complaints is that they
                            are too narrowly oriented, and fail to think in Gulf-wide terms.</p>

                        <p>Despite the fact that about one half its population is a polyglot mixture
                            which comes and goes constantly, there appears to be a remarkable lack
                            of ferment in Qatar. Qataris seem to be by nature conservative and
                            tradition-oriented. Most outsiders here are laborers and artisans <pb

                            Pakistan, many of them desperately poor, and disinterested in anything

                            home and perhaps to build a small nest egg before returning
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>The security forces seem able to keep an effective watch on the few
                            thousand outside Arabs including Palestinians, who live here more or
                            less permanently. There appears to be no effective organization or
                            leadership from this group in the direction of extremism or any movement
                            of potential danger to the regime. The first generation of Qataris to
                            have formal schooling is still in its teens. At least until this
                            generation is able to make its weight felt, it seems a good guess that
                            the Al-Thani dynasty will be able to maintain its present highly
                            conservative and traditional form of rule.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Relations With the United States</p>
                        <p>Sheikh Khalifa and his top advisors do not seem to have the admiration
                            for things American that one often finds in newly developing countries.
                            Qatar has had a long and close relationship with Western Europe,
                            particularly Great Britain, and seems to find European products,
                            technical help, and advice satisfactory, comfortable, and safe. Qatar,
                            of course, has enough oil wealth for perhaps another generation, so that
                            it can afford to buy advice and help where it chooses without
                            consideration of who will pay the bill.</p>
                        <p>In attitudes toward the United States, one feels a slight sense of
                            reservation among high Qatari officials. This may be compounded of
                            unfamiliarity, a vague uneasiness about our size and strength, and some
                            doubts about our position in the Arab-Israeli conflict. These
                            reservations do not seem to apply as much in the business community,
                            which is more narrowly concerned with what will sell at a profit,
                            although banking is still largely in British and Arab hands.</p>
                        <p>Despite these slight and vague reservations, Qataris are basically well
                            disposed toward the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, and will
                            probably become more so with increased contact, particularly if we can
                            become instrumental in obtaining an Arab-Israeli settlement or
                            semi-permanent cease fire. Although they are geographically and in
                            national interest rather remote from the front lines, emotional ties
                            with brother Arabs are genuine, and Qataris will be watching to see
                            whether we maintain what they consider to be a balanced policy on the
                            Arab-Israeli question.</p>

                        <p>491. Subject: Middle East Force—Meeting with Amir. Ref: Manama 475.</p>
                        <p>1. July 10 I called on Amir to present letter from Speaker Albert
                            congratulating him on establishment National Assembly here.</p>
                        <p>2. Obviously pleased, Amir began to talk about <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Bahrain friendship and how much Bahrain welcomes
                            Americans here, adding “including the Navy”.</p>
                        <p>3. I expressed gratification to hear this. Amir said that he had recently
                            told John Gatch he intended for Navy to remain and wanted me to know
                            this too. I said this news would be greeted with relief in Washington
                            since <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was growing quite concerned
                            about Navy’s status here, particularly since Navy wives and children are
                            uncertain about what plans to make.</p>
                        <p>4. Amir said “you may inform your government the Navy is remaining in
                            Bahrain and so is the Bahrain school”. He added that some Ministers are
                            still undecided but that he was going to make the decision in this case.
                            Amir said this must be settled quickly, thought he would call the
                            Cabinet together July 13, and let us know what formal decision had been
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>5. He then stressed there are two major problems concerning Navy’s
                            continuation here: (1) Bahrain must have legal jurisdiction over
                            offenses by Navy personnel since present arrangement is unacceptable to
                            Bahrain’s concept of sovereignity and Bahraini opinion (he was
                            particularly forceful on this point); (2) Bahrain must be able to show
                            more financial benefits from Navy’s presence. He added that I should
                            know privately that Kuwaitis had offered to give Bahrain “twice” the
                            rent that Navy is paying if Bahrain would not keep Navy here, and that
                            this still rankles. I told Amir I was at call of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> to discuss whatever alterations need
                            to be made to existing arrangements in order for Middle East Force to
                            remain. Amir said he wanted to settle matter quickly, well before return
                            of National Assembly in October.</p>
                        <pb facs="0238" n="203" xml:id="pg_203"/>
                        <p>6. I must caution addressees that Amir was alone without restraining
                            influence of Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, that no formal <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> decision has been made, and that there
                            is serious constitutional question in minds of <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> whether government can take this decision, or rescind
                            termination notice, or adjust terms agreement or lease without at least
                            consulting, and possibly seeking approval of, National Assembly. I must
                            also point out that as of this moment we are under proper formal
                            notification that stationing agreement is to terminate in October and if
                            we are unable to satisfy <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> on
                            jurisdiction it is not beyond realm of possibility that after October we
                            will have Navy here but no agreement at all.</p>

                        <p>519. Subject: Retaining Middle East Force in Bahrain. Ref: Manama
                            0514.</p>
                        <p>1. July 17 I had first opportunity to discuss in greater detail with
                            Iranian Ambassador his July 16 meeting with Amir on Middle East Force.
                            Amir had appeared uncertain what Iranian position might be and hence
                            seemed especially relieved and appreciative that Shah supporting his own
                            desire to see Navy remain. From Amir’s remarks it clear to Iranian that
                            Saudi message of support is getting through.</p>
                        <p>2. According to Iranian, Amir specifically mentioned Foreign Minister
                            Sheikh Muhammad Bin Mubarak as among those <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> Ministers still opposing Navy’s continued presence,
                            and, as reported <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, Amir said
                            he tired of Cabinet’s debating this issue and ready to make decision
                            himself. (Comment: Constitutional government is new here, and Amir <pb
                                facs="0239" n="204" xml:id="pg_204"/> sometimes displays nostalgia
                            for a simpler, less vexing way of making decisions. I would guess odds
                            his actually ordering Cabinet to decide to let Navy stay are only
                            fifty/fifty.)</p>
                        <p>3. With Iranian (protect), Amir made much of fact that Kuwait continuing
                            to urge <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> to stick by October 73
                            decision to terminate agreement. According Iranian, Amir said Kuwaitis
                            now talk of paying Bahrain “five times” what <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Navy would have, as compensation for Navy’s going.
                            (Comment: Figure seems to grow everytime Amir tells this story). From
                            Amir’s remarks Iranian got impression that while Amir and Prime Minister
                            unimpressed and irritated by this Kuwaiti advice, other Ministers,
                            notably Foreign Minister, might be taking note of it. (Amir said he
                            would be sending Prime Minister to Kuwait in near future to discuss
                            broad range of Kuwaiti/Bahraini relations, about which he less than
                            happy at moment.)</p>
                        <p>4. I would be very surprised if anyone, including <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, could get <gloss target="#t_GOK_1"
                                >GOK</gloss> to support actively Bahraini decision to permit Mid
                            East Force to remain here. Wonder, however, if we should not consider
                            pros and cons of approaching <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> on
                            this subject, with maximum expectation of inducing them to stay out of

                            such approach and that it might therefore rebound to our benefit in
                            overall relations with Kuwait. Whether on other hand it might intensify
                            rather than muffle Kuwaiti interference in Middle East Force issue is
                            question addressees in far better position to judge than I.</p>

                        <p>4228. Subj: <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Presence in Bahrain.
                            Ref: Jidda 4072; Jidda 3967.</p>
                        <p>1. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>, Saudi Minister
                            of Interior, asked me privately yesterday (July 20) during the <persName
                                corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> visit whether I had told you of
                            his success in Bahrain. I said I had reported it immediately (reftels).
                            He was very pleased.</p>
                        <p>2. He said the Kuwaiti attempts to bribe the Bahrainis not to annul the
                            base cancellation order were not even in Kuwait’s own interest; Saudi
                            Arabia was disturbed and could not understand why Kuwait took this
                            position.</p>
                        <p>3. He said Saudi Arabia would give financial assistance to Bahrain, but
                            it was important, per se, for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            to pay more for its base rights than it is paying today. The Bahrainis
                            could then see tangible, positive evidence of the American presence on
                            the island.</p>
                        <p>4. I don’t know whether <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s
                            claim of being solely responsible for this positive development is
                            correct. The Bahraini Emir’s backbone does seem to have firmed recently,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> probably does bear
                            some responsibility for it. But even if this is just another <hi
                                rend="italic">post hoc ergo propter hoc,</hi> could you send
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> a short note of thanks
                            on the line of “without whose help this wonderful achievement would not
                            have been possible” as soon as the Emir delivers his promised

                        <p>1. Foreign Minister, when I called on him today, informed me “officially”
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> has determined it will rescind

                            may continue to remain stationed in Bahrain. He emphasized this had been
                            difficult decision in which all Cabinet took part and was taken not
                            within narrow context of stationing agreement and <gloss

                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> stressed this must remain
                            “confidential” understanding until certain problems worked out: 1)
                            Modalities—exchange of confidential notes in which we acknowledge
                            termination notice and express interest in <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> reconsideration in view changed circumstances in Middle

                            certain related problems, 2) “legal questions”—“most important” issue of
                            legal jurisdiction plus <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> desire to
                            see termination provision of agreement shortened from one year to six
                            months, 3) “economic questions”—benefits, focused largely on technical
                            assistance, as evidence stronger future <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Bahrain relationship in which decision to permit Navy

                            ostensibly tied to Navy presence. Also question of MIDEASTFORCE use of

                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> emphasized again and again
                            that at present stage <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> decision must
                            be handled in closest confidentiality. He said “legal <pb facs="0242"
                                n="207" xml:id="pg_207"/> questions” must be worked out first, with
                            great urgency, and then we must sort out “economic questions”. He is
                            looking toward having this business all tied up by end of August,
                            leaving September for <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> effort to
                            lobby to convince own people and neighboring states that its decision is

                        <p>5. Comment: From <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>’s remarks in
                            hour long discussion it most obvious President’s and Secretary’s recent
                            efforts toward Middle East peace have been decisive factor in turning
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> around. Although Foreign
                            Minister careful not to acknowledge it to me, there is no doubt that
                            approaches by Iran and Saudi Arabia have also played most helpful role
                            in moving <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> to this difficult
                            decision. In view of extreme <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>
                            sensitivity about keeping decision confidential at this stage must

                        <p>1. In Abu Dhabi Embtel 1252 of September 15 Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SME_1">Sterner</persName> reported a conversation in
                            London with <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Shaykh Zayid</persName> of
                            Abu Dhabi, <pb facs="0243" n="208" xml:id="pg_208"/> President of the
                            United Arab Emirates (<gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>), in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Shaykh Zayid</persName> discussed his
                            desire to strengthen the central government of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> and criticized three of his fellow
                            Shaykhly rulers for dragging their feet and resisting centralization.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SME_1">Sterner</persName> seemed to
                            have accepted the remarks of <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Shaykh
                                Zayid</persName> at face value and indicated that he planned to do
                            some missionary work with those other Shaykhs to persuade them to
                            cooperate for a stronger federation.</p>
                        <p>2. Some of my resident and near-resident Arabists who have spent many
                            years in and around the Gulf believe Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SME_1">Sterner</persName> should be cautioned as to the
                            dangers of trying to broker a stronger <gloss target="#t_UAE_1"
                                >UAE</gloss> with the other Shaykhs on behalf of <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Shaykh Zayid</persName>. As so often happens in
                            the Middle East, the reaction is likely to be stronger than the action,
                            and quite negative in several respects.</p>
                        <p>3. The use is very much <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName>’s
                            show and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SME_1">Sterner</persName>’s
                            cable, whether he realizes it or not, makes that point loud and clear.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> complains about each
                            state having its own army and intel service, but his own state has the
                            largest of both. If he feels so strongly about this, why does he not
                            lead the way by combining his army (12,000) with the Union Defense Force
                            (2,600)? This gesture might get a positive response from the other
                            states. As long as he keeps his own force and intel service, how can he
                            expect the others to do less? The fact is he wishes to bring them all
                            under his control.</p>
                        <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">4½ lines not declassified</hi>] Unlike Abu Dhabi,
                            Rashid has very few foreign advisors—Dubai is run by native
                            Dubayyans.</p>
                        <p>5. If Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SME_1">Sterner</persName> starts
                            to talk “union” with Rashid, or with Sultan of Sharjah, or Saqar of
                            Ras-al-Khaymah, he is likely to get caught in the middle of a nasty
                            game, with the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> the ultimate loser.
                            His moves will not be lost on Iran, which has its own ideas about the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> and has close relations with
                            Dubai and Sharjah. I am not stating that a strong <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> is not in <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> interest, it most certainly is. There are, however,
                            more and safer options open to US than those proposed in Abu Dhabi
                            Embtel. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SME_1">Sterner</persName>’s
                            proposals concern only our relationship with <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> and do not take into account
                            the broader area realities.</p>
                        <p>6. While we are all pleased by the Saudi-<gloss target="#t_UAE_1"
                                >UAE</gloss> (Abu Dhabi) border agreement, let us not forget that
                            the agreement has not yet been implemented and there are still points to
                            be ironed out on the ground. Also, let us wait until the first Saudi
                            Ambassador arrives in the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> before we
                            conclude everything is smooth sailing. The question is, do we want to
                            associate ourselves with <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"
                            >Zayid</persName>’s <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>, or with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> as a viable entity prepared to
                            play a role with its neighbors in insuring the security of the Gulf?
                            Right now <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName>’s views are
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>’s views. His views [on] Iran,
                            and on Arabizing the Gulf, are hardly compatible with <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy. We should work on <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> as well as the other Shaykhs,
                            not on the other Shaykhs for <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"

                            Development (Acting Foreign) Minister Shirawi, resulting in most
                            illuminating exposition to date on what <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> wants from us in way of broader relationship, focused

                                >septel</gloss>). Then proceeded to standard 20–30 minute “courtesy
                            call” on Amir and Prime Minister. The Khalifa leaders were lying in
                            wait. Fifty minutes later, <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName>
                            emerged from significant exchange in which “Amir-Prime Minister show”
                            had been most intense, emphatic and open in my experience, in telling
                            how they view US-Bahraini relationship and how this relationship bears
                            on future of the region and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role in
                            it. As usual, the Amir, who tends toward one-liners, provided the
                            gracious broad brush touch while the Prime Minister moved in for the
                            heavier and more specific articulation, with Shirawi adding the
                            occasional nuance. Essentially they spoke in harmony, as follows:</p>
                        <p>3. Middle East peace and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role.
                            Bahrainis expressed deep gratification and relief in response to Mr.

                            world convinced peace must be achieved in Middle East.</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s visit.
                            Amir, in emphasizing appreciation for role Secretary has played in
                            Middle East peace effort, noted Bahrain disappointment, but
                            understanding, that Secretary had been unable to pay brief visit to
                            Bahrain last spring. He expressed hope Secretary’s schedule in near
                            future would permit a visit to Bahrain and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> promised to convey personally to
                            Secretary the Amir’s standing invitation.</p>
                        <p>5. Soviet role in area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName>
                            discussed briefly his recent visit to <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> noting apparent desire <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> leadership to move away from reliance on Soviet
                            assistance and to strengthen ties with US. Bahrainis expressed great
                            pleasure in this trend (Amir twice noted his admiration for al-Ayni). In
                            response to Bahraini question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1"
                                >Sober</persName> sketched Soviet role in recent Middle East
                            developments noting that while there is no evidence Soviets seek to
                            disrupt peace efforts, we can assume Soviets view their diminishing
                            influence in Egypt particularly and in Middle East diplomatic
                            initiatives generally with some disappointment. Amir said “We want them
                            to be disappointed.” Bahrainis noted need for continued vigilance re
                            Soviet intentions in Gulf area, particularly Soviet efforts working
                            through <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> and Iraq to undermine
                            regional stability.</p>
                        <p>6. Gulf stability and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role.
                            Evidencing interest in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1"
                            >Sober</persName>’s impressions of visit to Saudi Arabia, Bahrainis came
                            down hard on key role of Saudis in Gulf. Prime Minister described Saudi
                            Arabia as “backbone of stability of Arab side of Gulf” and King
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> as “father” to
                            smaller Arab states in region. Added that “all” of smaller states
                            recognize importance of Saudi role, “even Kuwait though they don’t like
                            to admit it.” Bahrainis also noted full awareness of importance Iranian
                            role in security and stability in Gulf. They went on to emphasize
                            importance of close relationship between US and Saudi Arabia and of
                            increasing US efforts to support orderly Saudi development, welcoming
                            this trend enthusiastically. Prime Minister expounded at some length on
                            fact that King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> had
                            stuck with US at lowest moments of American prestige in Arab world,
                            expressing pleasure that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            appreciative of Saudi’s good faith and friendship. Bahrainis noted they
                            also had constantly maintained faith in US. They stressed importance US
                            contribution to stability of Gulf region, describing US support to Saudi
                            Arabia and Iran as major and welcome element in fostering the security
                            of all the Gulf, but urging that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            also intensify direct relations with smaller Gulf states, notably
                            Bahrain.</p>
                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy presence. In response to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName>’s expression of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government appreciation for Bahraini
                            leadership’s favorable attitude toward our desire to retain Middle East
                            Force in Bahrain, Bahrainis <pb facs="0246" n="211" xml:id="pg_211"/>
                            stressed their pleasure that Navy would remain. They noted this reflects
                            long-standing goodwill toward <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, and
                            as evidence Bahraini leadership takes pride in its friendship with
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government and desires even
                            closer relationship. Prime Minister said there are certain “details” to
                            be worked out in arranging continued Middle East Force presence but that
                            these should pose no problem in context overall good relations.
                            Bahrainis added, however, that continued presence <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy inevitably subjects Bahraini
                            leadership to questions by Bahraini public and friendly Arab states and
                            attacks by less friendly ones since fact that Middle East Force
                            stationed in Bahrain implies <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> has a
                            relationship with <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> which no other
                            Arab country has.</p>
                        <p>8. “Special” US-Bahraini relationship. Prime Minister added that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> has “guts” enough to stand up to
                            criticism of Middle East Force presence in Bahrain but needs evidence of
                            US support to combat such criticism. <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> must be able to show its own people and friendly
                            neighbors that in having special relationship with US, manifest in part
                            by Middle East Force presence, it has some additional significant
                            manifestation of US cooperation. This cooperation should focus on
                            development of civilian economy. Long-standing cooperation between US
                            private business and Bahrain is most welcome and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> would be grateful for <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> efforts to encourage, as a matter of
                            policy, increased presence of American private business in Bahrain. Of
                            particular and urgent importance, however, is need for some tangible
                            evidence of official US economic cooperation and support. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> has come to conclusion that <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> technical assistance, through
                            providing a number of expert American advisers on concessional terms,
                            would be most effective way <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could
                            assist Bahrain in handling political problems of continued <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy presence, while serving at same
                            time mutual US-Bahraini interest in strengthening social-economic fabric
                            in Bahrain, and hence in Gulf generally. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1"
                                >Sober</persName> explained in some detail strong <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> interest in providing technology and
                            expert advice to Bahrain and other states in region, noting present
                            statutory and budgetary restraints on providing such help on other than
                            strictly reimbursable basis. He assured Amir and Prime Minister <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> continuing to look at this problem
                            urgently and would lose no opportunity to be of help where possible.
                            Bahrainis indicated awareness and appreciation of <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> good faith in this regard but stressed
                            urgency of their need for significant token of <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> support for Bahrain development, reiterating their
                            conviction that Bahrain already and inevitably has a “special”
                            relationship with US, and wishes to see it grow.</p>
                        <p>9. Comment. I consider Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName>’s
                            visit especially beneficial in indicating to Bahraini leadership <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interest in Bahrain and Gulf region
                            generally and in providing reassurances re <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> policy in Middle East and Gulf. Both Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> and I were struck by intensity
                            and <pb facs="0247" n="212" xml:id="pg_212"/> openness with which the
                            Amir and Prime Minister expressed their desire for stability throughout
                            Gulf area with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> effectively
                            supporting Saudi and Iranian roles while intensifying direct
                            relationships with smaller Gulf states. Bahraini perception of Gulf and
                            our role in it is consistent with our own policy objectives. Amir and
                            Prime Minister are obviously sincere in their desire to see <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy presence continue in Gulf,
                            accommodated in Bahrain. At same time they are understandably sensitive
                            to being exposed, both at home and in rest of Arab world, to criticism
                            for maintaining only <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military
                            establishment on Arab soil. Hence they feel strong and urgent need for
                            evidence of “special” relationship with <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> in which visibility of Middle East Force presence will
                            be offset by some <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> support for
                            orderly development of Bahrain’s economy. Various indications of growing
                            US-Bahraini cooperation are welcome, including continued <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> encouragement to American business
                            community to consider opportunities in Bahrain. Essentially, however,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> has concluded that presence of
                            small number <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> civilian expert
                            advisers in Bahrain, provided by <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            under concessional arrangements, would best evidence evolving
                            US-Bahraini relationship in which continued Navy presence might be more
                            easily justified to public opinion. <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>
                            leadership also sees <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> technical
                            advisory help as desirable for its own sake, serving mutual <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Bahraini interest in orderly progress
                            in Bahrain and Gulf region generally. One cannot escape conclusion that
                            Bahraini request is urgent and based on sound reading not only of
                            Bahraini interest but of our own interest, both political and
                            commercial.</p>

                            recent US statements about possible intervention in area and other
                            related US actions. Believe it would be inadvisable to press issue

                            summary.</p>
                        <p>2. After repeated requests to Foreign Ministry for reply to our note
                            requesting clearance for visit of <hi rend="italic">USS La Salle</hi>
                            Feb 24–26, we were advised to take matter up directly with Shaykh Hamad
                            bin Khalifa al Thani, Commander-in-Chief of Qatari Armed Forces, who is
                            also Amir’s oldest son. On evening Jan 27 I called on Shaykh Hamad and
                            asked about our clearance request for <hi rend="italic">La
                            Salle.</hi></p>
                        <p>3. Shaykh Hamad reminded me of our previous conversation during which he
                            had raised question about advisability of <hi rend="italic">La
                                Salle</hi> visit in present atmosphere (Doha 59). He said, as he had
                            promised, he had discussed situation with the Amir who had confirmed
                            Hamad’s judgment that visit inadvisable at this time. Hamad asserted
                            that against background of Secretary’s statement in <hi rend="italic"
                                >Business Week</hi> interview about possible intervention in this
                            area, which statement subsequently had been repeated and confirmed a
                            number of times not only by Secretary but by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and Secretary of Defense, US
                            naval ship visit here would put <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> in
                            awkward position vis-à-vis domestic and Arab public opinion. Hamad
                            indicated that current public furor over US request for facilities on
                            Masirah Island and canard re alleged US formation of three divisions for
                            service in Mid East, plus recent <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>
                                Minis<pb facs="0249" n="214" xml:id="pg_214"/>terial Conference in
                            Algiers and further <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> Ministerial
                            and Summit meetings planned for late February/early March, were bound to
                            keep pot boiling on alleged US intervention threats in area. It was in
                            this atmosphere that <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> would have to
                            answer to Qatari people and other Arabs for its permission for US naval
                            visit, and this had brought <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> to
                            decision that <hi rend="italic">La Salle</hi> visit inadvisable.</p>
                        <p>3. Hamad said that he, the Amir and other <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1"
                                >GOQ</gloss> officials appreciated US explanations re recent
                            statements and actions, but first impressions were lasting ones and
                            unfavorable to US, particularly in public forum. Hamad stated that he
                            could not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not rule out
                            subversive-inspired hostile demonstrations in Doha if <hi rend="italic"
                                >La Salle</hi> visited, and he believed this could harm US/<gloss
                                target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> relations. He believed that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>’s frank and friendly counsel for <hi
                                rend="italic">La Salle</hi> to stay away at this time would be best
                            for all concerned.</p>
                        <p>4. I expressed disappointment with <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>
                            attitude which indicated that anti-US propaganda in area instigated by
                            enemies of <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> as well as US, had done
                            its job well. Hamad replied that US statements had given anti-US forces
                            their opportunity. I answered that <hi rend="italic">La Salle</hi> visit
                            would demonstrate, despite hostile propaganda, <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1"
                                >GOQ</gloss>’s understanding of real meaning and intention of US
                            presence in area as force for stability. Hamad responded that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> could not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1"
                                >rpt</gloss> not ignore external and publicly understood
                            implications of recent US statements, its perception of ex post facto
                            explanations notwithstanding. He said his frankness with me indicative
                            of solid basis of US/<gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> relations
                            since only friends could be so candid. <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1"
                                >GOQ</gloss> decision dictated by its own political environment and
                            not intended to mar its excellent relations with US. He said decision
                            should not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not become issue between
                            us and since matter not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not in
                            public domain it need never surface as problem or embarrassment between
                            two countries. He asked for our understanding of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>’s situation.</p>
                        <p>5. I said that I did understand <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>’s
                            situation but did not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not agree
                            that it leads to decided course of action. I found it ironic that
                            Iraqis, who <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> feared were actively
                            engaged in subversion here, had had naval visit late last year. Hamad
                            replied that <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> could not refuse Iraq
                            since it fellow Arab country and its ships had visited all other Gulf
                            states. He said <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> had made its
                            attitude toward Iraq clear during visit by fact that neither he nor any
                            other senior Qatari official had attended any of functions associated
                            with Iraqi naval visit, and this was public indication of Qatari
                            disfavor toward present <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>. I noted
                            that US ships too called frequently at other Gulf ports and indeed were
                            provided facilities in Bahrain. Hamad countered that he was not <gloss
                                target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not aware of any US naval visits since
                            Secretary’s and subsequent <pb facs="0250" n="215" xml:id="pg_215"/>
                            statements from other <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> officials on
                            possible intervention in area. I also expressed great skepticism about
                            danger of demonstrations against <hi rend="italic">La Salle</hi> in
                            Doha, saying it had been my impression that security situation here
                            completely under control. Hamad said that nuisance potential of a few
                            subversives should not be underestimated. In any case, the major concern
                            of <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> was to preempt cause of possible
                            demonstrations by advising against <hi rend="italic">La Salle</hi>
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>6. Hamad reiterated that he did not wish this matter to become issue
                            between our governments. I suggested that matter be reviewed again with
                            Amir. He said that he could do this or I could do it myself, but he
                            strongly advised against this course of action. He said Amir’s
                            displeasure with US statements had been clearly conveyed during Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_PC_1">Percy</persName>’s visit (Doha 46), and
                            that other Arab moderates such as <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> and Saudis had also spoken out strongly on issue.
                            According Hamad, although moderate Arab views principal bench mark for
                            Qataris, they could not ignore ravings of radicals such as Algerians,
                            Libyans and Iraqis, and expose themselves to general Arab criticism by
                            permitting US ship visit in this highly charged atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>7. I repeated to Hamad my disappointment over <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1"
                                >GOQ</gloss> attitude but said that I would reluctantly accept his
                            advice not to press issue further. I told him I would of course be
                            reporting <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>’s decision and his
                            remarks in detail to my government. He replied that this is exactly what
                            he wished since the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should have a
                            very clear picture of the impact of its recent statements and actions on
                            its friends in this area.</p>
                        <p>8. Comment: <hi rend="italic">La Salle’s</hi> non-visit is clearly
                            casualty of Secretary’s <hi rend="italic">Business Week</hi> interview
                            and subsequent statements and actions interpreted as confirming US
                            intervention intentions in this area. I believe Qataris sincerely wish
                            to believe our explanations but we have not been able to dispel their
                            doubts and suspicions of our true intentions, and progression of events
                            in past few weeks has done nothing to allay these suspicions. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> is wondering and apprehensive about
                            what our next surprise will be in this region. I am too.</p>
                        <p>9. Comment continued: On immediate problem of ship visit, as indicated
                            above, I do not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not believe it
                            advisable to press further. <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>
                            typically wants to keep its head down. Although I have considered going
                            over Hamad’s head to the Amir, I think this would be a vain and
                            counter-productive attempt to convince him to change his mind. It is
                            un-realistic to expect Qataris to stand up for what we say is true; even
                            though they want to believe it, they don’t. Since it is indicated that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> does not wish to give US a
                            formal refusal, for cosmetic and record purposes, we will send note to
                            Foreign Ministry withdrawing <hi rend="italic">La Salle</hi> clearance
                            request citing “changed operational requirements”. There are a number of
                            officials in Foreign Ministry and armed forces who are aware of our
                            pending request, and our initiative <pb facs="0251" n="216"
                                xml:id="pg_216"/> in withdrawing it will provide a thin but
                            plausible cover for <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>’s turndown.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador al Sabah</hi> began by apologizing for
                            missing the Secretary’s lecture at Georgetown the previous afternoon but
                            noted he was speaking at Johns Hopkins at the same time. <hi

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> stated that he wished to speak
                            candidly as only friends are able to. Specifically, he wished to raise
                            two issues. First, he would appreciate the Secretary’s comments about
                            Masirah Island and, secondly, would like his views concerning possible
                            US interference in the Gulf and, specifically, Kuwait. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName></hi>
                            responded that <pb facs="0252" n="217" xml:id="pg_217"/> with respect to
                            Masirah, there was no news to report. The US contemplated occasional
                            flights into the Indian Ocean area via Diego Garcia, which would
                            occasionally refuel at Masirah, since that is a “transition point”.
                            However, there was no plan to put military power in there and the event
                            has no particular significance in itself. With regard to the second
                            point, the Secretary stated that he assumed the Ambassador was referring
                            to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s interview in
                                <hi rend="italic">Business Week.</hi> In that interview he had
                            stated a number of propositions which could be characterized as
                            “political science,” e.g., the proposition that in case of strangulation
                            or the gravest emergency, recourse to military action would have to be
                            considered. This was not intended to refer to any specific actions.
                            However, it has resulted in some complexities. At his recent press
                            conference, <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss> was asked why the
                            US sells arms to the Gulf states, as those arms might be used against
                            the US in the event of an intervention. He had replied at the time that
                            obviously he did not consider such an eventuality to be likely. Rather,
                            our objective is to strengthen the indigenous military capability and
                            security of nations in the Gulf. That factor should be kept in mind in
                            understanding the context of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s remarks.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> noted that the press, especially in
                            the Gulf, treats intervention as an imminent occurrence. <hi
                                rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> replied that this was “hogwash”.
                                <hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> observed that it would be
                            useful in such cases to have some statement of explanation or
                            clarification, and he intended to make this point with the State
                            Department in the near future. He noted that we are in a position where
                            things are moving smoothly between our two countries, and such
                            statements make things difficult. For example, Kuwait has just had a new
                            election which will bring new faces into the National Assembly. He could
                            not predict the attitudes of the new Assembly exactly, but it is
                            possible that they would take up such issues for political purposes. He
                            gave the example of a recent case where a rigidly Moslem member of the
                            Assembly demanded that liquor be banned at embassies, on airlines, and
                            other places under government control. Although the Ambassador was
                            personally aware that three-fourths of the members of the Assembly do
                            drink; nevertheless they could not oppose this proposition since
                            elections were near. As a result, the Ambassador must personally take
                            the blame if he serves drinks at a reception. Obviously, it is to our
                            advantage to avoid creating misunderstandings which make our relations
                            more difficult. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1"
                                    >SecDef</gloss></hi> replied that for his part, he wished the
                            subject would go away, and he promised to raise the issue with Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. He was amused by
                            the Ambassador’s story and recalled a similar situation when he was in
                            Ireland 20 years ago, during the continuing decay of Irish nationalism,
                            when only 20 percent of the Irish still spoke Gaelic. Nevertheless, when
                            it was proposed to conduct all government business in Gaelic, <pb
                                facs="0253" n="218" xml:id="pg_218"/> no one could come out
                            four-square against it, even though the debate had to be conducted in
                            English.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> noted that Kuwait has no intention
                            of strangling its friends. This had been told to the US Ambassador in
                            Kuwait in the presence of Senator <persName corresp="#p_PC_1"
                                >Percy</persName> during his call on the Crown Prince. The
                            Government of Kuwait wishes to work together with the US to prevent any
                            situation being <hi rend="italic">forced upon them</hi> (repeated for
                            emphasis) as was the case in 1973. He was personally optimistic about
                            the composition of the new Parliament, but recognized that politicians
                            will go their own ways. He was personally acquainted with many of the
                            Deputies and believed they were reasonable and moderate. <hi
                                rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss></hi>
                            reiterated that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s
                            comments were more in the form of an observation rather than a threat.
                            The clear inference of these remarks is that in case of an embargo, the
                            US could not remain passive. This was probably understood even before
                            the statement was made, and whether the advantages of making it explicit
                            outweighed the disadvantages was not certain. The Secretary observed
                            that he was encouraged by the Ambassador’s comments on the new
                            Parliament. He noted that the independence of the Gulf states is a
                            result of the balance of power and is indirectly related to a US
                            presence. If the Soviets became paramount, the degree of freedom
                            available to the Gulf states would diminish. Therefore, the interests of
                            the area can not be disassociated from the utility to them of US power.
                            Our relationship should be one of partnership. Egypt’s experience with
                            the Soviets over 20 years is a good example. The Egyptians appreciate
                            the balance of power and their need to be able to act independently.
                            Without such a balance, a move such as that 1½ years ago to remove the
                            Soviets would not have been possible. In the case of Kuwait, with the
                            proximity of Soviet power to the north, together with the role of Iraq,
                            the importance of these factors should be well recognized.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> noted with respect to the Iraqi
                            situation that he found it sad. He noted, however, that there are those
                            who say that when the US gives arms to Iran this prompts the Soviets to
                            increase their military support of Iraq. <hi rend="italic">The
                                Secretary</hi> interjected that we do not give arms to Iran—we sell
                            them. <hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> agreed that the US has the
                            right to sell to whomever they please. But the continued military
                            build-up in Iran gives the impression that they are “too big for the
                            area”, and Iranian military involvement has extended as far away as
                            Vietnam, where they sent aircraft. Kuwait was particularly concerned
                            with increased Soviet presence in Iraq and Aden. <hi rend="italic"
                                    ><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss></hi> asked his views
                            on Soviet activities in Aden. <hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi>
                            replied that they “hear of this.” The Kuwaitis had invited
                            representatives from South Yemen to visit and see Kuwaiti democracy for
                            themselves. They were shocked to find that it did not resemble their

                            as a “pawn of the West”. Kuwait had also tried to give them economic
                            help and thus relieve some of the pressures which push them toward the
                            Soviets. He noted that in Yemeni schools they ask a child to say “God
                            give me food” and nothing happens. They then ask him to say “Mao give me
                            food” and they give him food. This is very impressive to a 7-year old.
                            Therefore, Kuwait has concentrated on food, schools, and hospitals. At
                            least one result of this policy is that they no longer talk about
                            “liberating” the Gulf. That doesn’t include Oman, of course. <hi
                                rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> noted that the Sultan during his
                            recent visit had not been pleased to be singled out that way.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> stated that it was Kuwait’s
                            objective to try to moderate extremists, but to do so they need help
                            from their friends, and not threatening words. “The danger is much
                            greater than we are”. The Soviets have asked once or twice to stop in
                            Kuwait, but were always politely refused. “Many mistakes have been made
                            in Palestine. We should try to avoid mistakes in the Gulf.” He referred
                            to an occasion at Johns Hopkins the day before when he had followed an
                            Arab speaker who repeatedly referred to the Persian Gulf. He had pointed
                            out the controversy over the name, and had suggested calling it just
                            “the Gulf” as a compromise. The other speaker referred to a map behind
                            him, only to discover the map said “Arabian Gulf”. <hi rend="italic">The
                                Secretary</hi> joked that there is also a tendency to confuse the
                            “Gulf of Florida” with the “Gulf of Mexico”.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> said that he was not concerned with
                            names, but with security. Kuwait respects the Shah and has no reason to
                            doubt his intentions. But if these arms should get into the wrong hands
                            and operate from territory such as the islands off Ras al Khaima, “the
                            Gulf would become a lake and it is the Arabs who would be strangled.”

                            stated that we view the Soviet forces north of Iran and Turkey in terms
                            of possible expansionism into the gulf area where there was little power
                            to oppose them. Strengthening Iran creates something more formidable for
                            the Soviets to see when they look south. From the viewpoint of others,
                            this gives the impression of regional imbalance. This has been a source
                            of concern, a source of thought for us. If the Iranians do not obtain
                            arms from us, they can easily turn to European suppliers or even to the
                            Soviets. In view of the money allocated for arms purchases in Iran,
                            nothing will stop the Iranian build-up—irrespective of US policy. We
                            would hope that Iran would focus its military attention toward the north
                            and that US supply would serve as a moderating influence should the need
                            arise. As the Ambassador had noted, the concern is not with Iran, but
                            with power falling into the wrong hands. In such a case, US influence
                            would be highly desirable. <hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> asked
                            whether such US influence in the event of a change of regime in Iran
                            would not require a substantial presence on Masirah. <pb facs="0255"
                                n="220" xml:id="pg_220"/>
                            <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss></hi>
                            replied we have no present intention of having a substantial presence in
                            Masirah, though certainly a major political change in Iran would bear
                            consideration. He noted again that we have no desire to build up forces
                            in the area, and if the Soviets keep their hands off we see no threat to
                            the region. However, if the Soviets do look south again, we want to be
                            able to match them.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> reiterated that it is essential to
                            avoid misunderstandings so the Gulf states can continue to resist Soviet
                            requests. Statements, not only by government leaders but also by
                            Congressmen, get a great deal of attention in Kuwait. <hi rend="italic"
                                    ><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss></hi> noted that he
                            believed we have made a number of statements concerning stability and
                            the need for a peaceful settlement in the Arab-Israel dispute which we
                            hope would have a settling effect in the region as a whole. We must
                            remember that the Soviets have 4 million men and 160 divisions under
                            arms, representing massive military power. Although we appreciate the
                            desirability of resisting Soviet requests in the Gulf, that does not
                            address Soviet power adequately.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> joined
                            the group. <hi rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> noted that many nations
                            have only the Soviets to rely on. President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> stuck his neck out in resisting such reliance. He
                            hoped the US would help. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1"
                                    >SecDef</gloss></hi> stated that is our intention. <hi
                                rend="italic">The Ambassador</hi> then apologized to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> that he must leave just as he
                            arrived, noting “when angels come, devils must leave”. <hi rend="italic"
                                >The Secretary</hi> wondered whether the Ambassador was not being

                            <salute>Dear Steve:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>Thank you for sending me the Livingston-Wiley-Placke report on Gulf
                            Policy, and inviting my comments on it.</p>
                        <p>Having been involved in Gulf matters most of the last decade, and having
                            spent some time with the Inspector’s in the course of their labors, I am
                            especially interested in their findings. They have done a first rate
                            job.</p>
                        <p>Less from the present vantage point of Bahrain than from past experience
                            I must “vent feelings” informally on two major issues which the report
                            properly addresses although they transcend the Gulf context in its
                            strictest sense—oil policy and the Iranian/Arab connection:</p>
                        <p>1) The Inspector’s urge departing from traditional wisdom by having the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> play a more active role in oil
                            negotiations. Their recommendations are more or less overtaken by
                            events. Events, however, may have departed not just from traditional
                            wisdom but eventual wisdom in hindsight. In weakening the oil company
                            “buffer” we take great risks, and we should seek a more direct role in
                            negotiations with caution, and certainly not until we are satisfied
                            that:</p>
                        <p>a) The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> understands the complexities
                            of international oil at least as well as the companies;</p>
                        <p>b) the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has a firm and long-term
                            energy policy permitting sensitive control of the price and volume of
                            our imports and exports;</p>
                        <p>c) the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has a Middle East policy
                            which protects rather than threatens Western access to Arab oil prices
                            determined by market forces;</p>
                        <p>d) The long term ongoing <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> interest in
                            the Gulf is more directed toward access to oil than toward access to the
                            capital resources the oil has produced.</p>
                        <p>If any of these conditions has not been met, we need to strengthen, not
                            weaken, the oil company “buffer.”</p>
                        <pb facs="0257" n="222" xml:id="pg_222"/>
                        <p>2) As we contemplate whether Iranian/Arab cooperation will continue to
                            keep the Gulf stable we should not fall into the delusion of thinking in
                            narrow terms of Iranian/Saudi cooperation. Saudi/Iranian cooperation has
                            been but a facade to keep the lesser Gulf sheikhs easy; in terms of real
                            cooperation it is a hopeless contest between non-equals—and will be for
                            at least a generation. The reason the British could “officially” leave
                            the Gulf with grace (and by leaving, stay in a very meaningful and
                            helpful sense) was that the Nasserist Revolution left before they did.
                            Gulf stability hence depends on an easy relationship between Iran on the
                            one hand and Egypt (bankrolled by Saudi Arabia) on the other. So far our
                            luck is not only holding out but even getting better in this respect;
                            and we should as a matter of basic policy seek to reinforce its onward
                            chances.</p>
                        <p>Beyond these informal and gratuitous comments, I attach a “formal”
                            comment on the Inspection.</p>
                        <p>With thanks and best wishes.</p>

                                Interests—Development Projects and Reverse Investment</p>
                            <p>Among several meritorious recommendations to foster our economic
                                interests in the Gulf the Inspectors suggest establishing two senior
                                regional jobs dealing with (1) financial affairs and (2)
                                project-oriented commercial activity.</p>
                            <p>The motive is excellent; the specific suggestions deserve a hard
                                look. The need is broadly to absorb the surplus funds of the Gulf
                                through sound investment in the area and in Western markets, with
                                substantial benefit to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                                economy. Possibly a single Department of State activity would better
                                serve this purpose than would the two positions proposed. They in
                                any event are but a splitting of the now-abandoned Gulf Regional
                                Economic/Commercial Officer slot as originally conceived. Earlier
                                Inspectors made withering verbal critiques of that concept.</p>
                            <p>Assuming we come up with additional positions to serve our economic
                                interests in the area, and these positions are designed to best
                                serve real needs rather than to fall easily into Washington’s
                                bureaucratic pigeonholes the Inspectors concept of where such an
                                operation should be based is questionable. The experience of
                                American business in dealing with the Gulf is instructive and
                                suggests the following formula: (A) If a US activity in the Gulf
                                requires high quality but sporadic contact, it should be based in
                                the United States. (B) If the activity requires almost constant
                                presence in the area: 1) If the target is almost solely Saudi Arabia
                                it should be based there; 2) if the target is the Gulf States
                                generally, Bahrain is the natural base of operations; (c) In any
                                event, a Beirut-based operation is the worst of all possible
                                worlds.</p>
                            <p>Our alternative suggestion would be setting up a two to three officer
                                operation in Washington to promote both reverse investment from the
                                Gulf and US participation in projects there, with the officers
                                involved traveling extensively both in the area and the United
                                States. If and only if this experiment flourished should we consider
                                extending the office into the region, with perhaps a representative
                                for Saudi Arabia based in Jidda and one for the Gulf based in
                                Bahrain.</p>

                            <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">IV.</hi> The Middle East
                                Force Presence</p>
                            <p>We seem to have preserved for the moment the Middle East Force
                                presence in the Gulf and its Bahraini base of operations. The effort
                                cost us some political IOU’s in Riyadh and Tehran and some increase
                                in what our taxpayers give Bahrain.</p>
                            <p>In the wake of this effort it would be bad policy indeed to tamper
                                significantly with the Middle East Force presence for at least a
                                year or so.</p>
                            <p>But now is the time, as the Inspectors suggest, to begin reassessing
                                whether the Middle East Force presence will continue to serve our
                                real national interest.</p>
                            <p>The 1970 decision to keep the Force in the Gulf as the British
                                withdrew was quite justifiable in manifesting a continuing US
                                interest in the absence of other significant official presence in
                                the lower Gulf. But this is 1975; there is now relatively
                                substantial US diplomatic representation; there are good prospects
                                for increased official US presence in the economic/technical
                                development sphere. The time may be coming, in 1977 or beyond, for
                                the Middle East Force “honor guard” to retire.</p>
                            <p>Specifically, continued Middle East Force presence, as it currently
                                exists, presents the following problems:</p>
                            <p>1) As a militarily meaningful <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                                Navy presence becomes a semi-permanent fixture in the Indian Ocean,
                                Middle East Force becomes, to those who trust its mission,
                                increasingly quaint. It is pomp without circumstance;</p>
                            <p>2) Its innocent “flag showing” mission is sufficiently incredible to
                                make it something of a political liability. Since no other Gulf
                                State will publicly support its presence, Bahrain is asking $4
                                million a year for the political burden of tolerating the Force;</p>
                            <p>3) Linking the meaningful <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy
                                presence in the Indian Ocean with the Middle East Force Command
                                would be instantly intolerable to the Gulf States, notably Iran.
                                Hence the Force is locked in its present and increasingly “comic
                                opera” role;</p>
                            <p>4) In seeking a fulfilling mission, the Force tends to emphasize an
                                “intelligence gathering” function which seems at best exaggerated
                                and at worst politically vulnerable;</p>
                            <p>5) Caught in this situation, the Force increasingly becomes a
                                political liability in the area. Its ill-wishers can lie about its
                                mission with a certain persuasiveness. Its well-wishers have
                                difficulty describing what it really does convincingly.</p>
                            <p>6) Quite apart from the question, which has received all the
                                attention over the last five years, “What harm does the Middle East
                                Force do?”, there is the question the Inspectors have finally
                                raised, “What good does it do?” And here is where the burden of
                                proof should lie.</p>
                            <pb facs="0260" n="225" xml:id="pg_225"/>
                            <p>In considering the future of Middle East Force the nature and
                                function of its elements should be carefully differentiated.</p>
                            <p>A) The small shore support facility in Bahrain (NCSO), headed by a
                                Commander, is not subject to major controversy; it could be
                                maintained so long as the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy
                                has need of a logistic support base in the area regardless of the
                                fate of Middle East Force.</p>
                            <p>(B) The role of Commander Middle East Force is subject to
                                controversy, largely because the rank of the Commander (Rear
                                Admiral) and the name of the command imply a scope and intent of
                                activity for exceeding the modest mission of this small contingent
                                of two transient destroyers and the large flagship <hi rend="italic"
                                    >La Salle</hi>. The Commander has a quasi-diplomatic visiting
                                role in a wide area; customarily he fulfills it by traveling in his
                                aircraft rather than riding the flagship. As we enter the latter
                                half of the 1970’s the utility of both the Commander’s command and
                                diplomatic roles is subject to honest question.</p>
                            <p>(C) The flagship <hi rend="italic">La Salle</hi> spends about half
                                its time in Bahrain; the rest on visits, exercises, or out of the
                                area for maintenance. The Commander uses it as an office and site
                                for representational entertaining both in Bahrain and other ports in
                                the area. Seldom does the Commander ride the flagship underway.
                                Since the flagship is seldom used as such in an operational sense
                                yet its complement constitutes 3/4 of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                    >U.S.</gloss> Navy presence in Bahrain, its role is subject to
                                serious review. If a “flagship”, other than the transient
                                destroyers, is essential, perhaps a hospital ship or some other
                                vessel contributing to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> efforts
                                to provide technology to the area would be more appropriate.</p>
                            <p>(D) The visiting destroyers are the primary manifestation of <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy presence in the area outside
                                Bahrain. They call but briefly in Bahrain for replenishment during
                                their tours with Middle East Force. The British and French mount
                                comparable visits in the Gulf without relying on a permanent command
                                structure or flagship in the area. It is not clear from the Bahrain
                                vantage point why the destroyer visits could not continue without a
                                Middle East Force Command. If the Command is needed for this
                                purpose, could not the destroyers serve as flagship?</p>

                        <p>1. Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> had
                            extremely effective exchange of views with Amir of Bahrain April 17 in
                            over half hour meeting attended by Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and
                            Crown Prince/Defense Minister. Substantive importance which Amir
                            attached to exchange with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName> evidenced by fact this is first time he has
                            talked in Arabic, with Foreign Minister translating, to official
                            Americans since informing Chargé of decision to oust Middle East Force
                            in 1973.</p>
                        <p>2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> made strong
                            and effective approach along general lines Manama 446, stressing <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> determination to proceed actively in
                            pursuit of Middle East peace and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            concern for and willingness to contribute to efforts of Gulf states to
                            provide for their own security and stability. In response Amir, with
                            Foreign Minister occasionally amplifying his remarks as well as
                            translating them, repeatedly noted <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                            >GOB</gloss>’s long-standing friendship with <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> and its welcome of an increasingly active <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role in Saudi Arabia in particular and
                            in Gulf and Middle East generally.</p>
                        <p>3. Mentioning he had discussed importance US Navy presence in Gulf with
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>, who supported it,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> expressed
                            appreciation that question of continued Middle East Force presence has
                            apparently been successfully resolved. Bahrainis replied, after noting
                            their welcome of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy presence,
                            that “negotiations now in final stages” and <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> soon will take formal decision. (Ambassador’s comment:
                            Earlier in week, I tried some ploy on Amir who acknowledged that Middle
                            East Force question had been successfully resolved and laughed about
                            fact that Foreign Minister had not yet pushed through the final
                            paperwork. In this light I have no basis for doubting <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> intentions on Middle East Force
                            negotiations although it is possible <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> may be waiting until Parliament recesses in June to
                            exchange documents.)</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> noted useful
                            nature his just concluded discussions in Saudi Arabia; determination
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to move actively to support <pb
                                facs="0262" n="227" xml:id="pg_227"/> Saudi development plans; and
                            our impression that leadership transition in Saudi Arabia had been
                            notably smooth. Amir welcomed these assessments and our activities in
                            support of <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> but turning to broader
                            Middle East situation generally stressed importance <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> attaches to role of <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> as moderate, pro-Western Arab
                            leader seeking peaceful settlement and <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss>’s concern about pressures facing <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>, mentioning <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy reassessment and President and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s
                            determination to push on with quest for peace, expressed personal
                            confidence that constructive movement toward peaceful settlement would
                            take place in coming months prior to reconvening of Geneva Conference
                            and personal optimism that hostilities are not on verge of being
                            renewed. Amir, stressing <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s support
                            for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role in peace settlement,
                            maintained he is “optimistic” about peace prospects. (Ambassador’s
                            comment: This is first time in recent months that Amir has expressed
                            optimism about Middle East situation.)</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> referred to
                            Soviet naval presence in Indian Ocean and Soviet facilities in Somalia.
                            This led Amir to assessment of (a) Soviet intentions in the Middle East:
                            Soviets are seeking exploit every opportunity to destabilize area and to
                            “gain foothold” and it is essential that <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Arab relations develop in manner closing door to
                            Soviets and (b) role of <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>: <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> feels it essential that Arabs, led by
                            Saudi Arabia, bring <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> into moderate
                            fold to prevent Soviets, once Suez Canal reopened, from exploiting South
                            Yemen’s political isolation and poverty to establish major Soviet
                            foothold in south of peninsula. Foreign Minister expanded on this point
                            noting <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> had been approached by
                                <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> for relations but had refused
                            to establish relations with South Yemen until Saudi Arabia does so. He
                            indicated that Arab Foreign Ministers at April 21 meeting plan to
                            persuade Saudi Arabia to focus on South Yemen problem and to reach some
                            kind of accommodation with <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> noted that if
                            this is <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s strategy, time is of the
                            essence in persuading Saudi Arabia to take lead in reconciling Arab
                            relations with <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> since Suez Canal
                            apparently will be opened shortly.</p>
                        <p>6. In response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName>’ question Amir and Foreign Minister gave
                            notably bland and optimistic assessment of recent Iran-Iraq accord along
                            lines that anything relieving antagonism between major Gulf powers was
                            beneficial to stability of Gulf area including Bahrain. (Ambassador’s
                            comment: Amir seemed to be speaking for record on this one since his own
                            private assessment of Iraqi intentions generally and viability of
                            Iran-Iraq accord in particular has to date been notably less
                            sanguine.)</p>
                        <p>7. Near end of discussion Foreign Minister urged at some length that
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests in Middle East as a
                            whole, unlike “transient <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            <pb facs="0263" n="228" xml:id="pg_228"/> interests in Southeast Asia”,
                            are long-standing and major and now is time for <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> to be formulating a long-term strategy for
                            strengthening its relations with all the Middle East. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> responded
                            persuasively to this presentation, noting <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss>’s intense interest in Middle East and efforts to work
                            out long-term good relationships with entire area.</p>
                        <p>8. Amir noted importance <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> attaches to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>’ visit as
                            manifestation of strong <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Bahraini
                            relations and asked Secretary to convey his wish that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and Secretary <persName

                            Bahrain.</p>
                        <p>9. Ambassador’s comment: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName>’ visit provided extremely useful opportunity
                            for high-level <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> exchange with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>; Bahraini leaders obviously
                            appreciated opportunity and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName> was quite persuasive in indicating to them
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s interest in and desire for
                            cooperation with Bahrain and other states of area.</p>

                            messages (Abu Dhabi 276), in my judgment most effective step we can at
                            this juncture take to strengthen our position <pb facs="0264" n="229"

                            close to him that he has been hoping for invitation for several
                            years.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> has now been in power
                            for three years, during which period he has grown steadily in stature
                            and authority as <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> Chief of State.
                            Agreements he has just concluded with oil companies assures him of oil

                            year that will give <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> voice within

                            wherewithall to continue large handouts of assistance to Egypt, Syria,
                            and Jordan, where we have important objectives. It is worth the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> taking some trouble to cultivate
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName>. He responds
                            handsomely to personal treatment, and it is observable fact that <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>’s relations with countries <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> has visited are particularly
                            strong. From point of view of his own internal and inter-Arab politics,
                            prestige of visit to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would help
                            him and he can be counted on to reciprocate in terms of our own
                            interests here. I am moreover concerned that, with invitations having
                            been extended to <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> by
                            almost every important European state, the absence of one from us has
                            been noticed and will soon begin to have a negative effect.</p>
                        <p>3. Best time for visit would be middle of late July, immediately
                            following State visit which <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"
                                >Zayid</persName> is planning to make to France on July 7. If this
                            not convenient time for us, another good period from <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName>’s point of view would be at
                            end of his European summer vacation around mid-September. However, this
                            begins to be busy season for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            officials and I believe July date would be preferable. We hear from one
                            of <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName>’s advisors that if
                            invitation in early summer is received <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"
                                >Zayid</persName> would like to prolong stay in <gloss

                            summer vacation, an excellent opportunity to maximize his exposure to
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> without additional burden to
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. One thing we should try to
                            avoid is having <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> do a
                            “Qabous” on us, arranging visit privately and thereby presenting us with
                            fait accompli at time which may be inconvenient for us. It will have far
                            more impact on <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> if he
                            feels we have extended invitation to him on our own initiative.</p>
                        <p>4. I enlist your personal support to enable us to invite <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Shaikh Zayid</persName> for visit to <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in July. While it would be mistake not

                        <p>1. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>’s May 18
                            “Issues and Answers” remarks indicating possible US military
                            intervention if there is another oil embargo, have been fully covered in
                            Qatari media. Daily “Al Arab” on May 20 carried sharply critical
                            editorial entitled “<persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>
                            and Vain Threats”. Editorial covered waterfront of alleged US failures
                            from Indochina to Mid East, and asserted such threats betrayed another
                            US failure, i.e. its mistaken perception of Arab nation and Arab
                            reaction to such threats. Editorial claimed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName> remarks latest revelation
                            that US does not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not want true
                            peace in area and implied that Secretary’s step by step diplomacy
                            another facet of US deception of Arabs. Editorial stated that US still
                            did not realize that era of colonialism, with its intimidation of
                            subject peoples, has long been over, and that US apparently has not
                            learned any lessons in Indochina, since it continuing its repressive
                            intentions in this area through threatening statements and massive arms
                            assistance to Israel.</p>

                        <p>126783. Subject: An Arms Supply Relationship With Qatar. Ref: Doha 0503
                            (Notal); Doha 0546 (Notal); State 104007 (Notal).</p>
                        <p>1. We are prepared to enter into a modest arms supply relationship with
                            Qatar which is consistent with our 1972 arms sales policy for the lower
                            Gulf. This policy is governed by the following guidelines:</p>
                        <p>A) As a general rule, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will approve
                            the sale of equipment to the lower Gulf Emirates which will enhance the
                            internal security capability of these states. <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> will not approve the sale of equipment, sophisticated
                            or offensive in nature, which could by its presence in this area, create
                            a destabilizing factor. Sale requests will be considered on case-by-case
                            basis within this guideline.</p>
                        <p>B) <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will support efforts by American
                            commercial interests to sell reasonable amounts of defense articles and
                            services of a type that will meet real security needs of these
                            countries. Where commercial channels are inadequate, cash sales of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military equipment and services
                            under Foreign Military Sales Act will be considered if the sale of this
                            equipment is consistent with our objective of furthering cooperation
                            among these Gulf states.</p>
                        <pb facs="0267" n="232" xml:id="pg_232"/>
                        <p>C) In general, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will wish to avoid
                            sales that require presence of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            military personnel in these states on other than a temporary basis for
                            providing technical assistance or maintenance. Private American
                            companies will not be discouraged from providing, in connection with
                            supply of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> equipment, administrative
                            and training personnel to the region, but efforts will be made in this
                            respect to avoid direct competition with ongoing foreign advisory
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>2. Given policies described above, Qatar’s small size, modest military
                            role in Gulf, and absence of palpable external threat, we are prepared
                            to authorize the sale of some of items in which <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1"
                                >GOQ</gloss> is interested. Conclusions on specific military
                            hardware and training requests which <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1"
                                >GOQ</gloss> has put to Embassy Doha have also been reached through
                            process of defining what we believe to be most proper and feasible
                            military supply relationship with Qatar as well as other lower Gulf
                            Emirates.</p>
                        <p>3. Embassy may therefore inform <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>
                            that, if requests it has received have been approved by ruler, <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> cash sales, within normal lead times,
                            of following amounts and types of equipment are hereby authorized:</p>

                        <p>C) 12 trucks and 12 jeeps (including mounts) sufficient for support of
                            Howitzers and recoilless rifles purchased in A) and B) above;</p>
                        <p>D) Ammunition in amounts <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> deems
                            appropriate for weapons purchased under A) and B) above;</p>
                        <p>E) Unclassified training materials and aids appropriate to purchases made
                            under A) through D) above.</p>
                        <p>4. Embassy Doha should verify <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>
                            understanding that we no longer produce 30 mm and 40 mm AAA guns about
                            which its Brigadier Attiyah inquired and that we will thus be unable to
                            meet Qatar’s particular anti-aircraft needs. (Begin <gloss
                                target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss> for Embassy only: We are not in a
                            position to authorize exception to our arms policies which would be
                            required to permit sale of automatic rapid-fire Vulcan air-defense
                            system to Qatar. See para 3, State 037105 End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1"
                                >FYI</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>5. Embassy should also inform <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> that,
                            while we would support any military equipment sales made by sending
                            quality assurance teams to Qatar for temporary periods, <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> does not believe it to be in best
                            interests of either country to consider assignment of US military
                            instructors at this time. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> believes
                            development of regional cooperation among lower Gulf states indicates
                            that it would not be advisable for US to assign military
                            instructor/advisory personnel for extended tours of duty this region.
                            This is a policy decision which we have adhered to since small Gulf
                            states became independent in 1971 and which we wish to maintain in view
                            of recent congressional sensitivities to US <pb facs="0268" n="233"
                                xml:id="pg_233"/> military sales arrangements to countries in the
                            Gulf region generally. We would therefore want to carry out all direct
                            training of Qatar armed forces personnel necessitated by future
                            equipment sales in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Also, in
                            keeping with our policy of encouraging regional cooperation in the area,
                            we hope <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> will consider possibility
                            of seeking training in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, or Iran for its military
                            personnel.</p>

                                >GOB</gloss> has decided to conclude present negotiations on Middle

                        <p>2. In conveying this decision, the Foreign Minister went to great pains
                            to express <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s satisfaction with its
                            long-standing relationship with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Navy and its desire to see an increasingly closer overall relationship
                            with <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. He continued that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> did not want to rush <gloss

                            in 1971 stationing agreement. <pb facs="0269" n="234" xml:id="pg_234"/>
                            At same time <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> considers the concept

                            Bahrain politically unsupportable at home and in the region. Foreign

                            noted that while <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> considers the
                            proposed Gulf security pact “years away” from being implemented,

                        <p>3. Foreign Minister urged that I try to convey to <gloss

                            departure of Middle East Force from Bahrain will serve not only overall
                            Bahraini national interests but broader <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> interests in stability of Gulf. He pleaded for <gloss

                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s position which he described as
                            “compromise” in meeting Bahrain’s political problems while permitting
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy to remain for almost three
                            years longer than original October 1974 deadline for its departure.</p>
                        <p>4. Foreign Minister said <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> of course
                            wished to conclude promptly the protracted negotiations on conditions
                            for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy presence, expecting that
                            we would honor our commitment to increase rent to $4 million per year
                            from July 1, 1974, and to implement jurisdiction arrangements as we have
                            agreed in principle.</p>
                        <p>5. I told Foreign Minister I was certain <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> would appreciate and sympathize with the spirit in

                            and conveyed, that I would have to seek further instructions and would

                        <p>1581. Subject: <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Policy Toward “Gulf
                            Security.”</p>
                        <p>1. Summary. In two respects which we comment on in this message we see
                            opportunity for us to get on more positive footing with Gulf states,
                            which are both rapidly growing in political self-confidence and
                            beginning to consult among themselves on regional problems. End
                            summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Although no <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> official has raised
                            subject of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military presence in
                            Gulf or Indian Ocean directly with us (which is in character with this
                            government’s cautious approach to issues affecting—or appearing to
                            affect—strategic balance between superpowers), we believe there has been
                            subtle but palpable shift in <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>’s
                            attitude on this subject over past year. When these small Gulf states
                            were abruptly cast loose from British control and protection three and
                            half years ago there were so many uncertainties as to how political
                            future of area would evolve that most of newly independent states
                            probably saw US naval presence in area as vaguely comforting. In past
                            year, however, there has been increase in self-confidence among states
                            of this area that we think has changed attitude toward outside military
                            presence. There is greater feeling that “this is our Gulf, and we can
                            take care of it ourselves.” Red banner headline in government-owned
                            daily <hi rend="italic">Al-Ittihad</hi> recently proclaimed “Bahrain
                            states there are no bases on its territory.” One might argue that this
                            kind of headline is designed to help <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> off the hook, but we think this would be wrong
                            interpretation in this case. Rather, we believe it indicates that in its
                            own quiet way the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> is adding its
                            voice to those in Gulf Councils who are urging removal of all “foreign”
                            (including Soviet) military forces from Gulf. We suspect this attitude
                            has grown among other Gulf riparians generally in past year, and that it
                            is realization of this that has led Bahrain <pb facs="0271" n="236"
                                xml:id="pg_236"/> Government to seek to put terminal date on <gloss
                                target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR_1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss> presence on
                            island.</p>
                        <p>3. Casting a backward glance at history of this area since British left,
                            we are impressed by the overall success story it represents. This is
                            particularly true if achievement is placed in juxtaposition to anxieties
                            everybody felt in 1969 about what might happen in wake of British
                            withdrawal. Of course money always helps, and these are uniquely rich
                            countries, but even with money there could have been some serious
                            untoward developments. Instead the ledger is positive on several
                            accounts that are highly important to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> interests. Governmental upheavals have been very few
                            given number of states involved, and where they have occurred (Qatar,
                            Yemen) they have turned out to be for the better. Elsewhere there has
                            been for most part not only political stability but steady growth in
                            governmental experience and competence. Equally impressive has been
                            energy which states in this area have recently brought to bear to
                            resolve disputes among themselves. Most significant of these is
                            Iran-Iraq settlement which—if it lasts, and if Iraqi policies continue
                            to evolve positively—could have profound effect on Gulf political
                            development. There has also been Abu Dhabi-Saudi border settlement,
                            Iraqi-Saudi border settlement, and practical assistance—both military
                            and economic—that Oman’s neighbors have given it to help suppress Dhofar
                            insurgency. On the Arab-Israel issue the Gulf states have given bulk of
                            their important financial support to states committed to negotiations
                            rather than to radicals. Perhaps most important of all, early fears that
                            Iranian and Arab interests would clash across the Gulf have so far
                            proven unfounded.</p>
                        <p>4. This is naturally not to say that everything is perfect in this area.
                            We have serious policy differences over oil with Gulf <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> members. There is still more than
                            enough corruption and governmental incompetence to go around, and
                            problems that traditional regimes will have in coping with rapid
                            development may yet produce good deal of political volatility. But so
                            far, and taken as a whole, the record is an impressive one of political
                            maturity and pragmatism. For one thing states in this area have spent
                            more time attending to their own problems than they have lecturing
                            others about theirs, a phenomenon that is as rare as it is wholesome
                            these days.</p>
                        <p>5. Two observations occur to us about this trend, and implications it has
                            for the US. First is that as a matter of public posture that would serve
                            our objectives, it seems to us that US could do more to take note of,
                            and indicate support for, progress in political stability to date and
                            recent incipient moves toward regional cooperation. We liked what Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName> had to say on Hill the
                            other day but unfortunately impact of his remarks was lessened by fact
                            that they were made in context of defense for <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> arms sales policy in area. Perhaps Gulf political <pb
                                facs="0272" n="237" xml:id="pg_237"/> development as success story
                            of regional development might be made prominent theme in one of
                            Secretary’s speeches. Accomplishments to date could be praised and point
                            made that with resources these states possess possibilities for
                            collaboration among them in regional framework are substantial. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has said many times in past that this
                            is region where it looks primarily to area states themselves to assure
                            their own security; point can now be made that in past 3 years actions
                            area states have taken have had just this effect. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> might also express willingness to
                            cooperate in building regional framework by providing technical
                            assistance on development projects that might best be undertaken on
                            regional basis. Main point would not be expectation that we would soon
                            become involved in any such projects (they will be a long time getting
                            off the ground) but to adopt positive public posture toward what we see
                            as long-term trend here, and to make individual governments feel that US
                            interests are in harmony with line of development that Gulf states
                            increasingly see in their own self-interest.</p>
                        <p>6. Second, related observation concerns how we respond to Bahrain
                            Government’s request that we put terminal date on <gloss
                                target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR_1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss> presence in Bahrain.
                            We have not seen Department’s instructions in response to <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ_1">Joe Twinam</persName>’s telegram reporting <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> request, but we gather from <gloss
                                target="#t_ARP_1">ARP</gloss>’s pouched summary that Washington’s
                            chosen tactic is to play for time, presumably in hope that developments
                            could occur—particularly further state of agreement in Arab-Israel
                            negotiations—that would take pressure off <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> and cause it to forget about demands. It certainly
                            seems true that renewal of Arab-Israel warfare would seal demand for
                            removal of <gloss target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR_1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss>. But
                            we question whether converse can be confidently asserted—that if
                            agreement for second stage of withdrawal in Sinai is reached, pressure
                            will be off Bahrainis to divest themselves of <gloss
                                target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR_1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss> presence. While we
                            doubt that Gulf riparians will themselves move to establish formal
                            security pact or joint forces anytime in near future (there is little
                            enthusiasm for this idea on this side of Gulf), idea of periodic
                            consultations on security among Gulf states seems broadly favored. If
                            mood of self-reliance among Gulf states grows, we think these
                            consultative get-togethers will treat our homeporting arrangement in
                            Bahrain increasingly as distasteful anachronism regardless of what
                            happens in Arab-Israel theatre.</p>
                        <p>7. Fighting to preserve <gloss target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >COMIDEASTFOR</gloss> by one tactic or another is not likely to
                            produce major rupture between <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and
                            Gulf states, but question is whether we perceive <gloss
                                target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR_1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss> as providing
                            sufficient utility in nineteen seventies and eighties to offset growing
                            political liability that we believe it will entail in our relations with
                            most of governments in this area. Unlike facility at Diego Garcia,
                                <gloss target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR_1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss> presence in
                            Bahrain has no effect on our global force posture. <pb facs="0273"
                                n="238" xml:id="pg_238"/> Its show-the-flag function could be
                            adequately (if somewhat less conveniently) performed by ships on Indian
                            Ocean station. The frequency of such visits might be lower but would
                            still be adequate. Main loss as far as we can see would be lesser
                            proximity of US naval vessels to sizable American communities in Gulf
                            which might have to be evacuated in time of emergency. But again we
                            wonder if this factor cannot be largely compensated for by increase in
                            US naval ship days that we are projecting for our units in Indian
                            Ocean.</p>
                        <p>8. We believe also that US agreement to phase out <gloss
                                target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR_1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss> would have effect of
                            bringing added pressure against Soviet use of facilities in Iraq and
                            Aden. We know, for example, that <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>
                            reps visiting here have countered queries about Soviet presence in Aden
                            by pointing to “US base” in Bahrain. US facility in Diego Garcia is not
                            in same category because it is far off, and it is not “base” on “Arab
                            soil”. We do not believe Arabs of this area, at any rate, regard US
                            presence at Diego Garcia with nearly same sensitivity as they are
                            beginning to feel about our token presence in Bahrain. Large part of
                            problem is psychological. Gulf Arabs remember time when British forces
                            were stationed at Bahrain and tend to see US presence there as lingering
                            reminder of colonial past.</p>
                        <p>9. In my view <gloss target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR_1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss>
                            presence exerted stabilizing influence during uncertain transition
                            period between precipitate British departure and time when Gulf states
                            could demonstrate they could stand politically on their own feet.
                            Transition period is however now rapidly phasing into new psychological
                            climate in which area states feel greater confidence that they can
                            manage their own affairs, including security. Central question for
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> now is whether it is worth
                            trying to maintain a presence that runs counter (or is viewed
                            subjectively by area states as running counter) to these new political
                            trends. We are inclined to believe it is not, and that wisest course
                            would be for <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to accede gracefully
                            and matter-of-factly to <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> request to
                            have <gloss target="#t_COMIDEASTFOR_1">COMIDEASTFOR</gloss> leave

                        <p>Summary: <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s apparently rigid
                            determination to have the Middle East Force out by 1977 represents a
                            “political setback” for Bahraini leadership, who feel forced to bow to
                            anti-Middle East Force pressures. In our reaction we must be careful to
                            avoid turning this into political humiliation for <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. Possible scenarios for reacting are
                            outlined below: there are no real options. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. Reftels indicate rigidity <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s
                            insistence that it notify <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in
                            writing of its decision to terminate <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Navy presence by June 30, 1977. In considering how we
                            react, we must realize that if this decision is a “political setback”,
                            as State 174770 suggests, it is a setback essentially for the al Khalifa
                            leadership which has been forced by local and area pressure to
                            compromise on its stated intent to keep the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Navy in Bahrain as long as possible. In that context
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> obviously feels, however
                            inaccurately, that it is doing as well by us as it possibly can by
                            permitting Middle East Force to remain for almost four years after
                            October 1973 termination notice. Desperately wanting to get this issue
                            off its back, it correctly suspects that any imprecision or flexibility
                            of language in notifying us of this decision will open the door to later
                            uncomfortable <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> pressure.</p>
                        <p>2. Since transmitting ref A, we have reconsidered what possible ploys
                            might be open to us in seeking to maintain some flexibility (I cannot
                            stress too strongly that this is essentially a theoretical exercise
                            since the hard political reality is that <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> will have Middle East Force out by mid-1977 unless the
                            local and area situation changes in some unforeseen and unlikely
                            manner). In considering these approaches, it is essential that we ponder
                            realistically just how much continued <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Navy presence operating out of Bahrain would be in our
                            interest after mid-1977 given the present circumstances. Faced with its
                            own “political <pb facs="0275" n="240" xml:id="pg_240"/> setback”, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> is of course looking to us to
                            accept its decision gracefully. We should avoid reacting in a manner
                            which might turn Bahrain’s “setback” into our own political
                            humiliation.</p>
                        <p>3. We can visualize five possible scenarios for reacting to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> decision (there are no real
                            options):</p>
                        <p>A. Low key temporizing. I could, under instructions, reiterate the
                            argument that no written notification of <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss>’s decision is necessary, that we are appropriately
                            informed of 1977 planning date and that there is nothing further to
                            discuss at this time while we review situation. This, of course, is
                            essentially what I have been doing to several key officials since we
                            first were informed of 1977 date. It is not working and, in my view,
                            continuing this approach will not forestall <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss>’s written notification. It will intensify <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s determination to get this matter set
                            in concrete.</p>
                        <p>B. High level temporizing. We could try the ploy of delivery, not later
                            than August 3, of a letter to the Foreign Minister from the Secretary
                            (or, alternatively, perhaps Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Sisco</persName>) noting the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s
                            policy decision re 1977, reassuring Foreign Minister of our acceptance
                            in principle that Middle East Force agreement is for a limited duration
                            and asking <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> to take no further steps
                            until Foreign Minister has had a chance during <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                                >UNGA</gloss> to talk with Secretary (or Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>) about this question,
                            particularly in the light of broader, global issues on which we would
                            like to exchange views with Foreign Minister. This ploy might delay
                            things until National Assembly opens in October, but is unlikely to
                            alter <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s decision. I cannot in good
                            conscience recommend engaging prestige of the Secretary in such a
                            mission, particularly in light of the mood likely to prevail at <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> and the many more serious issues we
                            will face there.</p>
                        <p>C. Low key acquiescence. The course I recommend is that I be instructed
                            immediately (not later than August 2 if it is to have any effect) to
                            respond to Foreign Minister along following lines:</p>
                        <p>(1) <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, while understanding perfectly

                        <p>(2) In view of <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s desire to make such
                            written notification, we have suggested an approach which <gloss

                            maintaining future freedom of action (along lines I have suggest);

                        <p>D. Full-dress breast-beating. More for our own psychic satisfaction than
                            for any good it would do, we could seek to arrange a full dress meeting
                            with the Amir and Foreign Minister in which we express, by cold and
                            bitterly worded aide-mémoire, our recognition of Bahrain’s right to do
                            what it is doing, however misguided it may seem to us, and however
                            harmful to our long-term mutual interests in the stability of the
                            region. I am convinced such an approach would have no <gloss
                                target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> no effect in changing <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> decision at present. It could well be
                            viewed by top Bahraini leaders as an attempt to bully them when they are
                            trying to convince themselves they are doing all they can for us in a
                            difficult situation. If there is any future hope of turning around
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> decision, such an approach
                            might kill it. At best, it would warn <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> with more melodrama than the situation warrants that
                            our love may be growing cold.</p>
                        <p>E. Seizing the initiative with a clean break. If being warned by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> that Middle East Force must
                            leave by 1977 is politically intolerable to us, there is a way to save
                            face. We could, not later than August 3, implement on our own initiative
                            termination clause of the stationing agreement giving notice that Middle
                            East Force will leave by August 3, 1976. I assume such a step would not
                            be considered in our interest.</p>
                        <p>4. Given our lack of options and increasing rigidity of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>, I recommend I be instructed
                            immediately to make approach outlined sub-para C above. I would expect
                            to receive <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s written notification
                            about August 4, in any event. Having received it, it is important that
                            we lay low for awhile since Baharna in July 31 meeting began for first
                            time to mutter about desirability of our acknowledging in writing <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s notification of 1977 “deadline.” I
                            think we should continue to take position I did informally July 31: That
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> acknowledgement unnecessary
                            until it becomes timely in accordance with terms of stationing agreement
                            for one party or the other to serve termination notice.</p>

                            wanted to talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>
                            before having lunch with the <gloss target="#t_VCNO_1">VCNO</gloss>,
                            Admiral Shear, during which the subject of the Middle East Force (<gloss
                                target="#t_MEF_1">MEF</gloss>) would be discussed. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName></hi> asked the
                            Ambassador what State wants to do about responding to the termination
                            notice. More importantly, he wondered what would be the wise thing to
                            do. <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1"
                                    >Twinam</persName></hi> replied that State’s concern involved
                            political symbolism. <gloss target="#t_NEAARP_1">NEA/ARP</gloss> favored
                            a joint announcement. The Bahrainis have already told some people of the
                            termination notice. <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJ_1">Twinam</persName></hi> then described briefly
                            the internal pressures which affected the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Bahraini</hi> decision. There was no public support in Bahrain for
                            retention of <gloss target="#t_MEF_1">MEF</gloss> and no encouragement
                            from the Saudis either. <hi rend="italic">Mr. Lyle</hi> indicated that
                            past overtures had been made to the Saudi Arabian and Iranian rulers to
                            support <gloss target="#t_MEF_1">MEF</gloss> presence; their responses
                            were negative.</p>
                        <p>(S) <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1"
                                    >Twinam</persName></hi> described the situation that the
                            Bahrainis feel themselves in, with leftists seizing upon <gloss
                                target="#t_MEF_1">MEF</gloss> status as the most convenient issue to
                            dispute with the Government. We can expect nothing in the next 18 months
                            to change this situation and thus lead to withdrawal of the termination
                            notice. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                                    >Ellsworth</persName></hi> wondered whether we should not leave

                            responded that the Government of Bahrain would like a joint statement.
                            It would not have to be issued immediately. Basically, the Bahrainis do

                            wondered whether we could not simply wait a year, until such time as the

                                    >Ellsworth</persName></hi> asked what the impact of the Berbera
                            revelations had been on Bahrain. <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJ_1">Twinam</persName></hi> answered the Bahrainis
                            were unhappy but that they looked to the US to more or less keep the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> at bay outside the Gulf. The
                            Bahrainis felt that the Soviets tricked the Somalis; however, they are
                            not alarmed.</p>
                        <p>(S) The discussion shifted back to <gloss target="#t_MEF_1">MEF</gloss>
                            when <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1"
                                    >Twinam</persName></hi> said we delude ourselves if we think the

                            statement does limit our flexibility somewhat; however, the news of the

                                    <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1">Twinam</persName></hi> indicated

                            September and that he was amenable during his stay to work out a joint

                            when Senator Scott visited Bahrain and talked to the Foreign Minister,
                            one of the points raised was the tendency of the major powers to
                            increase their posture in the Gulf. It was once thought that we could
                            bargain <gloss target="#t_MEF_1">MEF</gloss> departure from Bahrain in
                            exchange for Soviet departure from Um Qasar. This might have been

                            Bahrainis. They have become rather tricky to deal with since discovering
                            just how much they have become dependent on Saudi Arabia. Shaikh Isa

                            to stay. It seemed that Bahraini changes of attitude were related to

                            Bahrain is on the wane. It will be very hard to try and explain this in
                            Bahrain, especially since the Bahrainis are more pro-US than
                            pro-British.</p>

                            others in the Middle East, the Bahrainis were not as rich as some but
                            not necessarily destitute. Their basic future problem will be the
                            attitude of their neighbors; for example, if the Kuwaitis went heavily
                            into the banking business, which they have the resources to do, this
                            could adversely affect the Bahraini banking community.</p>

                                    >Ellsworth</persName></hi> asked if the Ambassador cared to
                            discuss the school. Here <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName

                                >DOD</gloss> support. In general, he requested <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> help with the situation in Bahrain by
                            being especially careful on little matters in general, and especially
                            with regard to the school. <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TJ_1">Twinam</persName></hi> indicated his opinion
                            that not one cent in US taxes should be spent on the school (now
                            supported almost 50 percent by <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>
                            subsidies) if <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> enrollees become
                            negligible. However, in terms of withdrawal, he requested that we be
                            very flexible when phasing out the school. It would be most helpful to
                            have US personnel stay on until they can definitely be replaced
                            adequately and in order to make a rather difficult transition as smooth
                            as possible. It would be very hard to keep the school going, for
                            example, if the entire faculty left at one time. So he asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> for assistance in
                            avoiding an abrupt changeover. He wondered if <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> could be flexible enough on the teachers to secure a
                            year’s absence with career status protected but salaries unpaid by
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>. The teachers could then remain
                            and assist with the transition. This would be particularly helpful
                            because the Bahrainis were most interested in keeping the school. Its
                            presence is an advantage, in attracting business and for other
                            reasons.</p>

                        <p>We recently completed negotiations with the Government of Bahrain on our
                            Navy’s Middle East Force (<gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss>), which effectively superseded the one-year
                            termination notice the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> gave us in
                            October 1973 and provide a basis for <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss>’s remaining on at Bahrain. At the same time,
                            however, the Bahrainis told us they intended to set a two-year limit on
                            the Navy’s continued presence, or until June 30, 1977, and on August 12
                            they delivered a letter notifying us of this decision. We need to
                            consider how to deal with Bahrain’s June 1977 deadline: to fight it, or
                            to accede to it; and, if the latter, how to make the best of the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background/Analysis</p>
                        <p>The US Navy has had a small contingent in Bahrain since 1949 consisting
                            of one command ship homeported at Bahrain and two destroyers assigned to
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> on a six-month
                            rotational basis. With the departure of the British, we negotiated a
                            stationing agreement with Bahrain in December 1971. The one-year
                            termination clause in that agreement was invoked by the Bahrainis in
                            October 1973, in reaction to the Administration’s request for $2.2
                            billion in military aid for Israel.</p>
                        <p>After immediate sensitivities associated with the 1973 war subsided, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> informed us it would reconsider
                            its notification that the Navy leave by October 1974, subject to
                            satisfactory negotiation of several conditions for continued Navy
                            presence. Early this year, we <pb facs="0281" n="246" xml:id="pg_246"/>
                            agreed to: (a) raise the rent from a concessional $600,000 to $4 million
                            per annum; (b) accept Bahraini jurisdiction over criminal cases
                            considered politically sensitive; and (c) undertake to withdraw <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> in six months instead of
                            a year should the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> decide in the
                            future to invoke the termination clause. In an indirectly related
                            understanding, we also undertook to seek Congressional approval of a
                            small <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>-administered technical
                            assistance program for topping off salaries. For this purpose, <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                            >FY</gloss>–76 budget requests $400,000.</p>
                        <p>In June, the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> told us it was ready to
                            formalize these understandings through an exchange of notes, but it also
                            informed us that it had decided to set a two-year limit on our continued
                            naval presence. By then, Bahraini leadership had become increasingly
                            sensitive to domestic and external developments it saw as impinging on
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>. It had barely
                            averted the Navy’s presence becoming an issue for debate before the
                            country’s National Assembly recessed for the summer. It felt
                            uncomfortable over the misinformed allegations of US invasion plans in
                            the Gulf. The lack of explicit support for <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> from the two largest
                            countries in the Gulf region (Iran and Saudi Arabia), the Shah’s recent
                            statements on the eventual removal of “third parties” from the Gulf, and
                            recent discussions of a possible Gulf security arrangement added to
                            Bahrain discomfort.</p>
                        <p>At the end of July, we formalized the different understandings on the
                            retention of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>. Despite
                            our several attempts to try and convince the Bahrainis not to set a
                            deadline for <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>’s
                            departure, the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> officially notified
                            us of its decision on August 12 (see Attachment 1). In presenting the
                            letter, the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> Foreign Minister noted
                            that it was considered confidential and he wanted to work out some
                            mutually agreed formula to make the decision known after he returns from
                            the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> in September. He hoped that
                            the US would understand that the decision in no way reduced the high
                            value Bahrain placed on a continued friendly relationship.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> mission has in
                            recent years been heavily political in addition to its military
                            functions. Its role has been one of showing the flag and reflecting our
                            interest in the stability of the Persian Gulf region. It has also
                            participated in <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss> exercises and
                            provided intelligence-gathering on Soviet fleet movements in the Indian
                            Ocean. Its present functions could be performed, albeit less
                            efficiently, by other support arrangements.</p>
                        <p>There remains a slight possibility that Bahrain might be willing to
                            reconsider its position in the next two years if the situation in the
                            Middle East improves. On the other hand, there is no indication that the
                            recent dissolution of the Bahrain National Assembly has changed the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> position, and it appears that
                            Bahraini leadership did not want to have <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> an issue at the time it cracked down on leftists
                                <pb facs="0282" n="247" xml:id="pg_247"/> in the country and called
                            for revising the constitution. Firm planning to phase out <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> now could be seen as
                            bringing added pressure against the Soviet use of facilities at Aden and
                            at Umm Qasr in Iraq. In any event, the littoral states in the Gulf have
                            increasingly taken on responsibility for regional security, and any
                            efforts to maintain our own naval presence are likely to be viewed
                            increasingly as anachronistic.</p>
                        <p>The question now before us is, do we try to get the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> to withdraw its letter because of the
                            importance of our interests in the Gulf and Indian Ocean and the need to
                            avoid potentially adverse repercussions in other countries, or do we
                            accede to Bahrain’s decision. If we accede, do we accept the Foreign
                            Minister’s suggestion to devise a joint statement indicating our mutual
                            understanding regarding the withdrawal of <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Options</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">We go back to the Bahrainis by making a high-level
                                appeal from the President to the Ruler</hi> which would reassure
                            them that we have never intended <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss>’s presence to be a permanent one but ask that
                            the August 12 letter be withdrawn. This approach would be coordinated
                            with similar appeals to the Shah and King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName> seeking their support for a continued, open-ended

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advantages</p>
                        <p>—A high-level appeal would indicate to the Bahrainis that we felt
                            strongly about the importance of maintaining <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> and, by implication,
                            that damage could take place to our bilateral relations if Bahrain is
                            seen to have forced us out.</p>
                        <p>—It would require the Shah and the Saudis to weigh this request in light
                            of our strong bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disadvantages</p>
                        <p>—Even if high-level pressure succeeded, it could substantially weaken
                            Bahrain’s present moderate leadership in the face of domestic
                            left/nationalist opposition which would be contrary to US interests in
                            Gulf stability.</p>
                        <p>—We would be drawing heavily on our credit with Iran and Saudi Arabia to
                            save a facility of limited strategic utility or importance. Our earlier,
                            lower-level attempts have not been successful, and neither the Shah
                            nor—with less certainty—the Saudis are likely to back away from previous
                            statements favoring eventual removal of foreign forces from the Gulf
                            region.</p>

                            the world in a region where we have substantial interests.</p>
                        <p>—Congress could balk at the $4 million rent knowing full well the Force

                        <p>—This approach would also enable increased pressure by other Arabs on

                            their view, it would be misleading and untimely to go on record with a

                                >GOB</gloss> statement implying that a mutual agreement for the

                            June 30, 1977 had been reached for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>(a) The Bahraini note to withdraw notwithstanding, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has not reached a decision that it is

                        <p>(b) Until the current Bahraini political situation is resolved, the US
                            should maintain maximum flexible options.</p>
                        <p>(c) The fluid situation in the Middle East will continue to affect

                            views.</p>
                        <p>(d) No approach to the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> has yet been
                            made to obtain their views on the possibility of retaining the <gloss

                            1973, provide the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> with a

                            the feasibility of discontinuation of homeporting the flagship at
                            Bahrain but retaining <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>

                            to terminate the <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>
                            presence on Bahrain is unlikely to change and that it is in the
                            interests of the United States to accept this decision as gracefully as
                            possible while maintaining maximum flexibility for subsequent
                            negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> and for the
                            formulation of US policy options. This objective could be achieved by
                            the choice of either Option 3 or 4, each of which provides the
                            opportunity of spelling out the US position. If Option 4 is chosen, the
                            present draft should indicate that the initiative for a reassessment of
                            the <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> presence
                            originated with the Government of Bahrain. This is a fact which will

                            options for trying to keep <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> and that the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> will insist on the June 1977 termination date. It
                            believes the best way to cut our losses is to accept the Bahraini
                            decision gracefully and to work out a statement reached jointly by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. This could avoid at least a public
                            indication that the US had had to accede to a unilateral decision by
                            Bahrain to force the Navy off the island. We would also get some credit
                            for adopting a flexible and accommodating position on this issue. This
                            approach would still give us a small option to reopen the matter during
                            the next eighteen months, should future circumstances allow.</p>

                        <p>1. That the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> approve Option 4 to

                            bilateral relations, agreement was reached on what public position the
                            US would take in response to press queries that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> had asked the US Navy to leave its
                            facilities in Bahrain in June 1977. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> reviewed potential problems we saw in obtaining
                            Congressional approval for the much higher rent for the Navy’s use of
                            the facilities and for our request to establish a technical assistance
                            program in Bahrain in view of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss>’s short tenure. In response to the Foreign
                            Minister’s questions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> reviewed US intentions regarding the use of
                            Masirah Island, the significance of the Sinai agreement for the
                            peacemaking process in the Middle East, and Israel’s request to the US
                            to buy Pershing missiles. The meeting ended with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> asking for <gloss

                        <p>Shaikh Muhammad said he first wanted to discuss US-Bahraini bilateral
                            relations. He thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1"
                                >Twinam</persName>’s help in completing the series of understandings
                            on <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>, which we believed
                            would be in the best interests of both countries. Bahrain’s relations
                            with the US were older than with any other country except for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> wanted to maintain its good relations with the US and
                            have American presence in Bahrain on the same basis as it is in
                            neighboring Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iran. He realized the problems
                            which the announcement ending <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> in mid-1977 <pb facs="0287" n="252"
                                xml:id="pg_252"/> posed for the Navy and he hoped that some new
                            arrangement could be worked out that would suit both countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said bilateral
                            relations were very good and the whole <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> negotiations had been carried out in an
                            excellent atmosphere. However, we saw two problems, each had a different
                            order of magnitude. The first was our official response to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s August 12 note setting a June 1977
                            deadline for <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>. The
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was still trying to sort out
                            its position and we hoped there would be a reply soon. We saw several
                            choices: formally acknowledging the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                            >GOB</gloss>’s note, issuing a joint statement announcing the decision
                            to leave, or issuing an oral statement unilaterally. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said he would welcome having
                            the Foreign Minister’s views, and what the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> might most hope for.</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Muhammad said that a low key joint announcement would be best. He
                            thought that a continued US presence in the Gulf was very important but
                            he did not want Bahrain to be singled out. Periodic visits by the Navy
                            to Bahrain would be fine and the US and Bahrain should give some thought
                            to this. After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>
                            pointed out that there is the practical problem that the fleet must have
                            a home port, Shaikh Muhammad suggested that thought should be given to
                            another arrangement (but offered no suggestion).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said the other
                            problem we had, and it was more immediate, was how we respond to the <hi
                                rend="italic">Al Anwar</hi> article that the Bahrainis had asked us
                            to withdraw <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>. We had
                            put off answering questions since the article had appeared last Thursday
                            to have this opportunity to consult on a reply. Here too we had several
                            choices. We could state that the agreement provides for termination and
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> had told us that we should
                            look to removing <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> by
                            mid-1977. Or we could be less forthcoming and say simply that we are in
                            consultation with the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> about the
                            future presence of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>.
                            The US would be prepared to be specific if the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> wished.</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Muhammad said he would prefer not to be too specific. After some
                            discussion, it was agreed that we could respond to a question from the
                            press by stating that: “The 1971 Stationing Agreement provides that
                            either party may terminate the agreement. The Bahrain Government has
                            told the United States that it would like to phase out the US Navy’s
                            Middle East Force during 1977. The United States Government is in
                            consultation with the Bahrain Government on this matter in the spirit of
                            the close and friendly relations which have existed between the two
                            countries over many years.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said there was one
                            other matter he wanted to raise which affected <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>. This was Congress’
                            attitude toward the rent and our request for a topping off technical
                            assistance program. <pb facs="0288" n="253" xml:id="pg_253"/> The
                            Administration intended to go through with both commitments. For the
                            rent, it was explaining that a higher figure was justified in view of
                            the higher real estate values of the land now occupied by <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> and for the use of the
                            commercial pier and other facilities. But taken in conjunction with the
                            short period of time that <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> would remain, Congress might well react
                            negatively and ask if we are getting out, why should we pay this very
                            high rent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> added
                            the Administration would take the position that this is a reasonable
                            arrangement without regard to the number of years that the Navy might
                            remain and try to keep the two questions from being connected. We had
                            also taken the position of not linking our request for technical
                            assistance with continued <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> presence but there was considerable risk that
                            Congress would make the link and refuse to approve our technical
                            assistance program for Bahrain.</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Muhammad said he could understand Congress’ reaction about the
                            rent but it would be a great mistake if Congress should use this excuse
                            to stop technical assistance. The latter was more effective than
                            anything else. This is what the man in the street understands. There
                            were many areas where US technical assistance was needed—water supply,
                            agriculture, housing—and Bahrain was sorry that the US had not done more
                            in this field. In response, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> reviewed the recent activities of the Joint
                            Commission in Saudi Arabia and reimbursable technical assistance
                            programs in other Peninsula states.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Bilateral Issues</p>
                        <p>Asked if there were any other bilateral issues he wanted to raise, Shaikh
                            Muhammad said only one—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> had promised to visit Bahrain and he must keep
                            that promise.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then asked what US intentions were toward Masirah.
                            In reply, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said that
                            the US never had any intention of a build-up on the island. We had asked
                            Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName> when he was in
                            Washington if we could work out with the <gloss target="#t_UK_2"
                                >UK</gloss> an arrangement for the occasional use of Masirah when we
                            had naval exercises in the Indian Ocean and if aircraft connected with
                            the fleet visit could use Masirah on an emergency basis or for practice
                            exercises. We were not interested in basing any personnel, equipment or
                            aircraft at Masirah.</p>

                                >TOW</gloss> Missiles. Ref: Abu Dhabi 2007. For Ambassador from
                            Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. You have made a strong case for the sale of <gloss target="#t_TOW_1"
                                >TOWs</gloss> to Abu Dhabi Defense Force but after a good deal of
                            reflection, we have come to conclusion that there are good and
                            compelling reasons to disapprove both release of <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOWs</gloss> and sending an expert to Abu Dhabi to
                            discuss issue at this time:</p>
                        <p>(A) Basic reason for this decision is that <gloss target="#t_TOW_1"
                                >TOW</gloss> system bears no plausible relationship to any threat
                            which Abu Dhabi, or <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> for that
                            matter, might conceivably face. Only armor within feasible striking
                            range of Abu Dhabi to our knowledge is small number of armored cars in
                            Dubai Defense Force and Union Defense Force and that is hardly the kind
                            of threat we want to build up <gloss target="#t_ADDF_1">ADDF</gloss> to
                            defend itself against.</p>
                        <p>(B) Our various national security studies on arms sales in lower Gulf
                            states, carried out in early seventies and related to withdrawal of
                            protective British presence, produced conclusion that we should sell
                            equipment which enhanced internal security capability of small states
                            but which would not whet appetites of other lower Gulf states (or in
                            case of <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> appetites of armed forces
                            of other Emirates), and which could be destabilizing. We think this
                            policy has stood the test of time well. We have made only one sale which
                            might be construed as an exception to that policy: we agreed to sale of
                            a small number of <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOWs</gloss> to Oman because
                            it is engaged in a war against an enemy supported by <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> could conceivably, if Dhofar rebels were pressed to
                            point of near extinction, throw Soviet supplied armor into direct action
                            against Oman.</p>
                        <p>(C) We have had ample opportunity in recent weeks to sample the
                            congressional mood on arms sales in region. It is not receptive. Each
                            case of significance has had, or will have, to be argued in detail on
                            its merits. To argue that sale of <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOWs</gloss>
                            will gain us significant political <pb facs="0290" n="255"
                                xml:id="pg_255"/> advantages in <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>
                            is simply not persuasive on the Hill. Arguments having to do with
                            previous sales of weapons to other nations in the area are probably
                            equally non-persuasive; they may well be interpreted by some in Congress
                            as evidence of past irresponsibility in arms sales rather than as a
                            rationale for future actions.</p>
                        <p>2. In reaching this conclusion, we have taken into account the larger
                            political framework in which you have placed this request and we are of
                            course pleased that <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Shaikh
                                Zayid</persName> has made this gesture toward us. Consistent with
                            what you were told here, we have also taken into account that given the
                            pattern of US arms sales in region, we cannot over the long-term hope to
                            pursue our interests successfully in Abu Dhabi without being responsive
                            in some realistic measure to requests for US arms. But it seems to us
                            that our political relations can only be strengthened by our responding
                            to this request with utmost forthrightness and pointing out to <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> that he has simply picked the
                            wrong symbol for his gesture. While our disapproval of this sale may
                            make it more difficult for us to develop a relationship in this
                            sensitive area with Abu Dhabi, our concurrence, followed by
                            congressional action against it, would do far more to damage US–<gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> bilateral relations and it could hurt
                            our credibility with Congress in cases which we believe to be
                            justifiable.</p>
                        <p>3. In presenting our decision to <gloss target="#t_ADG_1">ADG</gloss>,
                            you should make a maximum effort to separate our general policy from the
                            outcome of this particular case. We do wish to be helpful to Abu Dhabi
                            in meeting its legitimate defense needs, but an honest relationship is
                            essential in this field as in others. It would not help Abu Dhabi for us
                            to go along with a request for a weapon such as <gloss target="#t_TOW_1"
                                >TOW</gloss>, which is unrelated to their real needs and on which
                            they are admittedly not well-informed themselves; on the contrary, it
                            would, in the long run, have a destructive effect as it became clear to
                                <gloss target="#t_ADDF_1">ADDF</gloss> just how useless <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> would be in their environment. Part of
                            the reason for the success of our military supply and training programs
                            in Saudi Arabia, for example, is that we have tried to tell the Saudis
                            the truth about what we thought they needed, and what was superfluous or
                            unworkable. The result has been that although the Saudis do not always
                            like what they hear, they keep coming back for more because our approach
                            has fostered a relationship of frankness and honesty, and the Saudis
                            respect that. It is ultimately only on that basis that we can foster a
                            cooperative relationship in the military field, and I hope that whatever
                            Abu Dhabi Government officials you discuss this with can be persuaded of
                            the validity of that approach.</p>

                        <p>1. SUMMARY: Because of its vulnerability to Arab bloc and other
                            pressures, Qataris cannot be expected to snap to when US barks in
                            multilateral fora. There is some hope of improving Qatari performance if
                            we pay more attention to their representatives abroad at earlier stages
                            of development of our positions. Threats of curtailment of relations to
                            enforce conformity are not credible, and stand to lose us more than we
                            would gain. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. From perspective of Qatar too, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SME_1"
                                >Sterner</persName>’s observations, comments and suggestions on US
                            multilateral diplomacy applied to Arab bloc are generally relevant.</p>
                        <p>3. On most multilateral questions, <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>
                            not only shelters under umbrella of Arab bloc but, despite its
                            conservatism and anti-Communism, cowers within it in fear of Algerians
                            and other Arab radicals. Saudi inertia and death of father figure
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> substantially
                            diminish Saudi influence on Qataris in international fora. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> is perhaps more influenced by
                            consistent Egyptian adherence to anti-<gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> positions, in part because most of Foreign Ministry’s
                            senior substantive advisors are seconded Egyptian diplomats.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>’s disposition to line up against
                            us on international issues, or at best to take a negative abstention
                            stance, is further conditioned by its status as nonaligned, Third World,
                            and <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> nation. In all these
                            contexts, at least at present, confrontative aspects of relationship
                            with US outweigh cooperative ones. Although <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1"
                                >GOQ</gloss> does not as yet have capacity to think through clearly
                            most international questions, its usually fuzzy-headed conclusions,
                            influenced by factors aforementioned, often put it on wrong side of
                            argument as far as <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>5. There is a positive element, suggested by Qataris themselves, that may
                            hold some promise of better <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>
                            cooperation with us in <pb facs="0292" n="257" xml:id="pg_257"/>
                            international fora. After Qataris’ backsliding performance from positive
                            to abstention position on Friendly Korean Resolution at 30th <gloss

                                >GOQ</gloss> Foreign Minister told me that fuller consultation with
                            Qatari reps in Washington and New York early in game as <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> positions being developed would help
                            improve support of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> views. He
                            strongly criticized what he described as our “last minute fireman”
                            efforts in capital to secure <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>
                            support. Closer consultations at earlier stages is worth pursuing,
                            although we have no illusions about how much difference it will make in
                                <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>’s performance.</p>
                        <p>6. Finally, I too would caution against loose use of threats in effort to
                            compel conformity to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> positions. I
                            agree fully with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SME_1"
                                >Sterner</persName> that these threats would soon be exposed as not
                            credible, since <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has more to lose
                            than gain by curtailing relationships with Qatar and other small states
                            in this area.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: We do not think that the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            can be induced to make a public declaration of support for the retention
                            of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>. In recent months
                            Saudi officials have moved from a position of private support and public
                            silence on a US naval presence in the Gulf to a more consistent private
                            and public advocacy of the removal of all non-littoral forces from the
                            Gulf. An approach at the presidential level might stand some chance of
                            success if we were prepared to argue that very major US interests are
                            involved, but this would require a decision <pb facs="0293" n="258"
                                xml:id="pg_258"/> that retention of the Force merits the expenditure
                            of such a sizeable chunk of US political capital. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. We do not believe that the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> can be
                            persuaded to issue a public statement of support for the retention of
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> in Bahrain, in
                            spite of the fact that there are some advantages to the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> in the presence of such a US force in
                            the Gulf. The most obvious advantage is the on-the-job training provided
                            to Saudi sailors mentioned ref A, but this is vitiated by the Saudi
                            understanding that the US is obligated to provide the same kind of
                            training in connection with the Saudi Naval Expansion Program. The force
                            probably also has some attractiveness as the representative of the only
                            friendly naval power capable of keeping the Shah from turning the Gulf
                            into a Persian lake at Saudi expense.</p>
                        <p>2. However, there are more compelling reasons why the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> will be prepared to see the force go
                            and, in fact, the private views of Saudi officials have in recent months
                            swung into line with their public position that all foreign naval forces
                            should depart the Gulf. This was most recently enunciated by Foreign
                            Minister Prince Saud on January 3 during a call by the Charge and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PR_1">Paganelli</persName> who was
                            visiting from Qatar (ref c). Perhaps the most important of the reasons
                            why the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> will be reluctant publicly
                            to support retention is that the Saudi leadership would regard doing so
                            as inconsistent with Saudi Arabia’s new role as a leader of the Arab
                            world maintaining close and friendly relations with the US but no longer
                            hiding behind US skirts. An appearance of Saudi independence from the US
                            is important to this role.</p>
                        <p>3. Additionally, in terms of the politics of the Gulf, the Shah’s
                            unequivocal public position on the removal of foreign naval forces has
                            further tied the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s hands. The
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> is extremely sensitive to
                            statements emanating from Tehran that Iran has a special responsibility
                            for Gulf security. In response, Saudi leaders have frequently stated
                            that there is no power vacuum on the Arab side of the Gulf which must be
                            filled by a power from elsewhere in the Gulf or external to it. In this
                            light, publicly to advocate retention of the force could be interpreted
                            as an admission that Saudi Arabia is not confident of its ability to
                            look after the security of its coasts and waters. It could invite an
                            Iranian riposte that the Iranian navy is capable of looking after the
                            interests of other Gulf states until they are prepared to do it for
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>4. Finally, the Saudis no longer regard <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> as quite the benign presence they once
                            considered it to be. The Saudis were disturbed by public statements by
                            US officials early last year on the subject of seizing the oil fields in
                            certain circumstances and quite badly shaken by the subsequent flood of
                            articles detailing how and why this should be done. For a time they
                            believed that there was an orchestrated series <pb facs="0294" n="259"
                                xml:id="pg_259"/> of threats. “Routine” operations by a US carrier
                            task group in the Persian Gulf last spring seemed to give substance to
                            these threats. Saudi fears and suspicions have since been dissipated,
                            but the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> can probably never again
                            look at <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> in the same
                            way.</p>
                        <p>5. For the foregoing reasons we do not believe that an approach by the
                            Ambassador to even the highest levels of the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> would result in a public Saudi statement of support for
                            the retention of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>. The
                            most we could reasonably hope for would be private Saudi assurances to
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> that the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> is not concerned about the continued
                            presence of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> in
                            Bahrain and would have no objection if the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> were to allow the scheduled date for departure to
                            slip.</p>
                        <p>6. It is possible that we might get a more positive response if the
                            President were to take the matter up directly or by letter with King
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>. To do so in the
                            light of our extensive interests in Saudi Arabia would be to portray
                            retention of the force as a major US interest in the region. Before
                            taking such a step we must decide that retention of the force merits the
                            considerable drawing down of political capital which would be involved.
                            From the Jidda perspective it is not immediately apparent that such a
                            step is merited.</p>

                        <p>The four-year-old United Arab Emirates (<gloss target="#t_UAE_1"
                                >UAE</gloss>) is a confederation of seven small city-states that are
                            autonomous in such important areas as the use of oil revenues, defense,
                            and internal security. The rulers of the sheikhdoms still regard each
                            other with a good deal of suspicion and jealously guard their
                            prerogatives against the encroachment of <pb facs="0295" n="260"
                                xml:id="pg_260"/> the central government. Economic and social forces
                            are, nevertheless, slowly knitting the sheikhdoms together.</p>
                        <p>Much of the credit for the development of the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1"
                                >UAE</gloss> belongs to its president <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"
                                >Sheikh Zayid</persName>, who is also the ruler of Abu Dhabi, the
                            largest and by far the wealthiest of the sheikhdoms. Using a deft
                            combination of consensus politics and timely handouts, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> has managed to maintain
                            generally good relations with his squabbling fellow rulers. He has
                            cautiously steered a middle course in both domestic and foreign affairs,
                            thus reducing factionalism and eliminating issues his opponents might
                            exploit. He has seen to it that certain traditional bedouin and Islamic
                            features remain prominent, in order to reduce the impact of foreign
                            workers inundating the country.</p>
                        <p>Though he tries to rule largely by consensus, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Sheikh Zayid</persName> has taken care to make
                            the Abu Dhabi Defense Force—responsible to him personally, not in his
                            capacity as president of the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>—the
                            largest and best equipped military force. <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"
                                >Zayid</persName> has promoted the unification of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> and local military and security
                            forces, but his fellow rulers have thus far been able to stave off this
                            development.</p>
                        <p>The tension between central and local interests is likely to remain a
                            permanent problem for the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> himself would have
                            trouble holding to the larger view if he were not president of the
                            union, and it is not surprising that <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"
                                >Zayid</persName>’s major obstacle in establishing an effective
                            central government is Sheikh Rashid, the ruler of Dubai, the second most
                            important sheikhdom. Although Sheikh Rashid is the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>’s vice-president, he sees no reason to
                            contribute to the strengthening of the central government to <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName>’s benefit, and at his own
                            expense.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (8 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> in its first four years has
                            sought to obtain recognition as a united entity, while avoiding any
                            foreign antagonisms that could impair the knitting together of the
                            sheikhdoms—a problem compounded somewhat by the existence of large
                            foreign communities, including Palestinian, in the sheikhdoms, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>’s dependence on foreigners for
                            many critical functions.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> seems to be
                            personally inclined to inject the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>
                            into Arab and international affairs, even if he has to use a major
                            portion of Abu Dhabi’s resources to do it, he is somewhat constrained by
                            the other rulers who believe that his money, if not his time, would be
                            better spent at home. He must also tread carefully so as not to step on
                            the toes of Riyadh or Tehran, who expect him to follow their lead. The
                            result has been a cautious, pragmatic, middle-of-the-road policy.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> keeps his Arab
                            credentials in good order, tries to avoid taking a position on
                            intra-Arab differences, and is aloof on most east-west issues—but he is
                            maintaining a society that is western-oriented <pb facs="0296" n="261"
                                xml:id="pg_261"/> and capitalistic. He has not, so far, permitted
                            communist states to establish a presence in the <gloss target="#t_UAE_1"
                                >UAE</gloss>, although some of his advisers have been pushing for
                            relations with the Soviet Union and <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1"
                                >Zayid</persName> may be giving some thought to this.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> has consistently supported the
                            traditional conservative regimes of the Arabian Peninsula. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> has given assistance to both
                            Oman and North Yemen, mostly economic but including some discreet
                            military assistance as well, largely to strengthen them against South
                            Yemeni subversion. He worked hard to reach an agreement with Saudi
                            Arabia on a border dispute that had poisoned relations between the two
                            countries for years. He accepts Iran’s role in the area as a fact of
                            life and is not too concerned by the Shah’s claim to have primary
                            responsibility for security in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Much of <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName>’s foreign policy
                            consists of lavish handouts, first to the Arab confrontation states,
                            then to other Arab states needing assistance, and finally to other
                            Islamic states. In 1974 alone, he gave away nearly a quarter of Abu
                            Dhabi’s income. Last year’s drop in oil production, however, combined
                            with increasing complaints from the other rulers, has forced <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> to curb his commitments.</p>
                        <p>US–<gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> relations are basically good. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> values US technological
                            strength; Americans are personally popular there. But <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> is sensitive to the ups and
                            downs of the Arab-Israeli situation; Abu Dhabi was the first Arab state
                            to announce an embargo against the US during the October 1973 war.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZISAS_1">Zayid</persName> has since probably
                            come to a greater appreciation of the complexity of the problem and US
                            negotiating efforts. He knows that renewed war would disrupt the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>’s ties with the west and possibly
                            extend radical interests in the Gulf. He nevertheless is also subjected
                            to the arguments of those who oppose a negotiated settlement and would
                            like to see US efforts fail.</p>
                        <p>Oil policy is an additional area of difference. Following the quadrupling
                            of oil prices, the speculation in the US media about the possibility of
                            US action against Gulf oil fields caused feeling against the US to run
                            fairly high. With the world-wide economic slump since, however, the
                                <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> seems to have come to a better
                            realization that oil decisions cannot be taken in isolation of world
                            economic conditions.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of the outcome of Middle East peace negotiations, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> will be careful to balance US
                            interests there with those of other friendly industrial powers—the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>, France, eventually perhaps
                            Japan. Should the Arab-Israeli situation deteriorate sharply, of course,
                            US commercial interests would suffer.</p>

                            of ways we would be able assist <gloss target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss>.

                                corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> mentioned in particular program
                            of reimbursable technical assistance which he described as heart of
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> effort in Saudi Arabia. He
                            noted presence of Kendrick on delegation and fact he (Kendrick) would
                            remain behind to pursue further this extremely important area.</p>
                        <p>3. Overview—<persName corresp="#p_PG_1">Parsky</persName> noted that we
                            pursuring two avenues toward greater economic cooperation in Middle
                            East. (A) In some cases we have established formal procedures such as
                            Joint Commission in Saudi Arabia. Under this mechanism we sought to
                            achieve two things: First, to provide technical expertise in various
                            areas, both from government sources and private sector—all, of course,
                            reimbursable; and, second, to facilitate <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> private sector involvement in host country development
                            program. (B) Alternative was less formal approach. This might involve
                            some loose structure such as he, <persName corresp="#p_PG_1"
                                >Parsky</persName>, had outlined in recent letter to <gloss
                                target="#t_MinPet_1">MinPet</gloss> Otaiba (Abu Dhabi 461 and
                            previous). Under such a formula Embassy in Abu Dhabi would be major
                            channel while “we in Washington” would mobilize various agency efforts,
                            State, Commerce, ExIm, Treasury et al. Point was <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> ready cooperate. We assume <gloss
                                target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> might prefer less formal setup but
                            we prepared discuss. Shaikh Hamdan responded noting that <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> welcomed increased cooperation and
                            that in <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>, having as it does free
                            capitalist system, both private and government involvement welcomed. In
                            area of technical expertise, <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>
                            recognized that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was leader and help
                            needed in number of areas.</p>
                        <p>4. Investment policy—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1"
                                >Simon</persName> reiterated <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            belief in strong free market system. We welcomed investment and believed
                            fear of <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> takeovers largely
                            dissipated. In fact we need outside capital for our own development.
                            Secretary asked for statement of <gloss target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss>
                            policy in this area and what we might do to assist. Habroush responded
                            that <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> already had most of its
                            investments in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, some 63 percent,
                            reflecting fact <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> (a) had biggest
                            market, (b) had free economic system and (c) offered best opportunities.
                                <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> not seeking involvement in
                            sensitive areas or controlling interest, just good return. In subsequent
                            give-and-take Habroush said most funds invested in <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> were in equity holdings; that while
                            revenues will be around $4.5 billion in 1976 there would be relatively
                            little for foreign investment—most would be spent internally or given
                            away abroad; that <gloss target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> had not yet
                            reached degree of sophistication where it concentrated its investments
                            in particular sectors or on industries exporting to this area. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PG_1">Parsky</persName> mentioned <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy of being prepared consult in
                            advance about possible major investments. Habroush, as mentioned ref A,
                            reiterated commitment to use this offer at such time such investments
                            might be contemplated.</p>
                        <p>5. Technical assistance—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1"
                                >Simon</persName> asked Kendrick to give status of our program in
                            reimbursable technical assistance. Kendrick noted we had had this
                            capability for some time, but only in 1975 had <pb facs="0299" n="264"
                                xml:id="pg_264"/> Congress made funds available to permit US promote
                            it. Kendrick said we can draw on resources of both some 100 government
                            agencies as well as total private sector. In time he hoped to have
                            representative in Gulf but in meantime Embassy would serve as channel to
                            get requests for assistance into Washington. Kendrick specifically
                            mentioned arrival of Berger team following day which with <gloss
                                target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> permission would seek explore this
                            area further. [garble–Pachachi], echoing welcome expressed by others on
                                <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> side for exploration of this
                            field, noted there already considerable cooperation with <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> private sector in technical
                            fields—e.g. ADNOC. Both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1"
                                >Simon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PG_1">Parsky</persName>
                            welcomed this and expressed wish to encourage more of same. At same time
                            they noted there were areas where <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Government might have best expertise or could help identify best sources
                            of assistance.</p>
                        <p>6. Parallel financing—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1"
                                >Simon</persName>, noting interest both countries had in helping
                            ease burden of developing countries, said he knew <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> target of many requests and that
                                <gloss target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> might well have difficulty in
                            some cases in making evaluations. With our 30 years experience we in
                            position to help. Secretary also noted we would like to cooperate with
                                <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> to discuss joint ventures on
                            case-by-case basis, something which we felt could be mutually
                            beneficial. Hassan Abbas Zaki described ADFAED activities noting
                            existing commitments of $250 million to be disbursed over next four
                            years. He expected additional $50 million in commitment this year with
                            actual disbursement in 1976 perhaps totalling $80 million. Re
                            cooperation, Zaki mentioned existing joint efforts with World Bank and
                            bilaterally with some other countries. Said Fund welcomed cooperation
                            with <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> on case-by-case basis, with
                            both sides feeling free to raise possibilities to other. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_PG_1">Parsky</persName> suggested earmarking specific
                            sum (he cited figure of $100 million) to give concrete evidence of
                            efforts to aid developing nations, Zaki replied this would be difficult.
                            If done in one instance, others would request similar commitment and
                            Fund would find its options limited. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> then said specific amount not
                            critical; there was no reason to tie hands, intention to cooperate was
                            the key. In response to Ambassador’s query, Zaki noted that Fund no
                            longer limiting itself to Arab world, but focus did remain largely
                            Africa and Asia (Habroush wryly noted “Latin America is yours”). Zaki
                            stated they did not wish spread selves too thin.</p>
                        <p>7. Turning to assistance offered outside scope of ADFAED, Habroush cited
                            government’s impressive record. As percentage of revenues <gloss
                                target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> aid totaled 19 percent in 74, 27
                            percent in 75, and was anticipated to be 23 percent in 76 (Habroush
                            noted latter figure might be higher, with $150 million donated during
                            recent [garble] of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            presumably being one of points he had in mind). If calculated on basis
                            of actual expenditures, Habroush said figures were 41 percent in 74 <pb
                                facs="0300" n="265" xml:id="pg_265"/> and 37 percent in 75—and much
                            of this was in straight grants. Both Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PG_1"
                                >Parsky</persName> noted how impressive these figures were and said
                            story should be publicized. It would very much help <gloss
                                target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss>’s public image in oil consumer
                            countries. Pachachi noted effort had been made to tell story but “we
                            have small voice.” On final point, Habroush responded to Ambassador’s
                            question by stating that <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> would like
                            to give greater emphasis to aid through multilateral channels, but he
                            was rather vague as to when and how this might occur.</p>
                        <p>8. Trade—<persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName>, noting <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> interest in promoting trade and our
                            desire to set a target figure, asked Commerce <gloss target="#t_Asst_1"
                                >Asst</gloss> Secty Reed to address this issue. Reed cited figures
                            reflecting major expansion of bilateral trade in both directions over
                            past few years. He stated <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> wished to
                            remain major trading partner and to increase its position if possible.
                            Noting 1975 level of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> exports at
                            $370 million he said he would like to see target set for 1976 of $500
                            million. He thought this realistic and we would encourage <gloss
                                target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> to establish similar target figure
                            for its exports to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Reed then
                            described Commerce’s efforts both in <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> (field office programs) and here (upcoming trade
                            missions) to further this effort. Hamdan responded noting that success
                            of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> exports depends on
                            competitiveness, delivery dates, and suitability. <gloss
                                target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> with free enterprise system could
                            not set trade target, but it certainly expected trade to expand—<gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> exports should rise to over 20 percent
                            of <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> total imports. Delivery dates
                            and maintenance were keys, Hamdan noted—and he said <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> doing well in these areas at same time
                            Europeans slipping. Reed mentioned our concern that when <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> bids come in high <gloss
                                target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> not think <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> firms being frivolous—our firms making best efforts
                            and sometimes do not understand how others can offer prices as low as
                            they do. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> went on
                            to note that while we must obviously be competitive, we have heard cases
                            where others will deliberately bid low with idea of subsequent
                            adjustment. He urged <gloss target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> to keep eye
                            out for such practices.</p>
                        <p>9. Joint statement—<persName corresp="#p_PG_1">Parsky</persName>, noting
                            that we hoped to be able to issue joint statement reflecting results of
                            Secretary’s visit, said <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> side would
                            of course be willing to add or expand in existing draft on any points
                            discussed during group meeting. He noted specifically that <gloss
                                target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> side might wish consider some
                            reference to ongoing relationship—e.g. some form of committee of more
                            informal nature. This would demonstrate “special relationship” existing
                            between two countries. <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> side
                            expressed some interest in this and suggested further discussion after
                            lunch. There was also brief interchange between <persName
                                corresp="#p_PG_1">Parsky</persName> and Zaki re some form of
                            specific arrangement for reviewing possible third country investment
                            projects (e.g. such as list of projects under consideration which World
                            Bank sends to <gloss target="#t_UAEG_1">UAEG</gloss> on regular basis
                            for review). (Note: Neither of these points made final communiqué, but

                            definite interest in them and they are worthy of further exploration
                            under conditions where pressure for early decision and public commitment
                            does not exist.)</p>

                            Manama 741.</p>
                        <p>Summary: June 15 Prime Minister made to me “official government request”
                            that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> consider supplying military
                            assistance to Bahrain on concessionary terms to enable Al Khalifa regime
                            to justify “extending the agreement” under which Middle East Force
                            enjoys facilities. Prime Minister and Crown Prince/Defense Minister
                            clearly want concessionary arrangement “like Jordan and Turkey, not like
                            Saudi Arabia and Kuwait”. In promising to forward request to <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, I stressed I was without instructions
                            and hence unable to predict substance or timing of <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> response. I explained at some length,
                            however, on “personal basis” why this request seems to call for a new
                            departure in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Gulf policy requiring
                            the most careful top-level consideration in the executive and possibly
                            legislative authorization. Therefore on basis its own recent experience
                            with proposed technical assistance program <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> should not necessarily anticipate a quick <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> response. Meanwhile June 1977 deadline
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> has placed on <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy’s departure <pb facs="0302"
                                n="267" xml:id="pg_267"/> is drawing nigh and Middle East Force will
                            soon need to start taking some practical steps to meet it. Should not
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> as first step, and without
                            additional commitment by either government, unilaterally extend the
                            deadline? Prime Minister ducked this suggestion, asked for official
                            response to his request, and reiterated he would be willing to come to
                            Washington to discuss this question personally with top <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> officials, if he could be assured a
                            definitive response there. Our own policy problems aside, this request,
                            serious though it may be, seems flawed even from Bahraini perspective.
                            End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. June 15 I spent an hour with Prime Minister Shaikh Khalifa bin Sulman
                            discussing his desire, first raised June 13 with Commander Middle East
                            Force Admiral Bigley and reported in Navy channels, to develop a
                            military assistance relationship with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> to enable ruling Al Khalifa family to justify
                            retaining Middle East Force in Bahrain. Subsequently I spent an hour
                            with his nephew Crown Prince/Defense Minister Shaikh Hamad bin Isa
                            re-emphasizing points I had made to Prime Minister and trying to pin
                            down more definitively what price these two senior members of government
                            are asking this time. With apologies, I am persuaded this must be
                            reported in some detail.</p>
                        <p>2. Prime Minister uncharacteristically raced through pleasantries to get
                            right down to business, first ploughing the old ground of long-standing
                            Bahraini friendship for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and his
                            unhappiness with the two decisions Cabinet has made to ask the Navy out.
                            In October 1973 Cabinet in his absence had been swayed by Arab-Israel
                            emotions. Last summer government had been under pressure re the Navy
                            from Gulf neighbors and National Assembly at home. Now he is “in
                            stronger position”: gone is the National Assembly, the people no longer
                            want to “get mixed up in politics”, and he is hence free to serve the
                            best interests of his people. He has “personal assurances” from Iran,
                            Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that they would not object if Bahrain let the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy keep using “facilities
                            which have no aspects of being a base”. He understands the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy would like to stay in Bahrain and
                            he has been thinking of ways to make it possible. (Shaikh Hamad later
                            was eloquent in lamenting the great cost and human hardship of removing
                            the Navy’s wives and children from this garden of Eden to some “desolate
                            island” (Diego Garcia?) thousands of miles from nowhere.)</p>
                        <p>3. Prime Minister continued he had understood “<gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> is seeking” some sort of Saudi/Iranian approval for
                            continued Middle East Force presence and wanted me to know that both the
                            Shah and Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> had
                            assured him Bahrain is “free to make its own decision” re Middle East
                            Force. I corrected him, noting in first place <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> would not be surprised to learn of such private
                            assurances from Tehran and Riyadh since Middle East Force is in the Gulf
                            because we believed in 1970 that it would continue to serve mutual
                            interests of us and all Gulf states <pb facs="0303" n="268"
                                xml:id="pg_268"/> in contributing to region’s security. We were not
                            seeking Saudi/Iranian approval; rather <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> had told us Middle East Force is a domestic political
                            liability which it could no longer bear in absence of public, not
                            private, Saudi/Iranian statements of support for Bahrain’s retaining it.
                            (Shaikh Hamad later described Middle East Force as a political liability
                            which is bearable only with significant evidence of benefits, like
                            military assistance, which accrue to Bahrain by virtue of the US Navy’s
                            presence;)</p>
                        <p>4. This provoked somewhat heated response from the Prime Minister that
                            he, “not the Shah and King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName>”, determines Bahrain’s policy and if he decides
                            the Navy should stay he does not need Saudi and Iranian approval.
                            Bahrain has best of relations with “all Gulf states, even Qatar though
                            they are sometimes unreasonable”, but Bahrain is “independent”. Yes,
                            Saudis, Kuwaitis and <gloss target="#t_UAE_1">UAE</gloss> are being
                            helpful to Bahrain’s economic development and public welfare schemes but
                            Bahrain cannot let its neighbors make its policy and cannot become
                            dependent on them for arms. (Comment: This is most impassioned display I
                            have witnessed of the deep aversion of the proud and “aristocratic” Al
                            Khalifa to increased subservience to richer and more powerful neighbors,
                            and their consequent unrealistic longing for the return of the “special
                            relationship” with Anglo/America. See Manama 181, “Bahrain awash in the
                            Gulf” and previous reporting. We could exploit this tendency for limited
                            bilateral gains but to do so would work against our broader objective of
                            fostering regional cooperation in security matters.)</p>
                        <p>5. Prime Minister continued that “he and Shaikh Hamad” are trying to
                            build a proper defense force, “small but effective”, not equipped with
                            “obsolete weapons or second-hand equipment from Jordan or Saudi Arabia”.
                            Bahrain needs “modest things” like guns and jeeps and a few helicopters
                            and something “more than a coast guard but less than a navy”. (Shaikh
                            Hamad later said while he did not really want to have jet fighter
                            squadrons he would, of course, have to acquire them if only to prevent a
                            “vacuum in the Gulf defense belt” which would invite Iraq or Kuwait pose
                            embarrassing requests to station their aircraft in Bahrain.) Prime
                            Minister wants “to build a defensive wall around this island” so that
                            Bahraini people will feel their government can protect them, so that
                            “our neighbors will not laugh at us”, and to sustain “the morale of our
                            officers”. (Comment: That means largely Shaikh Hamad and his cousins.)
                            Prime Minister continued that he is determined to arm Bahrain adequately
                            from whatever source but obviously preferred American arms and training.
                            Bahrain, however, cannot pay the “inflated prices” private American
                            companies and the British and French ask and that the Saudis and
                            Kuwaitis can pay. As he looks around he sees <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> “helping all Bahrain’s neighbors” modernize their
                            defense forces, “seconding” military advisors and “giv<pb facs="0304"
                                n="269" xml:id="pg_269"/>ing” weapons and training. The US Navy
                            wants to stay in Bahrain, yet Bahrain has nothing of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military help to show its people and
                            its neighbors. Could not the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> “give”
                            Bahrain some tangible evidence of military assistance to justify the
                            continued US Navy use of Bahraini facilities?</p>
                        <p>6. I asked Prime Minister if this were a “personal inquiry” or should I
                            report it as a “formal government request”? Bristling somewhat, he
                            assured me this was “an official government request”. (Comment: This is
                            important point in considering our response. Prime Minister obviously
                            considers himself “the government” and yet sometimes prefers that we
                            believe the Cabinet is “the government”. While I was with Prime
                            Minister, his first cousin the Foreign Minister was receiving Admiral
                            Bigley for a farewell courtesy call, and he hewed to the “party line”
                            that, sad as it may be, Bahrain cannot keep the Navy in the absence of
                            public support from neighboring states for doing so. Recently
                            Development Minister Shirawi told me he had raised in Cabinet
                            possibility of extending Navy’s departure and had found scant sympathy
                            (Manama 711); Cabinet Affairs Minister Urrayed recently told me
                            America’s “best friends” in Cabinet would not touch OPIC’s agreement
                            until Navy left (Manama 620). These straws suggest to me Prime Minister
                            and Shaikh Hamad are off on a private feeler (probably with Amir’s
                            blessing) in asking for military assistance to justify keeping the Navy:
                            that the Cabinet, which has twice voted the Navy out of Bahrain, has not
                            yet been cut in. We have seen several indications over last two years
                            that Prime Minister has special problems when it comes to Bahrain’s
                            defense force. Personally he seems quite prone to arm the Al Khalifa to
                            the teeth, but he serves an Amir and presides over a Cabinet both openly
                            disdainful of military pretensions in this mini-state. And he must try
                            to keep his nephew the Crown Prince, who is also his subordinate the
                            Defense Minister, somehow active and amused without bleeding the public
                            purse. Hence we have long suspected they have a “deal” going in which
                            the Prime Minister will not press the Cabinet to divert public funds to
                            buy Shaikh Hamad weapons but will try to help him persuade other
                            countries to pay Bahrain’s defense tab. If this interpretation is
                            correct, then the Prime Minister is looking to us to make an offer of
                            military assistance he cannot refuse and can use both to persuade the
                            Cabinet to let the Navy stay and to keep the Crown Prince content.</p>
                        <p>7. After repeating standard remarks about US regard for Bahrain and its
                            welfare and our appreciation for Bahrain’s hospitality to US Navy, I
                            told Prime Minister (and later Shaikh Hamad) that I was of course not
                            instructed to reply to this request and could but refer it to Washington
                            with the recommendation that it receive urgent and high-level
                            consideration. But before I did so, both he and I must clearly
                            understand what he is asking:</p>
                        <pb facs="0305" n="270" xml:id="pg_270"/>
                        <p>(A) Did he understand <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> “gives”
                            nothing in military assistance to Bahrain’s neighbors: they pay for it.
                            Our present relationship with Bahrain is similar type: <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> is eligible for “Foreign Military
                            Sales”, we have provided a coastal survey and training for Bahrain’s
                            officers in the US, and are offering to send a helicopter force survey
                            team. What sort of relationship does Bahrain seek that we are not
                            already able to provide? A concessional one like Jordan and Turkey,
                            countries in very different situations, enjoy? Prime Minister
                            specifically acknowledged (and Shaikh Hamad later confirmed) that he is
                            indeed seeking a concessional arrangement such as “Jordan and Turkey”
                            have “not like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iran”. Prime Minister said
                            Bahrain wants to pay for US help, but at “special low prices”. (Shaikh
                            Hamad later said Bahrain was fully prepared to pay reasonable prices but
                            “not double the price like the Saudis do” for US military assistance and
                            furthermore would not deal directly with commercial companies and would
                            need “<gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits” or “loans” from the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to permit it to pay over time
                            for what it gets.)</p>
                        <p>(B) Did Prime Minister understand that even should <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> be able to provide a military
                            assistance program for Bahrain the types and quantities of assistance
                            provided would still be subject on a case-by-case basis to the
                            limitations imposed by our policies toward providing arms in various
                            parts of the world. He (and Shaikh Hamad later) professed to understand
                            this, contending that Bahrain’s needs are reasonable by any definition.
                            (Comment: I am still not sure they accept this reality.)</p>
                        <p>8. Then, stressing that I was now speaking “personally”, without
                            instructions and “as a friend”, I reminded Prime Minister that when
                            Foreign Minister Shaikh Mohammad had pressed Chargé Gatch back in 1971
                            for some sort of tangible evidence that Bahrain would benefit from
                            continued US Navy presence I had fielded that request in Washington.
                            Hence, counting the 1974–75 negotiations, this was the “third time
                            around” for me in the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s ever more
                            expensive efforts to demonstrate to neighbors and citizens that the
                            Navy’s presence is beneficial. I reminded Prime Minister that prior to
                            Bahrain’s independence in 1971 <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had
                            formulated a carefully reviewed and publically enunciated policy toward
                            the Gulf. One element was the decision to keep Middle East Force
                            operating out of Bahrain. We had felt this served the interests of all
                            Gulf states including Bahrain and hence have had subsequent difficulty
                            in accepting the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>’s contention that
                            the US Navy presence is a liability for which the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> must compensate in other ways. To the
                            extent our Navy imposed any inconveniences on its Bahraini hosts, we had
                            tried to adhere to the sound approach of paying for this in rent
                            because, subject to budgetary vicissitudes, the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> could be assured the Navy was good for its commitments
                            in <pb facs="0306" n="271" xml:id="pg_271"/> this regard. In 1974 <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> had suggested that our providing
                            civilian US technical advisors would broaden the US-Bahrain relationship
                            to make the continued US Navy presence more acceptable. This had given
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> little philosophical problems
                            since making civilian expert advice available to Bahrain and other Gulf
                            states had all along been a notably popular element of overall US Gulf
                            policy. How to provide a modest contribution of US public funds to this
                            end had been a problem, but the proposed technical assistance was not
                            directly linked to the US Navy presence and was justifiable on broader
                            political/economic and commercial grounds. Still it had required
                            legislative authorization, and thus eighteen months after the US
                            executive had agreed to try to help with technical assistance the
                            commitment is still not absolutely in hand, nor are the advisors in
                            Bahrain. Now Prime Minister was suggesting a very different sort of
                            condition for keeping Middle East Force in Bahrain, a concessionary
                            military aid program which would be a new departure in US policy toward
                            the Gulf. Personally I thought this request would require the most
                            intensive top-level consideration in US executive and that responding
                            favorably to it would probably require seeking legislative authorization
                            for a commitment far more controversial than providing civilian advisors
                            to assist public administration.</p>
                        <p>9. Thus I thought Prime Minister faced an awkward timing problem. It
                            seemed to me <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> might need a lot of
                            time to sort out his request, and much longer yet to deliver thorough
                            legislation on any tentative commitment it might feel able to make. Yet
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>, quite by its own choosing and
                            despite our pleadings to contrary, had imposed a June 1977 deadline for
                            US Navy’s departure, and some time soon the Navy must start taking
                            practically irreversible steps to meet it. Therefore, in my “strictly
                            personal” view, the first step should be for <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> to extend the deadline so that, without any commitment
                            by either party, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> could in propitious circumstances
                            consider under what if any conditions the Middle East Force presence
                            might continue to serve mutual interests.</p>
                        <p>10. Prime Minister ducked this by reverting to suggestion made earlier in
                            the conversation that he would be willing to make working visit to
                            Washington at appropriate time (he would prefer early fall) to discuss
                            his proposal at high level in <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. He
                            would come with “something in black and white in hand” (I took this to
                            mean an offer to “extend the agreement”) but would have to be assured in
                            advance that he would be “received as a friend”, and that <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> officials would talk with him “frankly
                            and honestly” and be prepared to give him a “definitive answer”.
                            (Comment: I take that to mean a positive commitment to provide military
                            assistance on concessional terms.)</p>
                        <p>11. I assured Prime Minister that, whenever he came to Washington, it
                            would be as a “friend” and that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            officials would always talk <pb facs="0307" n="272" xml:id="pg_272"/>
                            with him in candor. But insofar as a “definitive answer” is concerned, I
                            would have to inquire. He again urged that I seek an official response
                            to his request.</p>
                        <p>12. Comment: This request by Bahrain’s Prime Minister (and his nephew the
                            Crown Prince/Defense Minister) is far from frivolous. He would regard it
                            as sincere, reasonable and in a long-standing tradition of
                            Bahraini-American friendship. It must be handled with care.
                            Nevertheless, quite apart from fact this Bahraini attempt to raise the
                            price for keeping Middle East Force poses for US difficult question of
                            national purpose and policy the request is flawed even from the Bahraini
                            perspective.</p>
                        <p>(A) The Prime Minister is not conceding that the US Navy presence serves
                            Bahrain’s interest; it is rather to remain the perpetual liability in
                            the US-Bahraini relationship. Hence, we are expected to be ever in
                            Bahrain’s debt for its being here, and to pay, in ever more
                            controversial currency and seemingly open endedly.</p>
                        <p>(B) Apparently the Cabinet, which we have been led to believe has sole
                            power to let the Navy stay or make it go, is not offering us a deal.
                            Rather the Prime Minister is dropping us a hint that if we offer a
                            military assistance deal to the Cabinet he might be able to persuade it
                            to let the Navy stay.</p>
                        <p>(C) These “people of Bahrain”, whom the Prime Minister criticizes for
                            having wanted to “get mixed up in politics”, are being trotted out again
                            so that we might believe they can be taught to dislike the idea of our
                            Navy’s presence less as they learn to love Shaikh Hamad’s army more. We
                            have substantial reason to believe Bahrain’s defense force has scant
                            support in the Cabinet, to say nothing of among the populace at large.
                            Hence a significant <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> role in
                            developing the defense force, particularly if it involved presence of US
                            military advisors here, threatens to be controversial among Bahraini
                            public, and among some of Bahrain’s neighbors. How then could such a US
                            contribution turn critics of the US Navy presence around?</p>

                            Military Sales Policy.</p>
                        <p>1. Summary: Recently approved $3 billion defense procurement budget will
                            permit Kuwait to resume extensive military purchases through mid-1984.
                            As in the past, principal suppliers probably will include US, <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> and France, but alleged initial deal
                            with Soviets would give them about 10 percent of purchases during this
                            period. Bulk of actual intended Kuwaiti purchases still a mystery. There
                            is some cause for concern that, using ample budget to acquire still more
                            sophisticated weapons systems, Kuwait MOD will strain its absorptive
                            capacity, rather than consolidating numerous systems already purchased
                            but not all delivered. Given fundamental rationale for military sales to
                            Kuwait, to create new US political influence and leverage where little
                            now exists, Embassy believes that new procurement budget strongly
                            justifies our policy (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>) to
                            avoid major new commitments for the present, since added purchases from
                            other sources will make absorption of additional US systems still more
                            difficult. Further, our best insurance against US sales causing
                            bilateral friction due to absorption problems will be to let Kuwaitis
                            resolve these problems as best they can, to refuse sales we judge
                            difficult of absorption and to implement previously approved sales only
                            in well-planned packages of training, support systems, and equipment.
                            Otherwise, purchases from US could not only net US no political gain,
                            but US could also be made scapegoat for Kuwaiti aspirations frustrated
                            by shortages of manpower and technical skills. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Kuwaiti National Assembly approved July 19 a generous defense
                            procurement budget of 877 million Kuwaiti dinars—just over three billion
                            US dollars. (This amount is over and above Ministry of Defense single
                            year routine operating budget of about $260 million for July 76–June 77
                            period.) Procurement budget figure was arrived at, as usual, during
                            closed sessions of the Assembly and prior private “hearings” of
                            Assembly’s financial committee. No procurement budget line items <pb
                                facs="0309" n="274" xml:id="pg_274"/> are available publicly, but we
                            understand that budget is intended to cover MOD procurement through
                            mid-1984. (The last multi-year MOD procurement budget of approximately
                            $1.5 billion was intended to suffice over 1973–1980 period, but the 1973
                            funds apparently were exhausted in the spring of 1976.)</p>
                        <p>3. We have no clear idea yet how the <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss>
                            will use the bulk of the procurement funds provided in this latest
                            budget. We can, however, forecast some probable and possible purchases
                            in the next few years which logic says it would pay for. With this
                            caveat in mind, Department may be interested in the following
                            preliminary estimates of the major military matériel and services which
                                <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> may acquire with multi-year
                            procurement budget:</p>
                        <p>A. Military Technical Training Center, which <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> has refused to provide under <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss>, but for which US private source may yet receive
                            contract.</p>
                        <p>B. Navy-associated purchases, including patrol boats (from as yet unknown
                            source—the <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> is now receiving bids);
                            missile system for patrol boats (probably French); hovercraft (probably
                            British); basic naval training (possibly US) for 200 sailors; and port
                            equipment and supplies.</p>
                        <p>C. Ground equipment, which reportedly will include Soviet tactical
                            missiles, may include Soviet anti-aircraft guns, and apparently will
                            involve considerable additional equipment and presence of Soviet
                            personnel, all part of alleged $300 million sales package. Other ground
                            matériel may include US-source equipment for two self-propelled Howitzer
                            battalions in addition to 160 <gloss target="#t_APC_1">APCs</gloss>, for
                            which <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> contracts are now under
                            preparation.</p>
                        <p>D. National Command and Control System of as yet unknown origin. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> apparently plans to request
                            bids and then bargain with a number of private firms, probably including
                            US firms, for manufacture and installation of this expensive system.</p>
                        <p>4. Adding together order of magnitude values of items noted above, we
                            come nowhere close to $3 billion total budget level. Figure may include
                            considerable sum for military construction, including naval ports,
                            airfields and facilities for conscripts, and it may reflect Kuwaiti
                            experience with previous multi-year budget of half this amount which was
                            used up in less than half the seven year obligation period.</p>
                        <p>5. In Embassy’s view, the <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> would be
                            wise to delay future purchases of major items of equipment until items
                            already purchased are received and absorbed into Kuwaiti military
                            forces. Major items ordered, but not all delivered include: Mirage, A–4,
                            and C–9 aircraft; Gazelle and Puma helicopters; Chieftain tanks; IHawk;
                            and <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss>. Kuwaiti absorptive capacity
                            (particularly in Air Force) is already <pb facs="0310" n="275"
                                xml:id="pg_275"/> strained and will, in our estimation, reach
                            embarrassingly critical point in 1977 when French and US aircraft
                            deliveries are in full swing and IHawk program is well underway.
                            Moreover, we learned recently that, contrary to our earlier
                            understanding, Air Force plans to retain its old British lightning
                            fighters until 1980, which will delay needed improvement in overall
                            Kuwaiti aircraft maintenance capability.</p>
                        <p>6. Also, Soviet ground equipment deliveries in 1977, if any, on top of
                            British Chieftain tank deliveries (beginning in September 1976) could
                            well aggravate absorptive problems of ground forces unless Soviets are
                            as careful as British will be to prepare the Kuwaitis to receive new
                            matériel. Owing to long lead times contemplated for major US ground
                            equipment, we are unable to estimate yet the absorption problems which
                            the delivery of such equipment would cause—the possible sale of
                            equipment for two US self-propelled Howitzer battalions is the leading
                            case in point. On the plus side, Kuwait’s first conscription law is
                            scheduled to go into effect in 1977 and, we assume, US self-propelled
                            Howitzers (and related equipment) and <gloss target="#t_APC_1"
                                >APC</gloss>’s would not be delivered until at least two years
                            thereafter. On the other hand:</p>
                        <p>A. There is now serious shortage of both people and technical skills
                            required for any major new ground equipment:</p>
                        <p>B. Purchase of major equipment would require permanent expansion of
                            ground forces with large numbers of raw recruits;</p>
                        <p>C. We are not persuaded that <gloss target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> is
                            prepared to make conscription work. It is anybody’s guess whether what
                            will be politically controversial conscription system will provide
                            Kuwaiti soldiers in sufficient numbers, be structured to retain them, or
                            will be accompanied by major technical training effort necessary to
                            enable conscripts to operate and maintain exotic purchases from various
                            sources; and</p>
                        <p>D. We are not convinced that MOD will be able to organize Army logistical
                            system to service new purchases from all sources, though careful
                            packaging and implementation of US sales could reduce logistical
                            problems peculiar to US equipment.</p>
                        <p>7. Underlying rationale for US military sales to Kuwait is fundamentally
                            political and bilateral—we now have little leverage on <gloss
                                target="#t_GOK_1">GOK</gloss> and we seek more. Hence, we have
                            strong interest in seeing that Kuwaiti military modernization proceeds
                            with minimum bilateral irritation. We are concerned, however, that
                            Kuwaitis may well not postpone further major equipment purchases, given
                            their apparently ample new budget. We are also concerned that Kuwaitis’
                            attention may be taken up by glamorous new purchases and that they will
                            continue to have relatively little interest in the consolidation of
                            their matériel position (insufficient attention to administrative and
                            logistical systems, particularly parts control, technical training and
                            basic military construction necessary for proper storage, maintenance
                            and repair.) Our British colleagues here <pb facs="0311" n="276"
                                xml:id="pg_276"/> share these concerns, and even the French
                            acknowledge that the Kuwait Air Force will have difficulty maintaining
                            up to high standards the bulk of its past and current French aircraft
                            purchases within the foreseeable future. There is some risk, therefore,
                            that US could become a scapegoat for what seems to be developing into an
                            increasingly expensive and perhaps even more disorderly modernization of
                            Kuwaiti forces.</p>
                        <p>8. In this situation, we believe that the rationale for US policy on US
                            military sales to Kuwait and the central policy provided <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>—no major new commitments in
                            Kuwait until ongoing programs are well established—remain realistic and
                            valid. We also believe that we should continue to eschew broad military
                            advisory effort in Kuwait, though the Kuwaitis might possibly request
                            this as their absorption problem mounts. (But this is their problem;
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should merely avoid
                            contributing to it.) In addition, we would underline the need for <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to refuse sales we judge difficult of
                            absorption and to resolve that any <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            sales implemented under this policy will be structured only as full-cost
                            packages, including adequate training and support services in addition
                            to matériel. To do otherwise would invite long-term bilateral irritation
                            over our military supply relationship—rather than political gain.</p>

                        <p>1. We do not believe it would be useful for us to furnish Shaikh Hamad
                            with unclassified technical and promotional material on F–5 aircraft.
                            Sale of F–5s is outside existing criteria for arms sales to lower Gulf
                            states, and we simply do not see exceptional military or political
                            justification for change in policy now on this issue.</p>
                        <p>2. We are concerned that furnishing unclassified material could be
                            misunderstood by <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>, despite best
                            effort on our part, as constituting some <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> obligation to sell F–5s if <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1"
                                >GOQ</gloss> so requested. We therefore conclude such material
                            should not be provided. Should <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss> read
                            our position as indicating lack of interest in country’s security, you
                            might wish reiterate broad general lines of our arms policy to Qataris,
                            emphasizing that we see their security in terms of regional cooperation
                            particularly in close cooperation with their two larger neighbors. We
                            are prepared to consider defense items needed for Qatar’s internal
                            security purposes. F–5 aircraft, however, are sophisticated weapons
                            whose sale could be misunderstood by other small states in the Gulf
                            where we have established same restraints. Thus, we are not
                            discriminating against Qatar.</p>
                        <p>3. We agree with Embassy Tehran’s view (ref C) that regional cooperation
                            for military supply, training and facilities will have to come from the
                            states themselves. We think restraint on our part in responding to
                            bilateral requests for sophisticated equipment from lower Gulf states is
                            more likely to bring about regional cooperation than acceding to this
                            type of request from <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1">GOQ</gloss>. <gloss

                            willing to give this proposal careful consideration. End <gloss

                            Lower Gulf. Ref: State 220256, Doha 0862, Doha 0863.</p>
                        <p>1. I accept Dept’s judgment that it better to cut off discussion of F–5s
                            with Qataris at this point since eventual sale cannot <gloss
                                target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> cannot be considered under present
                            policy guidelines, and since there appears no justification for any
                            change in policy. I hope we can get some mileage out of this with
                            congressional critics of massive <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            sales in area—not only do we refuse to sell to Qatar, but we even deny
                            it opportunity to window shop.</p>
                        <p>2. I intend to delay conveying this word to Shaykh Hamad until after
                            Ramadan, although I wonder whether it any more desirable on full than
                            empty stomach. I will also take early opportunity after it to explain
                            this whole matter to the Amir. With both the Amir and Shaykh Hamad, I
                            plan to reiterate in detail our lower Gulf arms policy and, unless Dept
                            has objection, to illustrate by telling them without naming specific
                            recipient countries about our current military activities in lower Gulf
                            states, e.g. helicopter survey with possible follow on sales, supply of
                            M–16s but denial of TOWs, etc. I think we owe Qataris this much, but it
                            is not my intention to whet their appetites for other military goodies.
                            I’d be perfectly content if we never sold Qataris as much as one bullet.
                            We have avoided taking any initiatives in military supply field here,
                            and will continue to do so.</p>
                        <p>3. Although I do not expect Amir or Shaykh Hamad to say so directly, I
                            know they will be disappointed by our refusal to provide info re F–5s.
                            All explanations of our lower Gulf arms policy and examples of its
                            implementation notwithstanding, they will see picture elementally, i.e.
                            billions of dollars in military hardware for Saudi Arabia and Iran,
                            hundreds of millions for Kuwait, and not even a catalog for Qatar. They
                            will simply not understand our refusal not even to provide information
                            on what may amount to a sale of a “few planes for a few millions.” They
                            will see this, not specifically as <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            lack of interest in <pb facs="0314" n="279" xml:id="pg_279"/> Qatar’s
                            security, but as confirmation of what they already believe is <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> lack of interest in Qatar in general.
                            We and Qataris have lived with this since establishment of the Embassy,
                            and can continue to do so, although what <gloss target="#t_GOQ_1"
                                >GOQ</gloss> regards as our benign neglect of Qatar is a problem in
                            our relations.</p>
                        <p>4. On broader question of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> taking
                            initiative to regionalize arms supply relationships with lower Gulf
                            states within context of our already established military relationships
                            with Saudi Arabia and Iran, I appreciate addressees’ comments, and
                            rationale of their negative consensus. I suppose we’re too far along
                            with Saudi Arabia and Iran and not far enough along with lower Gulf
                            states to establish framework of this kind. However, if we wait for
                            indigenous initiative for regional security arrangements that will
                            include coordinated arms supply, this may come about day after Shah
                            recognizes Gulf as Arab. I continue to believe that present leverage
                            available to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> as primary arms
                            supplier to area and desired military partner gives us the influence to
                            catalyze regional security arrangements which may enable us to reduce
                            magnitude of our arms sales in region. There is no question that
                            pressures to reduce our overall arms sales in area and world will
                            intensify, and there should be some way of our getting ahead of this

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> thanked the Foreign
                            Minister for Bahrain’s submission of written reservations to the recent
                            Colombo Non-Aligned Conference resolutions on the issues of Puerto Rico
                            and Korea. Shaikh Mohammad said he had argued with other delegations
                            that, on Puerto Rico, there was no point in selecting an unjust cause to
                            mount an “anti-American” campaign, pointing out the Puerto Ricans had
                            voted by democratic procedure for a status now being criticized by
                            governments which by and large were themselves not popularly elected. He
                            expressed satisfaction that in the non-aligned world the Korean issue is
                            beginning to come into proper perspective as the South Koreans finally
                            begin to assert themselves in arguing their own case as diligently as
                            the North Koreans long have pressed theirs. Shaikh Mohammad said Bahrain
                            wants to keep in close communication with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> on multinational issues in the hope of being

                            it is possible to do so within the realities of Bahrain’s own interests

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> raised the Lebanese
                            situation, describing it as distressing and a diversion from the central
                            task of pressing on with a Middle East peace settlement.</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Mohammad expressed concern that Syria has become bogged down in
                            Lebanon, unable to pull out or press forward without painful cost. He
                            stressed the conviction that only the Lebanese themselves could provide
                            the essential first step to the solution to their problem by
                            establishing an effective government under Sarkis. He said that Sarkis,
                            while offering new hope, is presently powerless. Nevertheless he feels
                            that amid the diverse groups on each side there are “responsible”
                            leaders, among the Muslims and notably Gemayal among the Christians, who
                            could rally around Sarkis to create a constructive Lebanese nucleus
                            which other Arab states could support morally, politically,
                            economically, and even militarily under proper circumstances. He said
                            the problem of the Palestinians in Lebanon cannot be effectively
                            addressed until the Lebanese form an effective government under
                            Sarkis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had hoped that the holding of a
                            “mini-summit” might help the search for a solution. He said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, having good relations with
                            both Egypt and Syria and respect for their leaders, is pained by the
                            current breach between them. Noting that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> agrees with Shaikh Mohammad on the need for all
                            parties interested in peace in Lebanon to support Sarkis as much as
                            possible, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said for
                            its part the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would welcome
                            receiving Lebanese representatives coming to talk with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. This would
                            symbolize our support for a solution under Sarkis’ leadership. The
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is also willing to help with
                            economic aid for reconstruction and politically by helping keep channels
                            of communication among the various parties open.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">GULF COOPERATION AND SECURITY</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>’s
                            query Shaikh Mohammad evaluated the prospects for stability as
                            encouraging to date. He noted with satisfaction that Kuwait’s recent
                            clamp down on press and parliament would have a stabilizing effect,
                            checking the possible spread of political factionalism in the wake of
                            the Lebanese problem. Shaikh Mohammad said democratic government is
                            something to which Gulf states must aspire but that he is persuaded that
                            at the present level of social development they are not yet ready for
                            it. He assumed this view would be difficult for the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Congress to accept.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> replied that in his
                            recent testimony before Congress on Human Rights in Iran he had found
                            broad understanding that Middle Eastern countries address the issue of
                            representative govern<pb facs="0317" n="282" xml:id="pg_282"/>ment in an
                            historic context different from our own. He added that recent
                            developments in Kuwait were not even raised in that hearing.</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Mohammad continued that there is more cooperation generally among
                            Gulf states and that Saudi Arabia in particular is playing a more active
                            role than in the past. Tensions between Iraq and Iran have relaxed and
                            confidence is growing between the Gulf Arabs and Iran. But the idea of a
                            security pact is drifting; the initiative here must come from the big
                            states—Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">ARMS SALES</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Mohammad in this connection stressed the importance of US help in
                            developing the Saudi defense capability to permit the appearance of
                            something like a balance with Iran. He professed full confidence in the
                            Shah’s intentions, but suggested that semblance of balance between Saudi
                            Arabia and Iran creates an atmosphere in which confidence and
                            cooperation in Gulf security matters can develop.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> noted that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy is based precisely on such a
                            concept of regional cooperation with the larger states, Saudi Arabia and
                            Iran playing the leading role. He then explained the status of
                            Congressional consideration of the sale of Mavericks to Saudi Arabia,
                            stressing the active role the Administration had played in support of
                            the sale. Shaikh Mohammad expressed delight that the sale apparently
                            will go through, especially since the Saudis had apparently placed their
                            own prestige on the line on this issue.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> spoke of our

                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy’s use of facilities in
                            Bahrain to continue somewhat longer. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> does not consider that the time has come to withdraw
                            this longstanding symbol of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            interest in the Gulf/Indian Ocean area. Pointing out some worldwide
                            concern about American constancy post-Viet Nam, he suggested the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy’s withdrawal from Bahrain next
                            summer might be misinterpreted as a symbol of lessened commitment to the
                            Indian Ocean area. Hence Bahrain’s retaining Middle East Force could
                            contribute to the overall interests of the Gulf states.</p>
                        <pb facs="0318" n="283" xml:id="pg_283"/>
                        <p>Shaikh Mohammad replied at length: The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> and Bahrain have common interests in the stability of
                            the Gulf, but he is at a loss to see how today Middle East Force can be
                            considered helpful in the long term to those interests. Through the Navy
                            presence the United States presents the wrong image in the Gulf. Middle
                            East Force is of no strategic significance; it is at worst harmful, at
                            best unhelpful. By withdrawing it the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> would improve its relations in the area. Shaikh
                            Mohammad said the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role in
                            modernizing Saudi Arabia defense forces is the sort of constructive
                            military contribution the United States can make in the area. By
                            contrast the Middle East Force presence symbolizes a direct great power
                            role working in opposition to the concept of Iranian/Arab cooperation in
                            providing for area security. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Navy presence in Bahrain tends to attract rather than
                            counter Soviet naval presence in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> questioned whether
                            anyone really believes the withdrawal of Middle East Force from Bahrain
                            would keep the Soviets out of the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Mohammad agreed it would not, but insisted that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy presence is further excuse for
                            Soviet interest in navy visits to Iraq. He added that no one in the Gulf
                            objects to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy visits; quite the
                            contrary. It is the permanent presence that is objectionable. With
                            respect to Bahrain’s specific problem, Shaikh Mohammad emphasized that
                            no significant practical problem had been caused by the presence of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy personnel. Many Bahrainis
                            recognize the specific advantages derived from the Navy presence. The
                            problem is that Bahrainis, in reaction to a neo-colonial history in
                            which Bahrain was Britain’s “base” in the Gulf, cannot accept
                            psychologically the idea of a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Navy
                            presence. This is as true in the absence of a National Assembly as it
                            was during the days of the Assembly. Reviewing the post-independence
                            history of the Middle East Force issue, Shaikh Mohammad pointed out that
                            the Government by trying to find a more palatable context in which to
                            present the Navy presence had been able to extend use of the facilities
                            from October 1973 until June 1977. But Bahrain has received no support
                            from neighbors; it bears the burden alone. Now the time has come to end
                            the presence, not to risk extending it for one more year or two.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> asked if there were
                            not some differences of opinion within the Bahraini Government on this
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Mohammad said there are; he would not make the final decision, but
                            he wanted the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government to
                            understand clearly where he stands as Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> asked if some
                            thought had not been given to what the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> might give Bahrain in return for extending the June
                            1977 deadline.</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Mohammad said that sort of approach, usable in 1974–75, had been
                            overtaken by events. Saudi Arabia is giving Bahrain help in <pb
                                facs="0319" n="284" xml:id="pg_284"/> the hundred millions;
                            increasing the Navy rent somewhat above $4 million a year would not meet
                            the political issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said he understands
                            there had been some thought of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            military assistance in return for continuing the Navy presence.</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Mohammad laughed and said that sort of reasoning might “appeal to
                            our military people” just as it might appeal “to your Navy”.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">MILITARY ASSISTANCE: CONGRESSIONAL ATTITUDES</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> explained the types
                            of concern which appear to motivate Congressional criticism of arms
                            sales on security assistance programs in the Gulf area.</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Mohammad replied that it is not only the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Congress which is concerned about the flow of arms to
                            the area. Realistically, however, the United States cannot discriminate
                            among friends. “Country A” wants the same weapons “country B” gets. In
                            the case of the Saudis, they are faced with the Soviet arming of Iraq
                            and <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> noted that Saudi
                            Arabia must look at long range contingencies in its military
                            modernization plans.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">REGIONAL SCENE—MIDDLE EAST PEACE</p>
                        <p>Shaikh Mohammad agreed, expressing long term concern about the political
                            stability of the Sub-continent and its eventual vulnerability to
                            communist takeover from within.</p>

                            certain hopeful trends in the Middle East and South Asian scene, ending
                            by affirming the wide and growing recognition of the <gloss

                            Minister to act as his translator, a role which the Foreign Minister
                            began but which rapidly was transformed into that of spokesman for the

                            Minister has not been able to visit Washington for discussions earlier
                            in the month, <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> raised
                            question of tenure of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>
                            in Bahrain. The Amir asked the Foreign Minister to speak on behalf of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>. Foreign Minister proceeded to
                            state that at present time <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> has
                            “nothing new” to say on the subject but it would <pb facs="0321" n="286"

                            At <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> urging, Foreign
                            Minister then proceeded forcefully to summarize <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> position very much along lines of his recent meeting
                            with Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> in New York (State 246032). The thrust of the
                            message was that in absence of some “new formula”, which no one seems to
                            have found, the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> must stick to its
                            decision that <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> depart
                            Bahrain in June 1977. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>,
                            in turn, expressed regret that <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> saw situation in this light, with which he could not
                            agree, and reviewed regional situation as viewed by <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, stressing potential instability and
                            volatility in Persian Gulf region for next three years as Saudi Arabia
                            and Iran move ahead to create viable defense forces for regional
                            security purposes.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> stressed his serious
                            disappointment at <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> attitude, which
                            he said surprised him. Foreign Minister responded by reiterating <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> view that “burden” of <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> must be shared
                            regionally. He stated that Bahrain had sounded out regional neighbors
                            over past three years but that none was prepared to publicly support
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> presence in
                            Bahrain. He complained that privately they tell the Bahrainis that
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>’s continued
                            tenure is acceptable, and even desirable in some cases, but decline to
                            do so publicly. Bahrain feels the “lonely burden” of hosting a great
                            power base is too great for it in the absence of open regional support.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> pointed out the
                            constraints on Saudi Arabia in view of its wider role in the search for
                            Middle East peace and stability. It could not be identified publicly
                            with <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> because of this
                            broader role which the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> understood
                            and appreciated. Each country, he pointed out, must carry a different
                            burden. Foreign Minister reiterated <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>
                            view that “burden” must be shared regionally. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> again expressed his
                            disappointment at <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> decision Foreign
                            Minister replied that it was an unhappy decision for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>, made over the past three years. He
                            said that what was needed was a “new arrangement” which would have the
                            effect of relieving Bahrain of some of its burden. He said that he had
                            been looking for such new arrangement but had not found anything
                            acceptable. The Amir broke into the conversation at this point to ask
                            how many years extension the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            wanted. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> replied that we
                            are looking for a three year extension to bridge the time until local
                            forces (i.e., Saudi Arabia and Iran) could take over responsibility for
                            regional stability. Amir stated that further discussions could be held
                            with the newly-arrived Ambassador—to which both <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> and Ambassador replied that
                            time is short since <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>
                            must begin to reduce its presence very soon. Admiral Crowe said that
                            January 1977 was the date for the initiation of <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> staff and logistics
                            reductions. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> noted that
                            if <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> presence was not
                            seen by the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> as being in its
                            interest, then it would go. “We only stay where we are wanted.”</p>

                        <p>1. Summary: Foreign Minister took occasion of my call on him Nov. 4 to
                            raise issue of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> and to
                            state in strong terms that decision that <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> withdraw was <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> policy, decided in Cabinet, and that that policy has
                            not changed. He expressed surprise that during his talks here <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> seemed to think
                            otherwise since Foreign Minister had explained <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"

                            interjected that conversations last summer between Prime Minister and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1">Twinam</persName> and Chargé, as
                            well as my own talk with Prime Minister Oct. 26 (Manama 1685), gave
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> sound reason to believe that
                            issue is not closed. Indeed, Foreign Minister himself in Amir’s meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>, as well as on
                            previous occasions, left this impression and had proposed that “new
                            formula” be found for <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                            >MIDEASTFOR</gloss>. Foreign Minister said formula he has in mind, which
                            he claimed to have advanced to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            before, is that <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> as
                            such be “disbanded” but that US Navy ships continue their mission in
                            area by staying and resupplying in other ports, Saudi and Iranian, as
                            well as in Bahrain. In short, “spread the burden”. But Foreign Minister
                            said he wanted it clearly understood that <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> as it is now “will go”,
                            adding that he would not be at all surprised if new US administration
                            took initiative to withdraw <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss>, which as foreign base is not very popular with
                            many Democrats on Capitol Hill. End summary.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> seemed not to be aware
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> had decided, in cabinet, that
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> should leave
                            Bahrain in June 1977. Foreign Minister said he had explained <gloss

                            in New York and, therefore, felt that <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName>’ expressions of surprise and disappointment
                            were unwarranted. He stressed point that he did not make policy, the
                            cabinet did. Nothing, he added, has happened to change that cabinet
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>3. Interjecting, I said that series of conversations last summer between
                            Prime Minister and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1"
                                >Twinam</persName>, Admiral Bigley, and Chargé Burleigh gave <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> good reason to believe that issue of
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> tenure remained
                            open for discussion between our governments. I reminded Foreign Minister
                            that he himself had said on numerous occasions, including during
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> visit, that “new
                            formula” for <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> needed
                            to be devised. Amir, during <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName>’ visit, had said that there would be further
                            discussion between us on this subject. This did not sound to me as if
                            the issue were closed. Foreign Minister replied that perhaps there has
                            been a misunderstanding. <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> policy is
                            that <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> as it is now—a
                            big power base which is a heavy burden for Bahrain—should leave in June
                            1977. Mission which <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>
                            performs could be continued under another label. He said he has
                            suggested to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> “for years” that
                            political burden of <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>
                            must be shared in the region. I asked for specifics and he said that
                            Navy ships could call here for resupply, stay a month or so, and then do
                            the same in Saudi and/or Iranian ports. Foreign Minister said Bahrain
                            takes heavy criticism, in <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and among
                            Third World countries, for being host to a super power base when, in
                            fact, there are more <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military
                            personnel in both Saudi Arabia and Iran. Question, then, is how to
                            change the image of a “base” to something else. He asserted that some
                            such arrangement as he described would be in our interest as well,
                            including in administration’s relation with Congress. Indeed, he would
                            not be surprised if new administration took initiative to withdraw
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>, or at least to
                            change its nature, perhaps along the lines he suggested, rather than try
                            to retain a base in an era when bases are unpopular, even within United
                            States Congress.</p>
                        <p>4. Foreign Minister went on to stress Bahrain’s desire for continued
                            friendly relations, including the continuation of its excellent
                            relations with the US Navy “in some other form”. He repeated his
                            well-known reasons for feeling that <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1"
                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> withdrawal is in best <gloss target="#t_GOB_1"
                                >GOB</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> interests,
                            adding that <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> is sensitive to wider
                            concerns since at time of last renewal of <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> agreement Bahrain had
                            consulted other Arab states and had successfully argued that renewal was
                            in <pb facs="0324" n="289" xml:id="pg_289"/> best interest US-Arab
                            relations, particularly during period of sensitive shuttle diplomacy. I
                            said that his argument remains valid. It is as important now,
                            particularly as new US administration comes into office, as it was then
                            that neither the US nor its Arab friends send signals which can be
                            deliberately distorted to their advantage by the enemies of a peaceful
                            Middle East settlement. I felt withdrawal of <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> next summer would be
                            such a signal and that, conversely, extension of <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>, within context of
                            expanding and mutually beneficial US-Bahrain relations, including in
                            military field, would be supportive of both US role in area and of roles
                            of those Arab states working toward peace.</p>
                        <p>5. Picking up on my mention of <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> military
                            relations, Foreign Minister said he thought it “fine” that Defense
                            Minister is getting survey team but that, as Shaikh Hamad said during
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>’ visit, US has been
                            slow in this area and what we are planning now, the survey team, cannot
                            really effect the “bigger issues.” I replied that team will come very
                            soon, that of course it will do its work according to our commitment to
                            Shaikh Hamad, but that future of our relations in military, as in other
                            fields, will depend on full context of our relations. In this context
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>’s continuing
                            ability to play its role in region and beyond is issue to which we
                            attach great importance, and to which I expected I will be instructed to
                            return.</p>
                        <p>6. Foreign Minister said that military area is not his province, though
                            he is pleased that <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> is now getting
                            attention it has sought, but he did want to emphasize again that while
                                <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss> is willing to discuss some “new
                            formula”, which should include neighbors, which would permit <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> mission to continue,
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> as it now exists
                            in Bahrain “will go” in June 1977. I said I would of course report his
                            views but that, as he knew, US feels that <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> has a value and a
                            purpose of importance to both our countries and to the Gulf region and
                            beyond which we do not want lightly to relinquish. While interesting,
                            his ideas for, in effect, multiple homeports for <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> struck me as
                            logistically very difficult and perhaps politically so as well in view
                            of major roles Saudi Arabia and Iran now playing in area and in US-area
                            relations. Foreign Minister said he had one last point to make and,
                            rising, said he wondered if <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had not
                            already approached Saudis about “helping” with <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>, perhaps during
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> travels, and been
                            turned down. I said I knew of no such approach.</p>
                        <p>7. Comment: Foreign Minister was cordial as usual throughout our
                            conversation. Though at times less forceful in expression than in his
                            conversation during <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>’
                            visit, he also seemed more self-confident and assured in speaking for
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>. Directly and by implication he
                            made it clear that it was a Cabinet decision, which has not been <pb
                                facs="0325" n="290" xml:id="pg_290"/> changed, that <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> in its present form be
                            withdrawn. Though he told <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> in New York that his word on this issue would
                            not be the final one, Foreign Minister spoke today as if his words had
                            the backing of the man or men who do have the final word. It strikes me
                            that if in recent weeks Prime Minister has been less than very
                            commanding in dealing with his Cabinet colleagues about extending <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>, Foreign Minister may
                            have gained Cabinet consensus to wait and see what posture of new US
                            administration will be toward area as a whole and toward <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> specifically. Though
                            informed and sophisticated in assessing the meaning of our elections for
                            US policy, Foreign Minister clearly feels that new administration may
                            take quite different view of form and locale of US commitments abroad.
                            In absence of firm “marching orders” from Amir and Prime Minister,
                            Foreign Minister could have made good case for wait and see posture.</p>
                        <p>8. If indeed Prime Minister’s initiative of last summer has been shelved
                            by the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>, we ought to learn this
                            directly from him. It is increasingly difficult in my view for us to
                            feel our way politically, or for the Navy to plan rationally, when we
                            are getting one set of signals, which have weakened over the months,
                            from the Prime Minister and another, increasingly assertive set from the
                            Foreign Minister. I recommend, therefore, that I be instructed to call
                            on the Prime Minister, present him with the details of the composition,
                            arrival dates and funding arrangements for the survey team, and of
                            course make the point contained in the last sentence of <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>. (Foreign Minister was clearly
                            uninterested in the details of the team and I preferred to hold them for
                            future use.) Also, I would like to discuss with Prime Minister in candid
                            fashion the differences, and problems, we see between extending <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> in its present form and
                            the concepts put forth today by the Foreign Minister. I would also point
                            out the essential continuities of US interests and note as well that
                            lifting the deadline now would not preclude a later decision by either
                            side for withdrawal, and it would give us the time fully to examine
                            those Bahraini concerns which he and Shaikh Hamad have raised with
                            us.</p>
                        <p>9. I understand Admiral Crowe will request that survey team not come
                            until about Nov. 22, after his return from Mid-Link Exercise. This delay
                            would not exceed the 30 days arrival promised by <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> and it would help <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> and Embassy to have
                                <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> in port in order
                            assist in administrative support for team.</p>

                            (A) State 283435, (B) Manama 1941.</p>
                        <p>1. I have been giving much thought to your message concerning <gloss
                                target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> and your instruction
                            that this problem be raised with Saudi leaders at the earliest opportune
                            moment. I shall of course seek that moment and in fact have commenced
                            preparation for demarche by recalling to Crown Prince our concern about
                            Soviet activity in East Africa and Indian Ocean. I believe, however,
                            that your chance of enlisting Saudi assistance will be enhanced if there
                            is first some progress in Bahrain itself, perhaps the response promised
                                <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CWTI_1"
                                >Cluverius</persName> by the Prime Minister (ref B). It is quite
                            unlikely that Saudis would move along lines we favor while the results
                            of the <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> pitch on October
                            24 remain most recent indication Saudis have of Bahrain attitude. We can
                            feel quite sure they are well informed about content of that
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>2. If you feel our national interests require that we incur relatively
                            greater risks of early approach to Saudis regardless of attitudes in
                            Bahrain, I will make demarche as soon as I can get an appointment. I
                            must and do recommend, however, against latter course.</p>

                            stationing agreement beyond its 30 June 1977 expiration date, we have
                            been unsuccessful so far in budging Bahrain from the deadline it has
                            imposed.</p>
                        <p>Based upon the report of our Ambassador’s 28 December meeting with
                            Bahrain’s Foreign Minister, the <gloss target="#t_GOB_1">GOB</gloss>
                            currently displays distressingly little flexibility in its approach to
                            the <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss> issue. The
                            Bahrainis have rejected our request to alleviate the time pressures
                            exerted on the new US Administration by the mid-1977 termination.</p>
                        <p>Though six months remain before the agreement formally lapses, an orderly
                            withdrawal from Bahrain by the end of June requires the commencement of
                            phase-down activities in February. Delay of departure preparations
                            beyond February will place further hardships upon some 600 <gloss

                                >MIDEASTFOR</gloss> withdrawal that must be dealt with soon is
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s future relationship with the

                            and businessmen at Bahrain. Additionally, a way must be devised to
                            satisfy the communications support requirements of the US Military
                            Training Mission at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia and the Defense Fuel Quality
                            Assurance Office at Bahrain; both organizations now rely on the <gloss

                        <p>During my visit to Bahrain in late October, the Bahrainis stressed that
                            they sought US cooperation in modernizing and expanding the <pb

                            Subsequently, and as a prelude to fashioning a mutually acceptable <hi

                            November a comprehensive, on-site survey of Bahrain’s defense
                            requirements. We are now studying the survey team’s findings and
                            preparing our recommendations for further negotiations with Bahrain.</p>
                        <p>Simultaneously, we are reviewing alternatives to the existing arrangement
                            with Bahrain for <gloss target="#t_MIDEASTFOR_1">MIDEASTFOR</gloss>
                            operations after mid-1977 and the options appear less attractive than
                            Bahrain. We should persist in our search for a solution that will permit
                            the Force to remain in the region.</p>
                        <p>Before it becomes necessary to begin withdrawal steps in February, the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should be in a position to
                            present to Bahrain a proposal that defines specifically 1) the security

                            Bahrain that might accommodate the Foreign Minister’s repeatedly
                            professed desire for a “new formula.” Further, it would be desirable to
                            precede this approach to Bahrain with a request for Saudi Arabia to use
                            its influence on our behalf in resolving the <gloss

                        <p>318. Department pass Cairo. Subject: Saqqaf Dilates on Arab Pressures
                            Against Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>Summary. Saqqaf expressed warm satisfaction with Department’s restatement
                            US position on Jerusalem but went on reiterate and embroider his
                            favorite theme: Difficulties and risks Saudi Arabia encounters because
                            of US failure move more vigorously toward Arab-Israel solution, other
                            Arabs, Saqqaf claim urge Saudi Arabia consider how it can use its oil
                            resources as political lever. Saqqaf said Israeli attacks on Syria bring
                            pinpricks from other Arabs while Beirut press attacks him personally as
                            Arab enemy. Saqqaf asked if Ambassador could give him helpful message
                            which would strengthen Saqqaf’s position at upcoming Cairo meeting.
                            Ambassador noted press attacks probably inevitable and Israeli raids on
                            Syria are abhorrent but inevitable response to terrorism. Ambassador
                            reviewed fundamentals of US position in support of negotiations and
                            endeavored respond Saqqaf’s misgivings. While latter has frequently
                            stressed “pressure” Saudis feel from other Arabs, his more reasoned and
                            intense manner in latest discussion seem reveal genuine, increased
                            concern with difficulties Saudi Arabia faces. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. During call on other matters I handed Saqqaf copy <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> release of Department’s letter to
                            Congressman Hamilton restating US position on Jerusalem. Saqqaf welcomed
                            it warmly, had heard it on radio and felt it constituted most helpful
                            and encouraging declaration.</p>
                        <p>2. He launched then into his favorite theme: The difficulties and risks
                            which accrue to Saudi Arabia because of failure <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> to move vigorously toward Arab-Israel solution. At
                            every gathering of top-level Arab officials there is always pressure on
                            Saudi representatives to “get your friends the Americans to do
                            something” with broad hints that Saudi Arabia should think harder about
                            how it could use its oil resources as a political lever vis-à-vis <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Saudi Arabia is considered <pb
                                facs="0332" n="297" xml:id="pg_297"/> natural exponent of Arab
                            viewpoint because of close relations between two countries, and Saudis
                            are urged to exhort Americans harder. (At this point, Saqqaf affirmed
                            both his own personal conviction and that of his own government that
                            close friendship with US is basic principal of Saudi policy and one we
                            prepared to support fully).</p>
                        <p>3. This kind of pressure is never-ending Saqqaf asserted. Every time the
                            Israelis attack a Syrian village other Arabs wonder why Saudi Arabia
                            doesn’t take a more aggressive stance. Here he digressed to describe
                            dreadful impact of Israeli attacks which have destroyed more than 100
                            million pounds of Syrian property, have entirely destroyed one Syrian
                            village near cease-fire line with serious damage also to Altakin. He
                            enumerated incidents where Beirut press have subjected him to personal
                            abuse joining his picture with that of Shah of Iran as Arab enemies.
                            Saqqaf (whose name in Arabic means a roofer) is identified as “ceiling
                            over American policy” etc. Kuwait feels some but not such heavy pressure
                            but is, of course, more liable to react to it. Saqqaf summed it all up
                            by asking what helpful message I could give him to take to strengthen
                            Saudi Arabia’s position at upcoming Cairo Foreign Ministers meeting.</p>
                        <p>4. As to newspaper stories, I told Saqqaf every viewpoint had its own
                            claque in the Middle East and every prominent Arab must expect attack
                            from some quarter. Saqqaf said he realized much of criticism against him
                            was probably paid for but more important was that constant reiteration
                            these stories tended undermine public confidence and encourage more
                            serious political pressures against Saudi Arabia. With regard attacks on
                            Syria, said Saqqaf knew we abhored these as much as killing of athletes
                            at Munich or innocent travelers at Lod airport by terrorists. When he
                            objected use of word terrorists, replied that whatever one might call
                            them, the objective political fact was that Israelis were sensitive
                            vigorous people suffering from sense of being hemmed in. It was
                            inevitable that Israelis would in some fashion strike back in
                            retribution for acts like Lod killings. Somewhat lamely, Saqqaf asserted
                            Israelis must only retaliate with same kind of methods as those applied
                            to them.</p>
                        <p>5. Perhaps best thing Saqqaf could carry to Cairo was simple reassertion
                            of fundamentals of US position. In important public speech few days
                            earlier Secretary had reaffirmed President’s vigorous interest in Middle
                            East problem. We were not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not
                            pursuing simply a passive policy. We were not satisfied with no war, no
                            peace condition. There were regular opportunities for informal quiet
                            conversations with parties on both sides. Went over then with Saqqaf our
                            reasons for believing negotiations to achieve canal opening and interim
                            settlement are best way to begin. Stressed our belief imposed settlement
                            not possible and that there no such thing as US pressure on Israel which
                            with simple <pb facs="0333" n="298" xml:id="pg_298"/> pull of a lever
                            might settle whole thing. (Saqqaf scoffed when I implied US pressure on
                            Israel might not be effective.)</p>
                        <p>6. Canal opening Saqqaf thought would leave Jordan and Syria in lurch as
                            world’s interest might wane once canal operating again. I thought his
                            misgivings in this respect were exaggerated: Cease-fire of summer 1970
                            had opened way towards creation of interim solution proposals which, if
                            nothing else, provided clear definition of the nature of the problem,
                            particularly as reiterated in Secretary’s remarks toward end of 1971
                            ennumerating six most important aspects. In similar fashion interim
                            solution would keep up the momentum and open way for further progress on
                            other matters. One could not minimize Golan Heights and Jerusalem issues
                            but in last two or three years world had been undertaking by negotiation
                            solve equally tough ones, in Viet-nam, between two Koreas, in arms
                            limitation talks. If other widely differing parties negotiated, why
                            could not Arabs and Israelis? Saqqaf insisted M.E. problem was uniquely
                            difficult and tragic as compared to other disputes.</p>
                        <p>7. He closed by asking whether I could not by request to Washington
                            obtain for him some more helpful assertions of US policy which he could
                            put forward at Cairo. Declared I had tried accent our current hopes and
                            views but that in day and a half before his departure I thought there
                            little chance I could provide him any new angles. Saqqaf discussed
                            pipeline break briefly and professed find this incident, carried out
                            Saudis now think by Iraqi saboteurs, as evidence mounting displeasure
                            other Arabs with moderate Saudi policies and its friendship for US.
                            (Saudi-Iraq relations are in cool phase at moment.)</p>
                        <p>Comment: As Dept aware, the “embarrassment” and “pressure” which Saudis
                            feel from other Arabs because of their friendship with us is frequently
                            stressed by Saqqaf and others in govt.</p>
                        <p>Much of this stems no doubt from Saqqaf’s constant exposure at high-level
                            Arab meetings where he bears brunt of loose corridor talk and official
                            innuendos. Arab penchant for negativism and fondness for criticizing
                            would make Saudi Arabia with its close ties to US natural target for
                            barbs and sarcastic comment. Not publicly combative, Saqqaf has probably
                            little relish for his defensive role. On other occasions he has waved
                            his hands and spoken of “inevitable war which Arabs must fight but will
                            probably lose.” His more reasoned and intense manner in latest
                            discussion is perhaps valid evidence of increased and more genuine
                            concern with risks for Saudi Arabia from Arab-Israel stalemate
                            dispute.</p>

                            Minister Prince Sultan. Ref: A. State 11678; B. Jidda 0309.</p>
                        <p>Summary: As he had with Saqqaf, Ambassador reviewed principal points of
                                <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> A with Sultan, stressing
                            as regards economic assistance our conviction US could make unique
                            contributions, that we wanted be certain our resources not misspent, and
                            we believed projects we would be undertaking would have tangible
                            favorable impact on Yemen economy. With regard military aid, we were
                            concerned with <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> Army’s poor
                            organization and difficulties determining precisely its needs. When
                            Sultan proposed joint US-Saudi military team study of Yemen
                            requirements, <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss> declared US believed
                            it should not become directly involved in military aid relationship for
                                <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> and mentioned possibility joint
                            Saudi-Iranian survey of <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> military
                            organization and requirements. <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                            asked about Saudi subventions to tribal leaders and refugee groups from
                            Aden, to which Sultan responded with account different forms Saudi aid
                            to Yemen, including budgetary support and project assistance. Sultan
                            stated aid to Adeni groups substantially cut off and none for tribal
                            Sheikhs since end of Yemeni war. <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                            left with Sultan same informal memos of his comments as he had with
                            Saqqaf. Sultan’s reaction positive and appreciative, though his
                            questions reflected hopes for greater US involvement in <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>. Subsidies for tribes may have been
                            reduced but we suspect they still continue. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. Sultan told me Saqqaf had mentioned to him briefly our talk regarding
                            US aid to Yemen (ref B) and said he would very much welcome my giving
                            him full account also. Accordingly in much same manner as I had done for
                            Saqqaf I gave Sultan our analysis of present situation in two Yemens, of
                            their respective weaknesses and our conviction that <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> should be made to bear blame if
                            there is failure of unity talks.</p>
                        <pb facs="0335" n="300" xml:id="pg_300"/>
                        <p>2. In describing plans for US economic aid for <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> stressed that we were supplying those things which we
                            were uniquely qualified to provide—high quality technical assistance and
                            food. We were anxious our projects be well thought out and successful.
                            Much money had been wasted in Yemen and we did not wish to have our
                            resources misspent. We thought our projects would have tangible
                            favorable impact on Yemen economy and its development. This, as Prince
                            knew, had been our consistent policy.</p>
                        <p>3. In describing ideas for military assistance stressed our impression of
                                <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> Army’s poor organization and
                            difficulty of determining precisely what its needs may be. Covered also
                            points A, B and C of para seven <gloss target="#t_reftel_1"
                                >reftel</gloss> A.</p>
                        <p>4. Sultan echoed my comments on difficulty of assessing <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> requirements and shortcomings in Army
                            organization. He proposed a joint US-Saudi military team should engage
                            in careful study of Yemen requirements after which arms purchase orders
                            might be worked up.</p>
                        <p>5. I replied US continued believe that it should not become directly
                            involved in military aid relationship with <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss>. This was why we were suggesting Saudi Arabia act as
                            channel for US supplies. We did not wish kind of US involvement which
                            would force pace of Soviet assistance to South Yemen. In general we
                            expected that regional states would play pivotal roles in assisting
                                <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> militarily. Now that it
                            appeared Iranian-<gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> relations were
                            about to be restored to more normal footing, could not there be a joint
                            Iranian-Saudi survey of <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> military
                            needs? Sultan noted that Saudi military mission had been in Yemen but
                            had great trouble in finding out what was really required.</p>
                        <p>6. In mid-February, a high-level <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>
                            mission will be coming to Saudi Arabia, Sultan remarked, but <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> does not intend “throw open its
                            treasury” to Yemenis until it is surer of soundness of Yemeni plans.
                            After Yemeni mission has been here, Saudis might then consult with
                            Iranians on what should be done.</p>
                        <p>7. I told Sultan we were aware that tribal leaders and refugee groups
                            from Aden were constantly pressing Saudi Arabia for financial handouts.
                            If there was to be further aid to these groups in Yemen, could it not be
                            given through <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> Govt? Latter now
                            seemed to be one in which Saudi Arabia had full confidence. To pass all
                            aid through such channels would significantly stabilize and strengthen
                            new <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> regime.</p>
                        <p>8. Sultan gave then an account of different forms of Saudi aid to Yemen.
                            Budgetary support had amounted to forty million riyals in past year but
                            had now been stopped because of childish actions of Muhsin al-Ayni.
                            However Sultan said it might begin again. Project aid amounting to 50
                            million riyals for construction of hospitals and clinics was continuing
                            under direction of Saudi aid director now resident in Yemen.</p>
                        <pb facs="0336" n="301" xml:id="pg_301"/>
                        <p>9. Brought Sultan back to point by saying we had thought there were other
                            forms of aid also to bribes and Aden refugees and we wondered as to
                            future of these subventions.</p>
                        <p>10. Sultan then declared that recently all assistance to Adeni groups had
                            ceased except for office expenses to Makkawi. There seemed little reason
                            for continuing pay money “when there was no movement.” As for subsidies
                            to tribal Sheikhs those had stopped at time civil war had ended and
                            peace restored in Yemen.</p>
                        <p>11. But as to aid in general, Sultan went on, does not US feel it should
                            undertake larger and more extensive projects in Yemen, construction of
                            roads, schools, etc.?</p>
                        <p>12. I reminded <gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss> of what I had said
                            earlier: We wished to use skilled US technicians for carefully planned
                            projects that would be successful. It was not easy to spend money wisely
                            in Yemen and large expenditures did not guarantee comparable results.
                            Projects we were undertaking would, I felt, have real and favorable
                            impact on Yemen’s progress. I intended keep him fully informed of what
                            we were doing and of results we were achieving. Sultan welcomed this,
                            declaring that the more aid US could supply, the better it would be for
                            US and Yemen. I left with Sultan same informal memo of points covered
                            orally that I had given Saqqaf. (Copy being pouched to <gloss
                                target="#t_NEAARP_1">NEA/ARP</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>13. Later in conversation it was revealed that King, Sultan and some
                            other members of Cabinet would be traveling by road in leisurely fashion
                            from Jidda to Riyadh via Medina for period February 4–14. Thus we
                            suspect Saudis may ask for another postponement of meetings with
                            proposed high-level Yemeni mission.</p>
                        <p>14. Comment: Sultan’s reaction was positive and appreciative, though his
                            questions reflected hopes for greater degree of US involvement in <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> problems. I am sure he will pass on
                            informal memos to King and believe he will explain our proposals in
                            favorable manner. In my explanation I endeavored, of course, emphasize
                            unique and valuable character of US contribution to <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> economic development in order
                            counteract perennial Saudi tendency to evaluate aid solely in terms
                            financial magnitude. When specifics of economic aid program for <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> are determined I plan inform Sultan
                            and Saqqaf. With regard Sultan’s comments on subsidies for tribes and
                                <gloss target="#t_NUF_1">NUF</gloss> groups, as far as we can judge
                            from available intelligence, his reply is only partially correct, i.e.,
                            Saudis are closely controlling payments to Makkawi and <gloss
                                target="#t_NUF_1">NUF</gloss>. As to subsidies for tribes, we
                            believe there were curtailments at time peace re-established in Yemen,
                            but that Saudi payments are still being given quietly to tribal Sheikhs,
                            and perhaps other important military and civilian leaders in <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> by means of which Saudis intend
                            maintain shadowy framework of influence in North Yemen. There may be
                            some subsidies still for tribal military activities also.</p>

                        <p>1. Defense Minister Prince Sultan informed me March 12 that King
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> had approved in
                            principle Saudi Arabian purchase of modified Hawk missile system. I said
                            I was pleased to hear that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> had
                            decided on sound step for improvement of its defenses, one which <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> thoroughly approved.</p>
                        <p>2. Sultan asked whether he should communicate this decision in writing to
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> or to Raytheon directly. I said
                            I thought he could write Raytheon, and Sultan said he would do so. I
                            knew company would be prepared on short notice to move ahead with
                            discussions or negotiations in whatever manner His Highness might
                            desire. Sultan noted that his son, Lieutenant Prince Khalid bin Sultan
                            and another Saudi officer are now in <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                            from Arab govts to <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> as means

                            terrorists will be emboldened to ask more and more of moderate Arab

                            significance for US-Saudi relations. King said Saudi Arabia much opposed
                            to terrorism, though elements of <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1"
                                >Fatah</gloss> infiltrated by Communists and Zionists were primarily

                            cleanse itself of bad ideas and practices. King had clear reservations,

                            force Israel to do so by cutting off its support. <gloss

                                target="#t_BSO_1">BSO</gloss> conspiracy was not to erase any slight
                            progress toward Middle East peace, i.e., Khartoum assassinations may
                            well have been aimed at dissipating hopeful reaction stimulated by
                            recent talks in Washington with <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName>, Ismail and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG_1"
                                >Meir</persName>. Terrorists were seizing initiative, blackening
                            Arab image throughout world, seriously damaging Palestinian cause.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was aware that some Arab govts
                            were helping al-<gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss>, voluntarily
                            and involuntarily. Several are contributing money in sizable amounts.
                            Cutting off this money would have two important favorable results:
                            First, <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> would be pinched in all
                            its activities by reduced resources; secondly, and more important, it
                            would suffer psychologically and in prestige from knowledge that it no
                            longer enjoyed confidence and support of moderate Arab govts.</p>
                        <p>5. Finally, I told King that it seemed to me that if <gloss
                                target="#t_BSO_1">BSO</gloss> continues its activities, trend toward
                            radicalization of whole Palestinian movement will be accelerated and
                            terrorists will be emboldened to ask more and more of moderate Arab
                            govts, threatening to turn their increasingly violent tactics against
                            these govts and their leaders. My govt wished His Majesty understand we
                            regarded issue of support for <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss>
                            as one of great urgency and as having real significance for relations
                            between US and Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>6. King replied he wanted me know that Saudi Arabia very much opposed to
                            kind of violent excesses which had occurred at Khartoum. However, not
                            entire <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> organization favored
                            this kind of deplorable tactic. Regrettably there had been elements in
                                <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> infiltrated by Communists
                            and Zionists who undertook these things. Communists, for example, were
                            ones who had forged Saudi passports and given them to <gloss
                                target="#t_BSO_1">BSO</gloss> members. King reiterated firmly. “We
                            disagree with and do not support at all terrorism and extremism.”</p>
                        <p>7. King continued that Saudi Arabia was undertaking talks with <gloss
                                target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> leaders. Saudi Arabia has stopped
                            all aid to <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> and would continue
                            do so until assurances received that <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1"
                                >Fatah</gloss> would cleanse itself of bad ideas and practices. But
                            if Saudi Arabia were publicly to announce its intention stop all aid to
                                <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss>, “our Palestinian brothers
                            would attack us with much bitterness.” Moreover, <gloss
                                target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> itself would simply turn to other,
                            Communist sources for support if Saudi help permanently withdrawn.</p>
                        <pb facs="0340" n="305" xml:id="pg_305"/>
                        <p>8. Our US friends, King went on, must begin to put real pressure on
                            Israel to withdraw from Arab territories which it occupies. Once there
                            is progress in that direction, then way will be opened to resolving all
                            problems of area, including that of terrorism. On other hand, King said,
                            Jews were, of course, delighted with White House spokesman statements
                            made at end of Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG_1">Meir</persName>’s visit
                            to effect that, “US would never stop its support for Israel.”
                            Declarations of this kind greatly limit Saudi capability for influencing
                            Palestinians toward policies of moderation. As long as Israel remains so
                            stubborn things are liable become steadily worse. If Israelis will
                            withdraw from wrongfully occupied territories, then Arabs can work out
                            details of reasonable method of living with Israel. US can easily force
                            Israel to withdraw by cutting off its generous support to Israeli
                            Govt.</p>
                        <p>9. Told King I knew he was aware from text of President’s recent letter
                            to him that US continues regard Middle East question as one of most
                            important issues affecting world peace. We were not at all satisfied
                            with present no war, no peace situation. We did not believe, however,
                            that outside powers could pressure either Egypt or Israel to accept an
                            imposed solution. US was prepared help with negotiations once they were
                            under way. But only then would it become apparent to US what it was it
                            could usefully apply its pressure toward achieving.</p>
                        <p>10. Referring again to Arab govts’ support for <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1"
                                >Fatah</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_BSO_1">BSO</gloss>, I wondered
                            how moderate ones like Saudi Arabia could go on helping an organization
                            if it had indeed been infiltrated by Zionists and Communists. Saudi
                            Arabia in past had pursued policy of trying influence <gloss
                                target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> toward policies of moderation and
                            compromise. Result has been further involvement of <gloss
                                target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> with terrorists. I was certain
                                <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_BSO_1">BSO</gloss> radicalism would continue to expand
                            unless govts like Saudi Arabia took clear, determined public stand
                            against them. Prestige of such highly respected, influential figure as
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> if brought to bear
                            against terrorists could have great influence in deterring them. There
                            was perhaps some risk against taking firm short-run stand against <gloss
                                target="#t_BSO_1">BSO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1"
                                >Fatah</gloss>, but in long run moderate Arab states could in this
                            manner best forestall possibility terrorism being turned against them. I
                            reiterated that US regarded this issue as one of great seriousness in
                            bilateral relations between our two govts.</p>
                        <p>11. King responded by declaring Saudi Arabia was not against <gloss
                                target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> carrying on “normal activities”
                            aimed at Israel. Moreover, if Saudi Arabia were finally to announce
                            intention never to assist <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss>
                            again, it would simply drive Palestinians further into hands of
                            Communists and other radicals. However, King would wish me to understand
                            that Saudi Arabia’s assistance to <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1"
                                >Fatah</gloss> would remain stopped until, “they come to a right
                            line.”</p>
                        <p>12. I said my govt believed it extremely important that Saudi Arabia use
                            every means to bring pressure on al-<gloss target="#t_Fatah_1"
                                >Fatah</gloss> to abandon its support <pb facs="0341" n="306"
                                xml:id="pg_306"/> of terrorists. King replied that Saudi Arabia
                            thought it very important US use all its influence to press Israel to
                            withdraw from occupied Arab territories.</p>
                        <p>13. Comment: King remained calm and relaxed throughout interview. He
                            seemed almost to expect firmness and frankness of US viewpoint given to
                            him. At same time he equally firm in holding to present Saudi policy of
                            carefully limiting Saudi aid to <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss>
                            but not closing off all contacts by emphatic or public disavowals.
                            Saudis plainly worried about Communist (and Zionist) influence in <gloss
                                target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> and we have no doubt they detest
                            and are fearful of terrorism. Nevertheless it also true that their
                            convictions as to Israelis’ stubborness and US unwillingness pressure
                            Israel are clearly identified in their minds as root causes of
                            terrorism.</p>

                            on probable next step. Ambassador said that while he lacked specific

                                >Abdullah</persName> has moved seems favorable omen reflecting

                            issues directly to King for immediate decisions, bypassing many of usual
                            bureaucratic obstacles inherent in Council of Ministers’ consideration
                            etc. Hope <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> can reciprocate with
                            comparable promptness in authorizing US to present project team letter

                        <p>In preparing letter suggest it be drawn to cover expenses for perhaps two
                            to two and a half year period and that we be given if possible
                            description in outline of team’s purpose, how it will operate, etc., to
                            present to <persName corresp="#p_AS_1">Abdullah</persName> with letter
                            of offer. As in case of <gloss target="#t_USN_1">USN</gloss> team
                            designated for Saudi Navy project, there might be advantage in drawing
                            up <gloss target="#t_SANG_1">SANG</gloss> project group so that it could
                            undertake many functions such as contracting, recruitment, preparation
                            of specifications etc., which might otherwise have to be undertaken by
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> or US Army offices dealing with
                            these matters. Prince <persName corresp="#p_AS_1">Abdullah</persName>
                            will, we believe, be eagerly awaiting arrival of first US “advisors” in
                            Saudi Arabia. In interest of continuity and effectiveness we would
                            suggest careful consideration be given to possibility assigning
                            personnel for accompanied tours of two years or more. <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> might wish think also about
                            possibility including eventually among those assigned to Saudi Arabia
                            two or three young Arabists, military or civilian, to act as
                            interpreters, expediters, government relations men. Project and

                        <p>Summary: Efforts to manipulate our relations with Saudis in order oppose
                            terrorist threat should focus on (a) cooperation in [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] public security spheres
                            where we believe something of real value can be accomplished, and (b) in
                            political dialogue aimed at highlighting Fedayeen threat and diminishing
                            their respectability. In latter area, however, we must expect Saudis
                            assume their customary cautious posture, avoiding positions that could
                            lead to confrontation with Fedayeen or stimulate active hostility of
                            radical Arab states. Unfortunately Saudis will probably continue regard
                            some minimal levels of support to <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1"
                                >Fatah</gloss> as kind of “insurance premium”, though disenchantment
                            with <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> is in many respects real,
                            and financial and other forms of assistance have fallen to fraction of
                            what they were in former years. Accordingly, we intend continue patient
                            educational process seeking reinforce growing disillusion with <gloss
                                target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss>. At same time we share colleagues’
                            views on indispensibility getting at root cause: continuance of
                            Arab-Israel dispute. Publicly Saudis have abjured use of oil as
                            political weapon, but there are insistent pressures on them to do
                            otherwise. We suggest consideration of steps which can offset present
                            overwhelming pro-Israel appearance of US policy in Arab eyes. Saudis at
                            least almost pathetically eager for signs <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> support of some aspects of Arab side of case. We agree
                            US needs strengthen position of moderate Palestinians perhaps with
                            greater attention to plight of refugees and by examining means providing
                            Palestinians with respectable political entity and political personality
                            of their own. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. An assessment of how we can manipulate our relations with Saudi Arabia
                            to bring about some abatement of terrorist threat divides itself fairly
                            obviously into two broad topics: (a) cooperation in [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] apprehension of dangerous
                            personages; (b) dialogue on political level intended bring weight of
                            Saudi influence and that of King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> personally to discourage terrorist
                            activities.</p>
                        <pb facs="0344" n="309" xml:id="pg_309"/>
                        <p>2. With regard to first category, Saudi attitudes reveal fertile sphere
                            for cooperation. Aside from recent Tapline sabotage on Saudi territory
                            and rupture of Aramco piping some distance inland few weeks ago, Saudis
                            have been for past three years blissfully immune from disruptive impact
                            of bombings, assassinations and other turmoil which has gripped Jordan,
                            Lebanon, and even occasionally Kuwait. Saudis are desperately anxious
                            preserve this happy state of affairs. Urgent hope that wolf will stay
                            away from their door has even made Saudis blind to fact that they too
                            were one of <gloss target="#t_BSO_1">BSO</gloss>’s targets in Khartoum.
                            Comments here have revealed almost no spontaneous recognition of this
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>]. Saudi security
                            services are hardly paragons of modernity, but they have some factors
                            going for them. We in process of preparing assessment role and future
                            potential of Palestinians in Saudi Arabia (estimated around 30,000). Our
                            preliminary estimate is this community cowed and uneasy, aware that
                            significant terrorist disturbance could easily result in couple of
                            thousand of them finding themselves in jail within two or three days.
                                <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> has no overt operating
                            offices in Saudi Arabia. Suspicion directed toward them, and relative
                            isolation of Palestinians here tends reduce numbers who would be
                            inclined harbor or assist <gloss target="#t_BSO_1">BSO</gloss> teams.
                            One senior Saudi has remarked to us, with perhaps a bit too much
                            confidence, that Khartoum incident most unlikely occur here since
                            without doubt assassins’ heads would roll (literally) within few days
                            after event. Draconian, Saudi-style justice has it strengths.</p>
                        <p>4. Our <gloss target="#t_AIDOPS_1">AID/OPS</gloss> mission (internal
                            security advisers) in Riyadh is remarkably well placed encourage and
                            assist Saudis undertake perhaps most useful task they can pursue in
                            combatting terrorism: denial of Saudi territory to <gloss

                            opportunities build up Saudi surveillance capabilities (including,
                            hopefully, improving its targeting). For example, Deputy Minister
                            Interior Mohammed bin Zara will be in US for several weeks. Orientation

                            six top quality, young, English-speaking Saudi security officers for
                            courses in bomb disposal and other anti-terrorist techniques. We
                            informed bin Zara looking for immigration control adviser. His visit
                            should provide opportunity review Saudi terrorist control techniques,
                            and, without driving points home too hard, suggest means for improvement
                            with which we might perhaps assist. We also in process improving quality
                            of advisers for Coast Guard/Frontier Force. Obviously we cannot be too
                            sanguine about prospects sealing long Saudi frontiers or establishing
                            fully effective controls at points of entry, but we have at least
                            considerable Saudi desire for <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            assistance and for advice on wide range these preventive endeavors.</p>
                        <p>5. Before reviewing problem of Fedayeen terror in Saudi-US bilateral
                            terms, we would like reinforce feelings expressed by neighboring <pb
                                facs="0345" n="310" xml:id="pg_310"/> colleagues that there is
                            probably no real cure for terrorist disease other than getting at
                            underlying cause: Arab-Israeli dispute. We may be tempted regard present
                            situation as kind of <hi rend="italic">pax Judaca</hi> which, like <hi
                                rend="italic">pax Romana</hi> of centuries past, seems represent
                            triumph of highly organized, motivated and intelligent minority over
                            surrounding majority in Eastern Mediterranean. In that sense it is not
                            perhaps an unusual historical phenomenon. Judging from stand-pat
                            statements emanating now from Israeli leaders, this state of affairs is
                            viewed by some of them with considerable satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>6. But to US and Arabs such “pax” seems hardly as enduring and
                            satisfactory as it may to our Israeli friends. Dragon’s teeth, such as
                            terrorism, keep sprouting up all round the edges. We know that “no
                            peace, no war” is still fraught with risks for us, if not for Israeli,
                            interests. We have felt reassured by various Saudi public statements
                            abjuring use of petroleum as political weapon and by affirmations of
                            Saudi sense of responsibility for making its oil available to Western
                            users. But it might be a mistake to regard these affirmations as having
                            indefinite durability. We know there are insistent pressures on Saudi
                            Arabia from other Arab states to examine more intensively how oil could
                            be brought to bear to influence Western, and particularly US, attitudes
                            on Arab-Israel issue, and there is evidence of similar pressure from
                            Fedayeen quarters as well.</p>
                        <p>7. Important conviction affecting Arab outlook on every phase of problem
                            is mounting Arab feeling, quite unintended perhaps on our part, that
                            single overriding <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> interest in
                            Middle East is support of Israel. As we have seen in re-[garble] Arabs
                            have reached stage where they give instant credence to “announcements”
                            from whatever source describing increased US assistance for Israel.</p>
                        <p>8. As usual, statement of problem is easier than formulation of solution.
                            Yet we wonder if there is not something we can do to balance the seeming
                            pro-Israeli cast of our present policy by efforts to convince Arabs we
                            are well disposed toward them also. Saudis, at least, are almost
                            pathetically eager for signs that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            supports some aspects of Arab side of case. Friendly reception given
                            here to our recent public statement on status of Jerusalem is
                            significant case in point (Jidda 0318).</p>
                        <p>9. We share fully Kuwait’s view (Kuwait 0929) suggesting <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should take closer look at its
                            relations with moderate Palestinians. We not fully up to date here on
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy toward <gloss
                                target="#t_UNRWA_1">UNRWA</gloss>, but it is our impression we have
                            in recent years devoted much effort to impressing clearly on other
                            states notion that they must now assume increasing percentage of <gloss
                                target="#t_UNRWA_1">UNRWA</gloss>’s financial burden. Even with
                            present tightness of aid funds, we wonder if it would not be possible
                            somehow demonstrate more positive concern for Palestinian refugee
                            plight. Congress seems respond well to humanitarian pleas for assisting
                            destitute mil<pb facs="0346" n="311" xml:id="pg_311"/>lions in
                            Bangladesh or oppressed Jews in Soviet Union. Is there any way plight of
                            Palestinians might again be made more vivid to our legislators even
                            though it involves difficult task separating terrorist image from that
                            of Palestinians as whole?</p>
                        <p>10. Ultimately we must seek to isolate and undermine terrorisms and
                            commandos by establishing another, more stable and respectable
                            Palestinian political entity and political personality—an objective that
                            can perhaps be achieved in one of forms proposed by King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> and by drawing on Palestinian
                            leadership from East Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza. Once established in
                            a recognized political framework of their own, moderate Palestinians
                            could soon repudiate and undermine both the appeal and the threat of
                            Fedayeen.</p>
                        <p>11. If <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> prepared cooperate quietly
                            but broadly [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>],
                            political collaboration is obviously far more complex issue. Saudi
                            policy in world as well as Arab affairs follows well established
                            principles and guidelines. Currently Saudi friendship for US and their
                            anti-Communism are strong and consistent. They do not assure us of their
                            friendship privately and next day mount hustings to condemn us. But in
                            general they do not mount hustings at all, i.e., policy statements made
                            in public are abjured except where circumstances such as presence of
                            distinguished visitors require standard voicing of generally meaningless
                            Arab rhetoric. This standard Saudi low-profile technique dictates, for
                            example, policy of no response to Baghdad Radio’s recurrent anti-Saudi
                            invective or to glancing blows from Libyan spokesmen when latter
                            identify reactionary royal regimes as Arab enemies. For a territorially
                            vast, militarily very weak and very rich country, this policy has paid
                            off remarkably well over last three years, a period in which Saudis have
                            seen marked improvement in their relations with Yemen, Syria, Egypt,
                            Sudan and Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>12. Yet in many respects and aside from Islamic affairs, Saudis are still
                            fundamentally timorous, aware that their friendship for US, on which
                            they depend heavily to strengthen them against radical threats from
                            South Yemen and Iraq, leaves them in highly vulnerable position
                            vis-à-vis many of their Arab brethren to extent that they might with few
                            missteps become prime target of such Arab radicals as Algieria, Libya,
                            Iraq and Syria.</p>
                        <p>13. Following these principles Saudis have tended manage their relations
                            with <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> and other militant
                            Palestinian groups in gingerly fashion. In immediate post-’67 years
                            Saudi Govt’s public endorsement of Palestinian commandos matched
                            enthusiasm of other Arab States. Similarly decline in Saudi support has
                            tended follow that of other Arab govts as movement became steadily more
                            fragmented, less effective, and more discredited. [<hi rend="italic">2

                            factionalism and is deeply disturbed by Khartoum type terrorism.</p>
                        <p>14. However, Saudi attitudes towards <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1"
                                >Fatah</gloss> will, we think, continue to be influenced
                            fundamentally by typical cast of Saudi thinking described above.
                            Payments to <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> will probably
                            continue at levels carefully aimed at keeping in force present
                            “insurance policy” against instigation of terrorism and sabotage within
                            Saudi borders. Perhaps we should keep in mind that the more we warn
                            against growing identity of <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_BSO_1">BSO</gloss>, the more we risk strengthening
                            Saudi conviction that some minimal level of insurance premiums must be
                            maintained. Insurance policy has had incidental benefits for us too,
                            i.e., vital oil installations have been immune from serious disruptions,
                            official US personnel and premises (such as our far-flung military
                            mission located at four major sites) have been free even of any signs of
                            intimidation.</p>
                        <p>15. On balance, however, we strongly favor continued steady dialogue
                            keeping Saudis fully reminded close <gloss target="#t_BSO_1"
                                >BSO</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> links,
                            long-range dangers of expansion in terrorist scope and in general doing

                            disreputable image in Saudi minds. In this way we can hope minimize

                            he would apparently like believe, i.e., that there are still within
                            organization good and bad elements and that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> can reasonably hope make influence of former
                            predominant. Ongoing educational process we have in mind is best served
                            through reiterated low-pitch discussions with key officials, rather than
                            repeated formal démarches. Proposed tactic requires steady supply of
                            incriminating intelligence tending prove <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1"
                                >Fatah</gloss>’s close involvement in terrorist activities.</p>
                        <p>16. By such tactics we can hope, at least, assure there is growing
                            disenchantment with <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> and no
                            increase in Saudi support for it. It is unrealistic, however, hope
                            Saudis, who in crucial Middle East affairs are [garble—chronic?]
                            followers and not leaders, will suddenly assume dramatic new posture cut
                                <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> off forever without cent
                            and follow Jordan in making emphatic public condemnations. We may be
                            convinced ourselves that radicalism-terrorism can increase its sway
                            among Arabs to point where conservative regimes like <gloss

                        <p>1. We are concerned at indications provided reftels that Saudis are
                            seemingly reluctant to enter into frank dialogue with Iranians on
                            peninsular security matters. Granted that King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>, for political as well as
                            personal reasons, may not wish to take any initiatives to arrange for
                            transfer of Iranian-owned F–5 munitions to Saudi Arabia. Still, this
                            would appear be shift in Saudi policy position in as much as precedent
                            for such transfer was established by loan to Saudi Arabian Army of
                            Iranian 106 mm recoilless rifles and anti-aircraft guns several years
                            ago. Failure of Saudis to discuss peninsular security questions with
                            Iranians moreover strikes us as step backward from basis for frank
                            dialogue seemingly laid at time of Saqqaf visit to Tehran last
                            December.</p>
                        <p>2. Recurring hints from various sources that Saudis are disturbed in some
                            way by presence of Iranian special forces and helicopters in Oman, as
                            well as Iran’s hesitation [mentioned by Khalatbary] to provide military
                            support for Yemen lest it upset the Arabs point to need for early and
                            frank discussions between Riyadh and Tehran about their respective roles
                            and activities in supporting peninsula states threatened by <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> aggression/subversion. Such
                            consultation need not be in context of drawing up “security treaty” or
                            other formal alliance but should instead focus on assuring that each
                            side is aware of what other is intending to do to help in order that
                            competition or overlapping can be avoided. If Saudis are in fact uneasy
                            about Iranian military assistance initiatives in Oman or Yemen, then
                            they would be well advised to let Iranians know what they themselves are
                            planning to do and suggest ways in which Iranians can be helpful in
                            supporting Saudi effort. If <pb facs="0349" n="314" xml:id="pg_314"/>
                            Saudis choose to leave Iranians in dark about their aid programs and
                            intentions in <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> and Oman, result
                            could be that Iranians will act without consulting Saudis. Not only does
                            this risk wasteful duplication of effort but it could serve further to
                            increase any suspicions Saudis may have that Iran intends play lone hand
                            in peninsula and Gulf.</p>
                        <p>3. Our policy is to continue encourage both Saudis and Iranians to assume
                            primary responsibility for regional security. Accordingly, we do not
                            believe that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should substitute
                            itself in role of middleman between Tehran and Riyadh, whether purpose
                            is to arrange transfer of military material or to supply information on
                            each other’s military assistance programs to third countries. To do so
                            merely invites continuing recourse to this tactic by either side and
                            vitiates our policy of stimulating greater regional cooperation and
                            self-reliance. Instead, we consider <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            efforts should most usefully be employed in pressing both sides, and
                            especially Saudis, in getting on with developing kind of dialogue with
                            each other that would genuinely facilitate meaningful coordinated
                            planning of assistance to other peninsular states.</p>
                        <p>4. For Jidda. We look forward to receiving your thoughts on how direct
                            Iranian-Saudi dialogue could be encouraged. At your discretion, you may
                            also wish to discuss points raised Tehran <gloss target="#t_reftel_1"
                                >reftel</gloss> and para 1–3 above with Saqqaf prior to your
                            departure for COM conference. Since Saqqaf [next perhaps to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK_1">Kamal Adham</persName>] has been senior Saudi
                            official most closely involved in Saudi coordination with Iran on
                            security matters, it would be useful to have his views on how Saudis see
                            question of coordination and cooperation with Iran developing.</p>
                        <p>5. For Tehran. Suggest you inform Khalatbary that we ourselves do not
                            possess full information on Saudi assistance to Oman and Yemen. You
                            could add that we too believe more consultation between Saudi Arabia and
                            Iran is required and that we have requested Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TN_1">Thacher</persName> to give some consideration
                            prior his visiting Tehran to how Saudis might be encouraged to be more
                            forthcoming with Iranians on military assistance issues.</p>

                        <p>The period began with the Saudi Arabian Government’s efforts concentrated
                            on the largest Hajj in history, which included an increase of more than
                            one-third in foreign pilgrims over last year.</p>
                        <p>High-ranking visitors to Saudi Arabia during the first quarter of 1973
                            included President Franjieh of Lebanon, the Italian Foreign Minister,
                            the Kuwaiti Defense Minister (performing the Hajj), a Syrian Deputy
                            Prime Minister, former <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Secretary of
                            Defense <persName corresp="#p_MR_1">McNamara</persName> in his capacity
                            as <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss> head, and Prime Minister
                            Al-Hajri of Yemen accompanied by a full retinue from his government. On
                            the other hand, many of the leading members of the Saudi hierarchy,
                            including Princes Sultan and <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>, and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Saqqaf,
                            were away during a good part of the period.</p>
                        <p>The Black September operation against the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum
                            dominated events of the second half of the period. Following outspoken
                            criticism by Saqqaf of the perpetrators of the crime, a high-ranking
                                <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> member, Abu Hisham, visited
                            Riyadh, saw the King and reported all as being well between the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_Fatah_1"
                                >Fatah</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The period closed in a renewed state of instability, as the Saudis were
                            attacked—by design or by error—by two <gloss target="#t_MiG_1"
                                >MIGs</gloss> at a desert outpost along the South Yemeni border only
                            a few days after an incursion by Iraq against <gloss target="#t_SA_1"
                                >SA</gloss>’s northern neighbor Kuwait. Although there was no
                            confirmation of reports of Saudi-Iraqi clashes along their lengthy
                            border or of Saudis massing troops there, the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> was clearly troubled by this new evidence of Iraqi
                            radical activism.</p>
                        <pb facs="0351" n="316" xml:id="pg_316"/>
                        <p>The fourth meeting of the Islamic Foreign Ministers’ Conference in
                            Benghazi, coming in the midst of these other clearly more important
                            events, passed almost unnoticed.</p>
                        <p>Beginning the year as a 25-percent owner of <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO_1"
                                >ARAMCO</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> continued
                            to receive increasing royalties from their ever-growing oil production.
                            Nearly eight million barrels a day are now being produced, and reserves
                            are piling up at approximately $130 million a month.</p>
                        <p>Concluding a chapter in Saudi-US relations that began over a year ago,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TN_1">Thacher</persName> and Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_AS_1">Abdullah</persName> signed an <gloss

                                target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss>, and the Khartoum Incident</p>
                        <p>Towards the end of January, Tapline was ruptured at two separate points
                            on successive nights by what was clearly sabotage. Action of the Saudi
                            security forces, once they were forced to concede sabotage was involved,
                            seemed primarily aimed at exonerating themselves of any blame for the
                            affair: no one was ever apprehended, nor was it ever decided who had
                            carried out the sabotage. At the time, however, there was speculation—in
                            view of the apparent reduction in the Saudi subsidy to <gloss
                                target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> and the recently-concluded
                            participation agreement—that the fedayeen (perhaps operating from Iraq)
                            were showing Saudi Arabia it was no longer off limits.</p>
                        <p>In any case, regardless of who was responsible for the Tapline sabotage,
                            the lack of inviolability of Saudi Arabia from organized fedayeen
                            operations was firmly driven home by the Black September/<gloss
                                target="#t_Fatah_1">Fatah</gloss> operation launched against the
                            Saudi Embassy in Khartoum on March 1.</p>
                        <p>The Saudis clearly were shocked by the operation, and privately members
                            of the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> expressed strong indignation
                            over the murders of the two American and the Belgian diplomats. Coming
                            as it did so shortly after the Israelis shot down the Libyan passenger
                            plane over Sinai, many Saudis concluded that the operation must have
                            been planned by Israeli agents who had infiltrated the Black September
                            organization. Publicly, however, there was no official reaction for
                            several days. Then Saqqaf denounced the operation as “evil and bad”, and
                            the perpetrators as misdirected. This denunciation was followed by a
                            visit to Riyadh by one of the higher-ranking members of <gloss

                        <p>In subsequent discussions between the Ambassador and Saqqaf, the Saudis

                                >Fatah</gloss>; Saqqaf prefers instead to suggest that various

                            disrupted by an incident March 22 in which two MIGs strafed the Saudi
                            outpost of Wuda’iah, between Shururah and the South Yemeni border.
                            Although the motive behind this attack is somewhat obscure—there was
                            speculation that it may conceivably have been an error—as it occurred
                            within two days of Iraq’s clearly-planned attack against the northern
                            border of Kuwait, there has been speculation by Saudis of coordination
                            between Aden and Baghdad. At any rate, as a result of these two
                            incidents and the Khartoum killings, the line between the various
                            conservative regimes of the area and the “progressive” ones—a line that
                            Saudi Arabia has attempted, and since Nasser’s death somewhat
                            successfully, to blur—is once again being more clearly delineated.</p>

                            the five participants in <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO_1">ARAMCO</gloss>. The
                            satisfactory conclusion of oil agreements between the Iraqis and <gloss

                            to ask for even more from <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO_1">ARAMCO</gloss>. In
                            a press conference and in public meetings during the period, however,
                                <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> continued to support
                            participation, as opposed to nationalization, and gave excellent and
                            convincing reasons why Saudi Arabia had achieved the best deal for
                            itself for the present time. At the same time <persName
                                corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> seemed quite concerned with
                            rumored groupings of oil-consumer countries, which he said could lead to
                            an economic “war.”</p>
                        <p>Oil production continued to rise and was approaching eight million
                            barrels a day by the end of the period. This continuing dramatic <pb
                                facs="0353" n="318" xml:id="pg_318"/> increase, coupled with the
                            10-percent loss through devaluation of the Kingdom’s dollar reserves,
                            may in time precipitate an intensification of the debate between
                            advocates of removing the oil as fast as possible, and those who would
                            prefer to let production level off at some as yet unannounced figure.
                            The supporters of a slowdown have been more vocal in recent months.
                            Their major arguing point is that the Kingdom will be unable to spend
                            the vast amounts of money it will earn in production of 20 or more
                            million barrels a day, and it would be better to leave the oil in the
                            ground until such time as the money it produced could be spent. At the
                            same time, and as part of this debate, <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1"
                                >Yamani</persName> continued to stress that his desire for
                            downstream investments, which had been expressed publicly last fall in
                            New York, was only in order to protect Saudi marketing of its own oil;
                            that to the fullest extent Saudi Arabia intends to use its oil money to
                            reinvest in the Kingdom and thus develop its own industrial base.</p>
                        <p>Foreign and American bankers continued to visit Saudi Arabia in great
                            numbers and hold talks with oil and monetary officials with regard to
                            the future of Saudi investments. But no decisions were made, and it is
                            apparent that Saudi Arabia will continue in the immediate future to play
                            the conservative investment game it has so far. In this connection,
                            reports that Saudi Arabia had moved vast quantities of dollars during
                            the weeks preceding devaluation were vigorously denied by Governor Anwar
                            Ali; in point of fact, considering the conservative nature of Saudi
                            investments and the lack of sophisticated communications necessary to
                            move money fast, Ali’s denial was certainly correct. In any case, the
                            question of future Saudi oil and investment policy remains unanswered,
                            and one can only conclude from a preliminary review of the situation as
                            it exists today that a key factor in convincing the Saudis to produce
                            the quantities of oil the United States and Western Europe would like is
                            to convince them that they will be able to invest the money productively
                            in their own country.</p>

                            The agreement, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, clarifies

                            provide to modernize the Saudi National Guard. Although there were no
                            references made to the time period for the modernization, it is clear
                            that the relationship will probably extend for the rest of the decade
                            and longer. Actual work on the program will not begin until later this

                            conclusion. In the future, the Embassy anticipates some disagreements

                            <salute>Dear George:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I know that <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Bill Simon</persName> has told
                            you about the discussion he and <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Bill
                                Casey</persName> had at luncheon over here with the Saudi Oil
                            Minister, <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName>, and his
                            associate Prince Saud. The Saudis had told me before lunch that to
                            justify their increasing their production in oil, they would have to
                            find ways to usefully invest the proceeds in their own industrial
                            diversification, and other investments that contributed something to
                            their national future. I understand that at luncheon there was a broad
                            ranging discussion of their industrial development objectives,
                            possibilities of attracting petrochemical and high energy content
                            industries like aluminum, their need for technology and the ability to
                            introduce industrial products to world markets, what they should
                            consider doing in development aid beyond their neighboring Arab States,
                            what the future held for them in downstream investments in the petroleum
                            industry and in portfolio investments. The Saudis reiterated their
                            desire for guidance and assistance from the United States in these
                            matters. I think we should show enough interest in these aspirations of
                            theirs to send a very small qualified group over there to hold
                            discussions with them with a view to preliminary assessment of the
                            possibilities and exploring an approach to working with them. This would
                            be a combination of the export promotion and development assistance we
                            more or less regularly give to other countries.</p>
                        <p>I would like to see <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Bill Simon</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Bill Casey</persName>, together with no
                            more than two or three people from Commerce who have special knowledge
                            in industrial location, high energy content industrial processes,
                            petrochemicals and the like, go over and spend a few days <pb

                        <p>During your absence in Moscow, we will be asked by State and Defense to
                            make a decision in principle to sell F–4 Phantoms to Saudi Arabia and
                            Kuwait. As you know from the Daily Brief, the urgency surrounding the
                            recent Saudi requests relates to the departure of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> for a visit to France on May
                            13. The French will probably try to convince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> to purchase Mirage
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>The Saudis have asked for our agreement in principle to sell them F–4s,
                            in part as a test of the importance we attach to our relations with
                            Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Minister of Defense realizes that his air force
                            is not now ready for the F–4, but argues that after several years of
                            experience with the F–5, Saudi Arabia will be prepared to move to the
                            more sophisticated aircraft. They want to know in principle that they
                            can plan on a follow-on aircraft from the US.</p>
                        <pb facs="0357" n="322" xml:id="pg_322"/>
                        <p>The Kuwaiti interest in the F–4 is less pressing, although the Kuwaitis
                            have already been fully briefed on both the F–5 and F–4. They have
                            concluded that the F–4 is too sophisticated given their present
                            capabilities, but have declined the simpler F–5 as an alternative.
                            Reports have reached us that the Kuwaitis now intend to purchase the
                            Mirage, and to forestall such a decision we have offered them the F–8
                            Crusader (a Navy interceptor available in our inventory), as well as
                            other military equipment. One element in the Kuwaiti decision on the
                            Mirage will be our willingness to agree to sell F–4s as a follow-on to
                            the F–8. As in the case of Saudi Arabia, an agreement in principle is
                            sought now but deliveries would not take place for several years.</p>
                        <p>A number of considerations should govern whatever decision is reached on
                            these requests for F–4s:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">Advantages of Agreement.</hi> We would
                                significantly strengthen our relationship with Saudi Arabia at a
                                time when it is beginning to emerge as a significant international
                                actor because of its oil wealth and because of its role as the
                                stabilizing factor in the Arabian Peninsula. We could expect some
                                favorable reaction in other Arab countries to US willingness to
                                provide the symbolically important F–4 to Arabs as well as Israelis
                                and Iranians. There is also a commercial interest in these sales of
                                some consequence.</p>
                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">Disadvantages of Agreement.</hi> The Israelis, and
                                perhaps the Iranians, would be opposed to the supply of F–4s to
                                Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Israel would fear that the Egyptians and
                                Syrians would be allowed to familiarize themselves with the F–4,
                                thereby possibly weakening the effectiveness of the Israeli air
                                force. Both Israel and Iran might also fear that at some future date
                                Saudi or Kuwaiti F–4s might be used against them. Finally, if we
                                agree to sell F–4s to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, we can anticipate
                                that Jordan, and perhaps eventually Morocco, will also ask for
                                them.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>The choices that we have in responding to these requests are the
                            following:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—Defer a decision on F–4s for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for now,
                                pending a full review of our policy in the Arabian peninsula.</p>
                            <p>—Agree in principle to sell F–4s to Saudi Arabia, but defer a
                                decision on the Kuwaiti request.</p>
                            <p>—Agree in principle to sell F–4s to both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>An agreement in principle now would not require that we get involved in
                            numbers or delivery schedules at this point. Nor would the decision be
                            irrevocable, particularly if circumstances in the Middle East were to
                            change significantly, because deliveries would be at least three or four
                            years off.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName> will recommend approving in
                            principle for both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> strongly favors that course
                            too. Our recommendation is to approve in principle for Saudi Arabia now
                            but to hold off in Kuwait. Saudi Arabia seems solidly a US friend.
                            Although an <pb facs="0358" n="323" xml:id="pg_323"/> avowed enemy of
                            Israel, it has not shown any stomach for joining the fight. It is
                            important to us to strengthen our relationship with Saudi Arabia, and
                            some of that requires simply that we treat Saudis more like Iran and
                            Israel. Kuwait, it seems to us, is a different issue. Its policy can be
                            more quixotic, and it is more vulnerable to Arab pressures. While the US
                            is enjoying a honeymoon with Kuwait following Iraq’s attack, we feel the
                            relationship should have more time to settle before we get into the
                            F–4s.</p>

                            </list>
                            <p>King Faysal will visit Cairo on May 12 en route to Paris. His purpose
                                will be to warn President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                    >Sadat</persName> not to resume hostilities and to give the
                                United States time to begin a diplomatic initiative to break the
                                Middle East impasse. Since we have a separate message from Faysal on
                                oil, it would be very useful in strengthening his moderate position
                                if we could [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                    declassified</hi>] deliver a message to him prior to his
                                departure for Cairo.</p>
                            <p>Several issues need to be addressed:</p>
                            <p>First is a response to King Faysal’s message to the President
                                affirming Saudi friendship and the lack of any intention to use oil
                                to get us to change our policies. You will be aware of this from the
                                Daily Brief.</p>
                            <pb facs="0360" n="325" xml:id="pg_325"/>
                            <p>Second is our response to the recent Saudi request for an agreement
                                in principle to the sale of F–4s. Their request is partly a test of
                                the importance we attach to our relations with Saudi Arabia. The
                                Saudis realize that it will be several years before the F–4 can be
                                integrated into their air force, but they nonetheless are asking for
                                an agreement in principle now. The alternative for them is to
                                purchase the Mirage F–1, which the French will press on them during
                                Faysal’s visit to Paris next week.</p>
                            <p>State and Defense both recommend a positive reply to the Saudi
                                request. Possible disadvantages have been weighed—Israeli and
                                Iranian opposition, stimulation of arms races in the area, Egyptian
                                access to Saudi F–4s—but on balance these appear to be offset by the
                                obvious advantages of strengthening our relationship with Saudi
                                Arabia. If Faysal were to learn of our agreement in principle before
                                seeing <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>, he could argue
                                convincingly that the United States is not being entirely one-sided
                                in its approach to the Arab-Israeli question.</p>
                            <p>With these points in mind, we recommend [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                    declassified</hi>] deliver to Faysal before his departure for
                                Cairon on May 12 the following message:</p>
                            <quote>
                                <p>“The President greatly appreciated receiving King Faysal’s
                                    message concerning Saudi policy on oil production. Saudi
                                    Arabia’s friendship for the United States is highly valued and
                                    we look forward to a growing relationship in all areas,
                                    including oil. Shaykh Yamani’s recent talks in Washington
                                    provided us with an excellent opportunity to exchange views and
                                    we fully understand the points the Minister made. We deeply
                                    appreciate the spirit of friendship in which the Saudi concerns
                                    were conveyed.</p>
                                <p>“Before King Faysal departs for Cairo, the President would like
                                    to reassure him that a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict
                                    is of highest priority for the United States. We can offer no
                                    guarantees of a successful outcome, but we can promise to pursue
                                    the path of diplomacy with great seriousness of purpose. A peace
                                    settlement will take time and requires the development of
                                    confidence among all parties. We believe the process should
                                    begin through quiet diplomacy.</p>
                                <p>“Finally, King Faysal should know that he will soon be hearing

                                    Arabia in the years ahead to develop its strength and
                                    independence.”</p>

                            <p>Both State and Defense urge giving a similar positive response now to

                                more difficult decision because Kuwait’s foreign policy is less
                                firmly anti-Communist and is more quixotic. However, there are
                                strong arguments for moving ahead. It is important to move ahead
                                with Saudi Arabia now if we are going to make a positive decision,

                        <p>K: Hello.</p>
                        <p>R: Henry.</p>
                        <p>K: Yes, Ken.</p>
                        <p>R: What I called you about was something that to—I’m sorry to bother you
                            at the last moment, but this sale of F–4s to Kuwait is a matter of very
                            great constance to us.</p>
                        <pb facs="0362" n="327" xml:id="pg_327"/>
                        <p>K: Well, I have just had a violent complaint from the Israelis about the
                            Saudi sale.</p>
                        <p>R: I know it and—</p>
                        <p>K: And I just can’t go along until I’ve had a chance to get to the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>R: All right. What underlies this thing really Henry is the Israelis, and
                            I understand this, they are going to take a very strong stand always
                            against our selling F–4s to the Saudis or to Kuwait. But we really need
                            to sell these planes to keep the stability in that area. They can’t
                            resell them.</p>
                        <p>K: But they can use them.</p>
                        <p>R: They can use them but not against people that use them against the
                            Israelis.</p>
                        <p>K: Why not?</p>
                        <p>R: They have no intention of doing so. The Shah has told me that he is
                            developing good relationship with both Kuwait and with the Saudis. What
                            they are worried to death about is the trouble being drummed up by Yemen
                            and by the Russians in Yemen and in that general area. Now another
                            aspect of it is, and I don’t want to take too much of your time because
                            I know you are busy, but I had in all the heads of the companies doing
                            business in Libya. They are really—their backs are against the wall.
                            What Libya is going to do is knock off one by one and then leap frog
                            over to the Middle East, and the Shah has told me he does not want to
                            raise the price of oil, but that if we , then he’s got to do it at least
                            back to Libya and back and forth. And all the heads of these companies
                            say we’ve got to do something to show—to calm this emotional upsurge in
                            the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>K: But they are always wrong Ken. Every year they have another pet
                            project to calm it, and they are never right.</p>
                        <p>R: They don’t know about this, in fact that’s a very minor factor.</p>
                        <p>K: I agree with you that we should calm emotional upsurge but that’s a
                            much more complex—you see, probably we’ll approve it, almost certainly
                            we will approve it.</p>
                        <p>R: Right.</p>
                        <p>K: But I don’t see how when the Israeli Ambassador has requested to see
                            me before the President on the Saudi thing, I don’t see how we can on
                            top of it throw the Kuwait thing in without hearing it.</p>
                        <p>R: Well—</p>
                        <p>K: I’ll see him Saturday.</p>
                        <p>R: I understand. And we will hold off—I didn’t realize that he was going
                            to see you.</p>
                        <pb facs="0363" n="328" xml:id="pg_328"/>
                        <p>K: No, he’s got a letter from Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MG_1"
                                >Meir</persName> and they are absolutely steaming. Now, we of course
                            aren’t going to undo the Saudi thing and we’ll almost certainly go ahead
                            with the Kuwaiti thing</p>
                        <p>R: Right.</p>
                        <p>K: But we owe them a hearing.</p>
                        <p>R: I agreed to that. Well, we are in accord.</p>
                        <p>K: We certainly cannot do it while he’s waiting for an appointment with
                            me.</p>
                        <p>R: I certainly agree.</p>
                        <p>K: Okay.</p>
                        <p>R: We are in accord, Henry.</p>
                        <p>K: Thank you.</p>
                        <p>R: Okay.</p>

                        <p>After initial pleasantries, Governor Ali explained he was in town for
                            meetings at the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>. In response to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName>’s question, the
                            Governor said he had also had one meeting at the Treasury.</p>
                        <pb facs="0364" n="329" xml:id="pg_329"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> recalled his luncheon
                            for Oil Minister <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> and
                            Deputy Oil Minister Prince Saud last April. He had discussed with them
                            the question of how Saudi Arabia will use its growing financial
                            reserves. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> saw the
                            growth of these reserves as an opportunity to do constructive things.
                            However, it will require closer interchange between governments and
                            broader movement of goods and capital. Governor Ali agreed, expressing
                            the hope that a combination of these circumstances would be forthcoming.
                            The Governor continued, saying that he had become acutely conscious of
                            the energy problem only in the last year. The oil reserves of the
                            producing countries are a depletable resource. However, there is lots of
                            new technology available in the consuming countries of the world. Both
                            producing and consuming countries will need to help each other. This can
                            be done if people on both sides keep cool and cooperate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> observed that in the
                            long run producers and consumers must face together the fact that
                            hydrocarbon energy is a wasting resource. One good thing which the
                            President had done was to refer to the energy situation as a challenge
                            rather than a crisis. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will
                            continue to expand research and development in such areas as coal
                            gassification, tar sands, and nuclear energy. It would be in Saudi
                            Arabia’s interest to stake out now a role in development of these
                            non-hydrocarbon energy resources.</p>
                        <p>Governor Ali thought the problem is how to convert oil wealth into an
                            on-going economic base. If a country does things for itself with the
                            help of foreign institutions, at least it can expect to move in the
                            right direction in 20–25 years time.</p>
                        <p>Stressing that he had no inclination toward politics and that his remarks
                            were made only as a modest, humble man, Governor Ali said that it is
                            also necessary to look at the problem as it affects the need to find a
                            reasonable, honorable solution for the Middle East question. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> noted that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is doing what it can to facilitate a
                            peace settlement among the parties to the conflict. However, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> cannot impose a solution on the Middle
                            East. He asked how Governor Ali thought the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> might stimulate the parties toward a settlement.
                            Governor Ali said he did not know. However, he felt that if Western
                            governments made clear their acute awareness of the need for an
                            honorable settlement, it would go a long way toward improving the
                            atmosphere for economic cooperation. He felt there is residual good will
                            for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in the Arab world. The
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> needs to move now to preserve
                            friendly relations with the Arabs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> said he understood that
                            Governor Ali believes economic development of Saudi Arabia must also
                            emphasize agricultural development. Governor Ali agreed that this is
                            indeed a major challenge. He believed the Saudi Government needs to give
                            high priority to agricul<pb facs="0365" n="330" xml:id="pg_330"/>ture
                            including livestock, farming, and fishing in order to halt the flight of
                            population from rural areas into the cities. Saudi Arabia will need the
                            help of institutions like <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            universities located in regions with climates similar to Saudi Arabia’s.
                            Saudi Arabia will also need to develop export-oriented industries. The
                            Kingdom needs a more scientific survey of possibilities for industrial
                            development. It needs to cultivate the cooperation of institutions in
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> which are prepared to invest
                            technology and capital in Saudi Arabia. In turn, the Saudi Government
                            would be willing to have a firm financial stake in such institutions.
                            Governor Ali emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            private sector can and should do much to stimulate Saudi interest in
                            such projects. It cannot simply wait for the Saudi Arabian Government to
                            take such initiatives.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> said that the above
                            parallels very much our own thinking. We have been trying to identify
                            industries like petrochemicals which Saudi Arabia could go into. The
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> planned to talk further with
                            Saudi Arabia about these possibilities sometime in the summer. Governor
                            Ali indicated he thought this was a good idea. Continuing, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> wants not only to help Saudi Arabia find alternative
                            revenue producing industries but also a way in which the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> can pay for the oil it will import
                            from Saudi Arabia. He wondered if Saudi Arabia had encountered any
                            problem in contacting American firms about joint venture opportunities.
                            The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would very much like to help
                            contact firms if that is the Saudi Government’s desire.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> said he understood that
                            Governor Ali will be working with John Meyer, former Chairman of the
                            Morgan Guaranty Bank. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName>
                            knows Mr. Meyer well and considers him a first-class individual.
                            Governor Ali said that nothing has been officially announced as yet but
                            that SAMA is planning to set up a three-man financial advisory board
                            composed of Mr. Meyer and bankers from the <gloss target="#t_UK_2"
                                >UK</gloss> and Switzerland. He was also thinking of establishing a
                            specialized investment institution so long as one could be devised that
                            is consistent with Saudi tradition and mentality. This institution would
                            stay away from petroleum and petrochemical projects but would invest in
                            other industrial fields.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> said that as he sees it
                            there is a need to create new institutions to handle the flow of money.
                            We need to think very big in terms both of domestic and international
                            institutions. Governor Ali said that he is also thinking of an
                            industrial or development bank for Saudi Arabia. A Saudi agricultural
                            bank has been in existence for several years, but its operations have
                            been hampered by a dispute over the payment of interest. He hopes that
                            Saudi psychological reactions to an industrial bank would be different.
                            There is need for some institution to finance, for example, new cement
                            plants or electric power facili<pb facs="0366" n="331" xml:id="pg_331"
                            />ties. He referred to an association with Chase Manhattan Bank and the
                            Industrial Bank of Japan in this connection. However, it may be
                            necessary to rely on a number of institutions. Moreover, there is some
                            thought being given to creation of a multinational banking institution
                            among the Persian Gulf states. This, of course, would be a more modest
                            project compared to a Saudi investment institution. He added that this
                            proposal has not yet been officially discussed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> said he had been
                            thinking about possible Saudi investment in non-oil energy technology.
                            There is need for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to find ways
                            to recover the costs of its oil imports while giving to Saudi Arabia a
                            stake in the long-term energy scene. To diversify its economic
                            opportunities, Saudi Arabia needs to be more involved. The Saudis should
                            do more to support development in Africa, for example, by investment in
                            African resources. Governor Ali commented that there has been some
                            thinking about more Saudi aid to <gloss target="#t_LDC_1"
                            >LDC</gloss>’s.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> requested the Governor’s
                            thinking about the relationship between large currency reserves and
                            international monetary stability. Governor Ali said that this was one of
                            the subjects being discussed at the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1"
                            >IMF</gloss>. He felt that the concept of automatic adjustment makes no
                            sense relative to Middle East oil producers. For such producers
                            adjustment based on the rate of exchange becomes meaningless. He noted
                            favorably a recent speech by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SG_1"
                                >Shultz</persName> that the concept of automatic adjustment should
                            not apply to Middle East oil producers but that instead an investment
                            fund should be set up to absorb their surplus reserves. Governor Ali
                            said that in general he agreed with this concept. Saudi thinking, he
                            said, is along reasonable lines. He felt the press has overplayed the
                            potentially disruptive effects of the growth of Saudi Arabian currency
                            reserves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> attitude is to encourage Saudi Arabia
                            to increase its oil output by helping the Saudis find outlets for their
                            revenues through commercial, financial, and aid channels. Which
                            industrial surveys, he asked, had Saudi Arabia undertaken? Governor Ali
                            was not sure but he thought PETROMIN had done some studies on the use of
                            flared gas for petrochemicals, steel, and aluminum. As for
                            non-hydrocarbon minerals, he felt there is a need to look deeper. More
                            needs to be done in the field of mineral development. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> observed that all of those who
                            can afford to do so should be conducting surveys in all the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s. Drawing an analogy with the game of
                            marbles, he pointed out that everyone will need to gain something if
                            trade is to continue. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has
                            always cooperated in the past with Saudi Arabia and can continue to do
                            so in the future.</p>
                        <p>Governor Ali then asked how Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1"
                                >Casey</persName> saw things developing in the Persian Gulf. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName> said he did not see any
                            of the major Gulf states surrendering their independence. He did feel,
                            however, <pb facs="0367" n="332" xml:id="pg_332"/> that there would be a
                            trend towards greater cooperation among them. He asked Governor Ali how
                            he saw relationships in the oil industry developing. Will there be
                            further movement away from government-to-industry discussions on oil
                            matters to direct government-to-government dealings as the producer
                            governments assume more control over their oil resources? Governor Ali
                            said it would be hard to answer that question since the historical
                            background in each country will do much to determine how individual
                            governments reach in each situation. He could not predict how far
                            government control will spread. He felt there is a reasonable chance for
                            stability in the world oil industry but did not believe that the Geneva
                            oil pricing agreements can last. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1"
                                >Casey</persName> agreed but said that he did not see how long there
                            can continue to be constantly rising prices for oil.</p>
                        <p>As the conversation terminated, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1"
                                >Casey</persName> remarked that we are now at the point where
                            contacts between the two governments need to be made more often. Some of
                            us, he said, need to go to Saudi Arabia this summer or fall in order to
                            talk with Saudi officials about specific areas of development. Governor
                            Ali indicated he would welcome such visits.</p>

                        <p>You are aware of the proposal from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RK_1"
                                >Rush</persName> to send a mission to Saudi Arabia [Tab B]. You now
                            have a memo from <persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Peter Flanigan</persName>
                            urging that King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> be
                            invited on a visit here in late August or September instead. [Tab A].
                            The purpose of this memo is to propose an alternative to both.</p>
                        <p>I fully understand your reservations about sending a mission to Saudi
                            Arabia—especially now that Love, Simons, <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Casey</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RK_1">Rush</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName> all see themselves going. At the
                            same time, there is still a strong argument for carrying on serious
                            discussion with key Saudis about a common strategy for the area. We have
                            major interests there and every reason to try to establish a realistic
                            basis for cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Thus the issue is not whether we should have a political dialogue with
                            the Saudis—but how we can have a rational dialogue without getting
                            bogged down in <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s
                            anti-Zionist emotionalism.</p>
                        <p>Sending the kind of people who are available to Saudi Arabia to talk to
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> does not offer
                            great hope of success. We would <pb facs="0369" n="334" xml:id="pg_334"
                            /> have to supplement it with a back-channel effort in any case. Sending
                            a person who could speak authoritatively for the President would be
                            productive, but apart from you I don’t know who that would be.</p>
                        <p>Since you are the obvious one to do the job, the alternative to a mission
                            to Saudi Arabia is to find a good Saudi to talk with here. You have
                            indicated your willingness to do this with <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1"
                                >Yamani</persName>, but he is a technocraft with a limited political
                            role.</p>
                        <p>The two candidates for a visit here are Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>—Deputy Prime Minister, Interior
                            Minister and the likely successor to <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName>—and Defense Minister Sultan. Both have visited
                            and called on the President in the past four years.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> would be interested in coming to
                            the US. In addition to his broad role as Deputy Prime Minister, he is
                            also Chairman of the Supreme Petroleum Council, and he could be invited
                            in connection with the decisions Saudi Arabia is making on future oil
                            production. At the same time, he could have the necessary political
                            talks with you and the President. You will see in the first [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] reports at <hi
                                rend="italic">Tab C</hi> that <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> is complaining that the US has never as a
                            government approached him to discuss our future oil requirements.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>] <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> is the right person to talk to
                            as far as we are concerned both on oil policy and on political issues.
                            His concern is clear from the second of the [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line not declassified</hi>] reports at <hi rend="italic">Tab

                            Incidentally, you will recall that <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> and Sultan were the two the Shah mentioned as the
                            best candidates for cooperation with Iran.</p>
                        <p>A possible solution to this problem—if you wanted to invite <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>—would be [<hi rend="italic">less

                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> out informally on whether he
                            would accept an invitation and on how we should handle it with <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>. I know <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName> thinks a <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> visit would be a good idea, [<hi
                                rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>]. My own recommendation
                            would be to decide in principle that we would receive <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>The one other point you should have in mind as you make this decision is
                            that <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> will expect to see
                            the President if he comes. I am reluctant to submit a formal schedule
                            proposal to the President at this preliminary stage, but you will want
                            to consider whether you think the President would see him for 30–45
                            minutes (with interpretation) if he came.</p>
                        <p>As I said to you a week ago, there are some important points to be made
                            to the Saudis right now:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—Foremost among them is the point you make—that neither their
                                interests nor ours will be served by their becoming more intimately
                                    <pb facs="0370" n="335" xml:id="pg_335"/> involved in the
                                Arab-Israeli dispute. This requires an authoritative statement of
                                what we are trying to do.</p>
                            <p>—A second is to establish at the highest level our interest in
                                cooperating closely with the Saudis in enhancing the stability of
                                the Peninsula and Gulf. This would be a complement to your talks
                                with the Shah.</p>
                            <p>—A third is that we are ready to work with them on the economic
                                problems related to increasing oil production.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>A visit by <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> might be a good
                            way to get these points made—and also to lay to rest the idea of a
                            political mission to Saudi Arabia now. There will still be technical
                            economic issues that should be discussed, but those could be handled by
                            a lower level economic mission at the appropriate time.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">RECOMMENDATION:</hi> That you authorize me to do the
                            following:</p>

                            with <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> whether he would come

                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Tell <persName corresp="#p_FP_1">Peter Flanigan</persName> that we
                            think his idea of a visit here is a good one, but that we think it would
                            be better to have Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>

                        <p>Saudi Arabia has no economic problems in the usual sense of the term nor
                            is it likely to have any for the foreseeable future. The government is,
                            however, being confronted with the felt need to rethink its development
                            strategy to take account of the extraordinary increase <pb facs="0371"

                            and defense spending in order to conserve foreign exchange and to
                            accumulate reserves. This concern was short lived. In 1971 oil revenues,
                            boosted by expanding oil output and rising per barrel revenues, rose 69%
                            and in 1972 grew another 42%.</p>

                        <p>If present trends continue, Saudi revenues will approach $8 billion in
                            1975.</p>
                        <p>In the changing situation of the last few years the Saudis have not been
                            able to meet even their relatively modest planned spending levels,
                            particularly for economic development. A major factor has been a
                            shortage of skilled workers and managers. But more importantly the idea
                            that massive development spending was both possible and desirable had
                            not yet taken hold in Saudi decision making circles. King Faysal was
                            still concerned with the implications of rapid development on the
                            traditions and character of Saudi society.</p>
                        <p>This is now changing. The Saudis have increased their budget for the year
                            beginning this past August by almost 70% compared to last year or from
                            $3.6 billion to $6.2 billion. While actual spending is certain to fall
                            short of plans the budget clearly indicates a determination to get
                            development spending into high gear.</p>
                        <p>The Saudis can further increase their spending rapidly by concentrating
                            on capital intensive industrial projects related to petroleum, and by
                            making needed improvements in their defense capabilities. They cannot do
                            this, however, without substantial help from the industrial west and
                            especially the United States. Plans are underway to expand oil
                            production and refining capabilities and to improve the country’s
                            transport and communications facilities. Industrial plants that are to
                            be built include a petrochemical plant, a sulphur plant, the second
                            stage of a steel rolling mill, and a flour mill.</p>
                        <p>Defense spending accounts for nearly a third of the Saudi annual budget.
                            Actual spending for defense has been close to the budgeted levels,
                            reaching $800 to $850 million in 1972–73. The rapid increase in defense
                            expenditures reflects the pent up demand caused by years of limited
                            spending. In the last two years construction of land, air, and naval
                            bases has been increased, and since early 1972, Jidda has ordered <pb
                                facs="0372" n="337" xml:id="pg_337"/> almost $1.1 billion of
                            military equipment and technical assistance, mostly from the United
                            Kingdom, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and France. Large
                            follow-on orders for naval, air, and ground force materiel seem certain
                            over the next few years.</p>
                        <p>It is not possible that spending will approach the rapidly rising
                            revenues. There clearly are limits to the country’s absorptive capacity.
                            Even under the most generous assumptions, both military and development
                            spending will fall far short of revenues if production increases to 15
                            million b/d as Aramco planned only a year ago and especially if output
                            reaches 20 million b/d in 1980 as Aramco now hopes. Clearly the economic
                            incentive for the Saudis to go along with Aramco’s production plans will
                            have to involve spending outside the country. Actually we believe that
                            for some time it would be difficult for the Saudis to spend at home—even
                            with substantial US help—the revenues generated by the present level of
                            oil production.</p>

                            Prince Sultan September 17. US officials stressed that latest proposals
                            would provide <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> with a navy more
                            modern and more <pb facs="0373" n="338" xml:id="pg_338"/> effective than
                            that earlier proposed, and within financial guidelines laid down by
                            Prince. In reply, Sultan took up most of the meeting reviewing
                            grievances at what he regarded as shortcomings of US planning support
                            for <gloss target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss>; he directed that technical
                            discussions proceed between US and Saudi naval officials, and that
                            entire team meet again with him September 19. Technical discussions
                            achieved relatively little progress due to Commander <gloss
                                target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss> lack of naval expertise. At meeting
                            September 19, however, Sultan listened with interest to further outline
                            of US proposals and directed that these be compared to earlier plan and
                            any differences explained and accounted for. He refused to be drawn into
                            discussions of specific points raised by Commander Saja and urged that
                            study be completed as soon as possible for his consideration. He agreed
                            to proposal that <gloss target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss> team travel
                                <gloss target="#t_ASAP_1">ASAP</gloss> to Washington. Sultan
                            stressed his desire move quickly in finalizing Saudi naval expansion
                            program and willingness to meet with team, even during Ramadan. Embassy
                            and <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> team encouraged that

                        <p>2. Presentation acknowledged that 596 million dollar figure had only been
                            rough estimate and that is preparation had not sufficiently considered
                            extremely recent developments in weapons and technology or considerable
                            impact such developments on cost of navy proposal. Ambassador and team
                            stressed, however, that latest 19-ship package contains most modern
                            weapons, engines, and ship design in the world, and would yield navy
                            possessed of better fire power and even more military effectiveness than
                            under earlier proposals. Cost estimates of latest package, moreover,
                            will be considerably more precise than before. Nothing in latest plan
                            precluded expansion of <gloss target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss> shore
                            installations or ship strength if subsequently desired. Offer of lease
                            to Royal Saudi Navy of two <gloss target="#t_USN_1">USN</gloss> patrol
                            ships as interim measure made per Deputy Secretary’s September 10
                            letter.</p>
                        <p>3. Sultan responded by vehemently reiterating grievances and complaints
                            contained in his letter of August 18 (Jidda’s 3537). In highly
                            rhetorical style he outlined difficulties he had faced in obtaining
                            Council of Ministers’ approval to 596 million dollar naval package; if
                            US negotiators insisted on naval estimates in range of 841 million
                            dollars, he might have no choice but to abdicate personal responsibility
                            for <pb facs="0374" n="339" xml:id="pg_339"/> naval matters. <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> reps could then negotiate directly
                            with higher levels of <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>, or Saudi
                            Arabia might simply have to content itself with a coast guard. Sultan
                            willing, however, to accept some cost adjustments—not to exceed ten
                            percent, or total of 660 million dollars—if shore facilities and
                            installations not put back and if other aspects of former plan are
                            adhered to. Ambassador in reply pointed out that latest US proposals
                            were indeed different from earlier <gloss target="#t_SNEP_1"
                                >SNEP</gloss> package, but that end product likely to be even more
                            effective. Sultan continued to emphasize that final naval package should
                            highlight usefulness, effectiveness and modernity of equipment and shore
                            installations. <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> demanded maximum
                            responsiveness from <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> within
                            budgetary framework of his latest position (595 million dollars plus ten
                            percent). Saudis seemed interested in <gloss target="#t_DepSec_1"
                                >DepSec</gloss>’s proposal per Sept 10 letter, but no final action
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>4. At Sultan’s direction September 17 and 18 devoted to technical
                            discussions between <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> team
                            and reps on Saudi Navy, headed by Commander Saja. Commander clearly
                            lacked technical and linguistic skills to comprehend nature of US
                            proposals. With regard to propulsion units, he continued to favor German
                            diesel “Maybach” engines, despite convincing presentations re merits of
                            gas turbine. He also attached great importance to acquisition of
                            flagship, and undiminished shore facilities.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> team returned Jidda
                            evening September 18, and in company of Chargé <persName
                                corresp="#p_HH_1">Horan</persName> called upon Prince Sultan
                            September 19. Chargé began presentation by stating that US team felt
                            progress had been achieved in course of frank and forthcoming
                            discussions in Riyadh; <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> proposals we
                            believed incorporated most modern and effective concepts of naval
                            weapons, design, and organization. We were confident that after further
                            review with officials of <gloss target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss>, final
                            proposals could be drawn up responsive to <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss>’s needs and His Royal Highness’ directives. Chargé
                            added that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> had
                            prepared letter that he wished to leave with <gloss target="#t_HRH_1"
                                >HRH</gloss> and that outlined main points and advantages of US
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>6. Sultan listened carefully to reading of letter and announced that he
                            found its contents most satisfactory. As basis for his further review,
                            he then directed that schedule of comparisons be prepared making clear
                            differences between former US proposal and terms of latest one.
                            Differences should be noted, and careful explanation provided as to why
                            latest formulation required, and why it advantageous for <gloss
                                target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss>. Shore installations continued to
                            have importance; above all Sultan would never accept any changes that
                            might diminish military capabilities of <gloss target="#t_RSNF_1"
                                >RSNF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> assured Prince that
                            review of <gloss target="#t_SNEP_1">SNEP</gloss> caused by price
                            increases would actually result in increasing the modernity and striking
                            power of Saudi Navy. A number of technical points, however, such <pb
                                facs="0375" n="340" xml:id="pg_340"/> as precise costing of weapons
                            and relative merits of turbine/diesel propulsion units required further
                            discussion. This could perhaps best be done with <gloss
                                target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss> representatives in Washington. Time
                            was important to US side, moreover, since <gloss target="#t_LOA_1"
                                >LOA</gloss>’s due to expire Nov. 30, 1973. Accordingly, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> urged Sultan to
                            despatch team of <gloss target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss> officers to
                            Washington <gloss target="#t_ASAP_1">ASAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. At this point <gloss target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss> Commander Saja
                            interjected complaint that latest US proposals had omitted flagship;
                            Commander believed flagship important because of its relatively greater
                            operating range and depth of radar coverage it could provide for smaller
                                <gloss target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss> craft. Saja professed to be
                            unconvinced by US team’s claims of operating radius for PG’s. To this
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName> replied that flagship
                            not omitted from US plan, but that its acquisition merely postponed
                            until future date. As to radar, this another technical question that two
                            sides could review in Washington.</p>
                        <p>9. Sultan refused to address himself to points raised by Commander Saja.
                            He stated that he had no objections to <gloss target="#t_RSNF_1"
                                >RSNF</gloss> team of Commander Saja, Commander Rashad and one other
                            officer proceeding immediately to US for further discussions. Sultan’s
                            Office Director called in and ordered to make immediate arrangements for
                            such travel through COS. Sultan then stated that he wished all aspects
                            of US proposals to be studied carefully and objectively; when study was
                            complete, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> team should return with
                            report specifying areas of agreement or disagreement. Sultan shared Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJH_1">Noyes</persName>’ concern that <gloss
                                target="#t_SNEP_1">SNEP</gloss> review be completed promptly. Prince
                            willing to meet again with team any time, even during Ramadan, so long
                            as this did not involve High Holy Days (approximately October 23–30).
                            Finally, he asked Saja for report on discussions to date with US team so
                            that info could be provided to King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>10. Prior to departure of Rear Admiral Gerhard September 20, additional
                            background material left with <gloss target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss>
                            consisting of (a) cost escalation slides, (b) summary description of new
                            US naval development proposals, (c) program milestones if <gloss
                                target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss> accepts Deputy Secretary’s offer to
                            lease two PGs.</p>
                        <p>11. Comment: Sultan ready to listen to further US explanations based upon
                            our professional assessment of latest technological developments and
                                <gloss target="#t_RSNF_1">RSNF</gloss>’s needs. We encouraged by
                            practical and realistic tone of his remarks in latest meeting. Prince
                            seems determined to keep his options open and not to allow his
                            subordinates to paint him into a corner. Some hard bargaining probably
                            still lies ahead and a special effort will have to be made in Washington
                            to wean Commander Saja from certain positions he stubbornly adhering to
                            out of pride and naval inexperience.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY. <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> affirmed that Saudi
                            Arabia wants to help the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in meeting
                            its energy problem and has the reserves of oil to increase its
                            production substantially. In return, however, Saudi Arabia expects
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> support for Saudi
                            industrialization to help it create an alternative source of income for
                            the use of non-renewable assets and a more active <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> role in achieving a Middle East
                            settlement. He reiterated on several occasions that Saudi Arabia’s
                            political requirements were just as important as its economic
                            requirements. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName>
                            indicated that the Saudi position was well understood and probed
                                <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName>’s views regarding the
                            possible fielding of a high-level <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            economic/investment mission to Saudi Arabia to table specific proposals.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> welcomed the idea,
                            provided the mission had positive suggestions on the political side as
                            well. Otherwise it would not be very useful. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>After welcoming Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> to
                            Washington, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> said
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> places great importance in its
                            relations with Saudi Arabia. He personally was delighted with the
                            appointment of <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">James Akins</persName> as our
                            next Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, whom the Minister had met that morning.
                            He hoped that the interest of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            in Saudi Arabia would be reflected during the Minister’s talks in
                            Washington. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> shared the Saudi
                            desire for an improvement in the Middle East <pb facs="0377" n="342"
                                xml:id="pg_342"/> atmosphere and the importance we attached to this
                            had been demonstrated again most recently by the President in his
                            September 5 statement and by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> said he wanted at the outset
                            to deliver a message from King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> which was that Saudi Arabia was willing within
                            its capabilities to do everything to help the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> with its energy problem. The <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> could depend on Saudi Arabia but it must understand,
                            as the King had indicated on a number of occasions, that it is difficult
                            to continue this friendship if it is not reciprocated by the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in the form of a change of policy in
                            the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> did
                            not mean just statements; he wanted something positive he could point
                            to.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> felt there had been a
                            misunderstanding about Saudi Arabia’s position. He understood some
                            quarters in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> now felt that the
                            Saudis were emphasizing only economic aspects of development as a
                            requirement for increased oil production. This was not so. There had
                            been no change in the Saudi position, and the political side was central
                            to the Saudis as they consider whether to increase oil production.</p>
                        <p>He had gone to great pains in his speeches in New York, San Francisco and
                            Los Angeles to avoid statements of confrontation. He did not think this
                            would lead anywhere. It was Saudi Arabia’s intention to pursue
                            cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> “to the
                            furthest possible point” and to do it away from the public forum.
                            However, this should not be misinterpreted. Saudi Arabia believed the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> needed to take a very active
                            role in the Middle East now because no other country can do so.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> said he believed
                            Saudi Arabia’s position was well understood. He welcomed the careful way
                            in which the Minister had presented his points in his speech in New York
                            (before the American-Arab Association of Commerce). Unfortunately, the
                            press could often convey erroneous impressions which portrayed
                            producer-consumer relations in confrontation terms. There had, for
                            example, been articles in the papers that the consumers will band
                            together against the producers. This was not true. It was the intention
                            of consumer countries to settle any differences with the oil producers
                            through diplomatic negotiations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> remarked that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG_1">Shultz</persName> in a recent statement
                            in Tokyo had referred to oil producers “swaggering” in their dealings
                            with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> He was not entirely sure
                            what this meant or who it was directed to. Saudi Arabia was not a major
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> supplier, exporting only 4% of
                            its production to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> interjected to say that
                            this remark was not directed at Saudi Arabia. It was made during the oil
                            company discussions with Libya and was directed at that situation. He
                            regretted that there had been any misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> continued that if Saudi
                            Arabia were to expand its oil sales to the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> to the point where it would hurt the Saudi economy,
                            the <pb facs="0378" n="343" xml:id="pg_343"/> Government must have a
                            legal and economic justification because of its responsibility to its
                            people and the next generations. This required <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> cooperation in helping Saudi Arabia develop and
                            industrialize in a way which provides new sources of income once oil is
                            depleted. But Saudi cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> would be difficult unless the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> also shows an interest in the “pains and sufferings”
                            of the Middle East. Saudi Arabia could not just develop and stand aloof
                            from the political problems of the area.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> remarked that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had not remained aloof from the
                            pain and suffering of the world’s nations, noting the considerable
                            amount of aid provided over the past 25 years. Regarding the Middle
                            East, he believed the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was prepared
                            to take a fresh look and approach problems in the area with an open
                            mind. He stressed that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> hopes
                            that Saudi Arabia will make investments and hold reserves in a way that
                            achieves its industrial development goals and also promotes
                            international monetary cooperation. Further, he said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is seeking to provide the proper
                            climate for sound investment in the United States. He believed the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could play a significant role
                            in helping Saudi Arabia in meeting its objective to industrialize.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> reiterated that he hoped
                            everyone would understand that Saudi objectives for economic development
                            were not more important than arriving at a just solution in the Middle
                            East. He had concentrated on economic development in his meetings in the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> because this is his specialty.
                            This did not by any means mean that this was the only aspect. He
                            believed the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> can take an active
                            role in achieving a settlement in the Middle East which for the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> should be just as important if not
                            more so than issues relating to China, Europe, or elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> said he did not
                            believe the Minister would find any misunderstanding on the part of the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> The Secretary noted that during
                            the past several months, there had been a number of discussions and
                            papers prepared for a possible economic investment mission to Saudi
                            Arabia which might leave six weeks from now and which he prospectively
                            might lead. The Secretary wanted to take this opportunity to ask the
                            Minister’s views whether (a) this mission was a good idea, and (b) the
                            subjects that might be raised by the mission.</p>
                        <p>The Minister replied that the idea was good provided the mission could
                            achieve positive results. If, however, the mission did not take into
                            consideration political as well as economic issues, it would not be very
                            useful. He observed that Saudi Arabia was in a position different from
                            most LDCs. If it wants technical help from the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>, it can, as it has done, hire expertise. This is what
                            the Central Planning Organization has done when it employed the services
                            of the Stanford Research Institute in developing the Kingdom’s first
                            plan. Where the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could <pb
                                facs="0379" n="344" xml:id="pg_344"/> play a role is making
                            available technology which Saudi Arabia does not have such as solar
                            energy, desert reclamation, and manpower training. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had shared its technology with Saudi
                            Arabia for desalting and there were endless technical areas for
                            cooperation. But whatever the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has
                            to offer to Saudi Arabia, the political question will always arise.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> said he hoped
                            there could be some compatibility between economic and political
                            requirements. There was much the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            could do for Saudi Arabia and much Saudi Arabia could do for the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Discussions relating to the proposed
                            mission had considered a number of areas such as a tax treaty, tariff
                            adjustments, and investment in securities. The mission would want to
                            make specific proposals, not just broad generalizations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> replied “wonderful” but it
                            was important not to forget that the mission should also have positive
                            suggestions on the political side because he knew what King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s reaction would be without
                            them. Selling Phantoms or <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            reiterations of its long-standing relationships with Saudi Arabia will
                            not be enough. <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> wants
                            some concrete actions by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> on the
                            Arab/Israel issue. Saudi Arabia can defend itself politically, morally
                            and religiously but if radicals continue to extend their influence in
                            the Middle East because of the lack of peace in the area and the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> does not try to win over the Arabs,
                            the Free World will suffer and the Communists will benefit. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> felt a great social experiment
                            was now underway in Saudi Arabia. The nation was mixing individual
                            endeavor with government support in its development, with the government
                            trying to minimize its role to encourage individual initiative. If this
                            experiment succeeded, it would have an impact throughout the Arab world
                            where other methods of development had been tried and had failed.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> energy problem,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> said that of all
                            the problems with which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is
                            confronted, he believed the energy situation was the most solvable. The
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was blessed with many
                            resources, and it had the technology to develop alternate resources. The
                            Alaska pipeline should soon get underway, offshore leases for
                            prospecting on the continental shelf will be authorized, gas will be
                            deregulated, and measures taken to develop our large coal resources. He
                            emphasized that the President’s energy message was aimed at fostering a
                            vigorous domestic energy industry and that it contained the answers to
                            our problem. He described the message as a blueprint for action that
                            must and will be taken. There is no question that we will depend to an
                            increasing extent on foreign supply for the rest of this decade, but he
                            was optimistic that by following the President’s program, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would be able to solve its energy
                            problems.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> said the Saudi Government
                            had been pleased with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName>’s April 18 energy statement. Saudi Arabia believed
                            it had enough <pb facs="0380" n="345" xml:id="pg_345"/> oil resources to
                            continue supplying Europe and Japan but if the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> came into the picture, with its enormous demands, it
                            would disrupt the Saudi supply picture. Were Saudi Arabia required to up
                            production to 20 million bpd, it would mean depleting its presently
                            known oil resources in 18–20 years. This was not enough time for Saudi
                            Arabia to develop its infrastructure or the industries it will need to
                            replace its depletable resources. Therefore, Saudi Arabia would want the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to find other sources of fuel
                            and would welcome seeing the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> return
                            to relative self-sufficiency in energy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> noted that just as
                            Saudi Arabia was blessed with an abundance of petroleum, the United
                            States also had plentiful natural resources. Also, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has developed an agricultural
                            expertise which has enabled us to utilize many of these resources. These
                            natural resources will enable us to develop alternate sources of energy
                            to oil which in turn will put us on the road to being self-sufficient in
                            energy. Despite these initiatives, however, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> noted that conservation will play
                            an increasingly important role during the next few years. He mentioned
                            that we have undertaken to educate the American people about the
                            necessity to conserve energy, and he felt that these efforts had begun
                            to produce results.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> welcomed this development.
                            The Saudis had been taught to believe that oil was cheap because the
                            cost of production was low. However, if one considers that it is a
                            depletable and non-renewable resource, it is not fair to set a low
                            price. Revenues from oil have to be used to buy imported commodities for
                            the livelihood of the populace and capital goods to develop the economy
                            to establish a substitute for oil as the source of the country’s
                            productive wealth.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> concluded by expressing
                            appreciation for his meeting with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1"
                                >Simon</persName> and his hospitality. He wanted to emphasize that
                            Saudi Arabia was not trying to threaten the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> The Saudis knew the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> was a big power and could take over Saudi Arabia any
                            time but he had wanted to make his government’s point of view very
                            clear. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> said the
                            message was clear, and he assured Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"
                                >Nazir</persName> that the concerns of Saudi Arabia were being given
                            first priority at the highest levels of our government.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY. <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> conveyed Saudi
                            Arabia’s continued desire to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> but the Saudis want this friendship reciprocated by
                            acts and not talk. The Kingdom’s oil production is already in excess of
                            revenue requirements. To go beyond present production levels requires
                            economic and political justifications including: (a) <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> cooperation in Saudi efforts to
                            industrialize and diversify the economy to replace a non-renewable
                            asset; and (b) <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy initiatives
                            to improve the political atmosphere in the Middle East. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was interested in working with the
                            Saudis to find productive use for their surplus revenues and to improve
                            the atmosphere in the Middle East. The latter, as Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> kept pointing out, was very
                            difficult to do without getting a negotiating process started. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> argued that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> insistence on negotiations while
                            continuing to supply substantial arms, credits, and grants to Israel
                            only froze the situation. This had encouraged Israel’s principal
                            political party to pursue annexation policies in newly occupied
                            territories. He hoped for a change in <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> policy soon; otherwise Saudi Arabia’s close ties with
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will become almost untenable.
                            END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>After welcoming the Minister’s visit to Washington, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> recalled that he had first
                            visited Saudi Arabia in 1938 and had almost been assigned as Ambassador
                            in 1965. He had not been back to Saudi Arabia for ten years and would
                            like to see its development. <pb facs="0382" n="347" xml:id="pg_347"/>
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> observed that
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> had been following
                            balanced economic and political policies in a difficult world. The
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has admired <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s efforts and his leadership
                            and recognized that it had not been easy for Saudi Arabia to maintain
                            its many Western connections. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            remains seriously interested in maintaining close relations with Saudi
                            Arabia in the economic field and in efforts to reach a settlement of the
                            Arab-Israel issue.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> said he had been
                            instructed to deliver a message from his Government which was that Saudi
                            Arabia also wanted to continue its friendly relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> However, it was interested in
                            activating this friendship rather than talking about it. Saudi Arabia
                            was presently producing oil at its maximum capacity and beyond the
                            country’s revenue requirements. For Saudi Arabia’s oil production to go
                            beyond this level, there must be economic and political justification.
                            The first would mean <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> cooperation in
                            Saudi Arabia’s efforts to build up its infrastructure and industrialize
                            in order to create an alternative source of income for a non-renewable
                            asset. The second would be an improvement in the political atmosphere of
                            the Middle East. By this, Saudi Arabia did not want mere <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> expressions of intention but active
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> participation in seeking a
                            solution to the Arab-Israel problem.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government understood the Saudi
                            position. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was deeply engaged in
                            trying to establish in the Middle East the kind of atmosphere the
                            Minister had mentioned. This effort has been accorded the highest
                            priority as President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                            himself had said on September 5 and as Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had reiterated a few days
                            ago. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, however, has great
                            difficulty in bringing about what is essential for this
                            atmosphere—creating a negotiating situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> observed he had
                            been involved in his years in the Foreign Service in many difficult
                            negotiations including those with the Communists in Paris over Vietnam.
                            Even during the years when the situation looked hopeless, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had persisted. We had learned from
                            long experience that there is no substitute for negotiations. Without
                            some form of contact, it is impossible to work out anything. In Paris
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had an advantage in that it was
                            a direct participant. In the Arab-Israel matter, it is not. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> cannot work miracles and impose
                            solutions but it will continue to work to bring the parties together to
                            get the negotiating process started. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> added that he had lived 30 years
                            in the Arab world and understood the depth of feeling over the Palestine
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Something had to be done to bring it to a satisfactory solution but there
                            was no substitute for bringing the parties together. With the passage of
                            time, changes occur and if there is a constant effort to reach <pb
                                facs="0383" n="348" xml:id="pg_348"/> a solution and a contact
                            between the parties occurs, then patience will pay off. War was no
                            substitute. While it gives whoever is strongest a temporary advantage, a
                            final settlement can only come if there is a solution which meets the
                            legitimate aspirations of both sides and which the younger generation
                            will accept.</p>
                        <p>With regard to economic relations, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1"
                                >Porter</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            supports Saudi aspirations to diversify the Kingdom’s resources and to
                            use <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> investment as it desires. We
                            recognize that Saudi Arabia is providing the world with a great
                            resource, and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government is
                            encouraging American business firms to see if there are areas of
                            cooperation which are acceptable to Saudi Arabia. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> hoped the Minister’s talks in
                            Washington would convince him of the serious attention being given at
                            high levels in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government to
                            cooperate with the Saudis to invest their surplus revenues productively.
                            At the same time, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> did not
                            underestimate at all the need to bring about an improvement in the
                            political climate in the Middle East the Minister had mentioned.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> replied that what Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> had said about
                            negotiations in terms of political science is correct but in this
                            instance, the circumstances are different. Since there is a victor who
                            continues to receive the support of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> in the form of arms, credits, grants, and other
                            assistance, his position is frozen and negotiations are almost useless.
                            Israel has no incentive to change the situation. In fact, the platform
                            of its principal political party now calls for measures which would
                            result in outright annexation of territories occupied during the June
                            1967 war. The introduction of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            as a third party in the Arab-Israel question would be useful but there
                            are other things the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could also do
                            to show its intentions. It could end its unrestricted arms supply and
                            economic aid to Israel, for example. By only pushing for a policy of
                            negotiation, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was supporting the
                            position of the victor.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> understood and
                            appreciated this frank statement. However, what really was essential was
                            the disposition of the two principals to begin talking. There was no way
                            for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to move unless this was
                            assured. If there was an indication of a disposition for serious
                            contact, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would be able to take
                            positive steps to help the negotiations get started and achieve useful
                            results. But it is very difficult to do anything in the absence of
                            assurance that the two parties are going to talk.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> commented that under these
                            circumstances and if <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> aid to Israel
                            continues, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in effect is asking
                            the Arabs to accept the annexation of Arab lands by force of arms.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> replied that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was not asking the Arabs to do
                            this at all. What we believed in was that contact between both <pb
                                facs="0384" n="349" xml:id="pg_349"/> sides was necessary to have
                            the gradual emergence of a position that could be worked out. The fact
                            that contacts were underway would cause many nations, including the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, to review what they could do
                            to encourage further progress in the negotiating process. Getting
                            negotiations going would bring all kinds of useful results outside of
                            the negotiations themselves. We understood it was difficult for Arab
                            leaders to contemplate this but we believed it could be done.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> said he hoped that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would consider changing its
                            position. Otherwise, it will mean that the situation in the Middle East
                            will remain frozen and Saudi Arabia’s close ties with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will be very difficult to maintain;
                            they will be “almost untenable.” <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"
                                >Nazir</persName> said the point of his mission in Washington was to
                            encourage the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to do what it can in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and outside to take an active
                            role. Given Israel’s heavy dependence on the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> for arms and aid, Saudi Arabia was convinced the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could do more. Saudi Arabia did
                            not see how the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> could condone
                            annexation of territory by acts of war; this was not congruent with
                            American aspirations. As friends of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>, the Saudis wanted the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> to change this impression.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> said that the
                            impression the Minister referred to had been built up among those who
                            had been hurt but the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> had never
                            condoned military aggrandizement. Whenever the latter occurs, it has an
                            unstabilizing effect if it is maintained. But once it occurs, there is
                            no substitute to getting the parties together to try and settle the
                            matter by the force of logic rather than by the force of arms.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> said the purpose of his
                            message had been two-fold: to try and persuade the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to do more on the political aspects of
                            the Middle East problem and to get more <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> support for Saudi economic development efforts. He
                            wanted to stress that the two were intertwined. Saudi Arabia was
                            embarked on a challenging social experiment to develop its economy and
                            human resources where the private sector played a major role with the
                            government remaining in the background. If this social experiment
                            succeeded, it might be copied by others in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia
                            would be extremely unhappy if the lack of a Middle East settlement would
                            upset Saudi development.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> replied that all
                            that the Minister had said simply added to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> determination to try and bring about something in the
                            Middle East that will unlock the impasse. Meanwhile, we continued to
                            appreciate Saudi restraint in view of the apparent political
                            difficulties. The Minister’s views had been clear and valuable, as is
                            Saudi Arabia’s friendship for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>,
                            and these views will be conveyed throughout the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            don’t want to overburden Your Excellency by taking up more of your time,
                            but I want to express appreciation for your visit.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            I want to thank you, Your Highness. I was looking forward to welcoming
                            you to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I’m
                            very pleased, and still look towards it.</p>
                        <p>I would like to take this opportunity to express the hope that the
                            friendship between the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Saudi
                            Arabia which was strong in the past will remain strong.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            This is our hope.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> And
                            these things that have come between us I would like to consider as
                            things that are transitory and not permanent in nature.</p>
                        <p>And of course I appreciate listening to your explaining so brilliantly to
                            His Majesty the King the difficulties for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> and the particular difficulties that would not be
                            understood by those who do not know the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss></p>
                        <p>And I would assure Your Excellency that I for one will be instrumental
                            among those who will help you on the path you have marked out.</p>
                        <pb facs="0386" n="351" xml:id="pg_351"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            If this cannot be done, my path will be immeasurably more difficult.
                            Because when the whole atmosphere in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> becomes focused on what will appear as a domestic
                            problem, it will be impossible to mobilize ourselves for a difficult
                            foreign struggle.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            That’s actually what I am saying—that while we feel at ease hearing you
                            outline the steps you have embarked upon, I feel inevitably the results
                            will be good. And we appreciate the fact that things cannot be done
                            overnight and have to be done step-by-step, but expeditiously.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            I appreciate your understanding.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I’m
                            known for looking at things from a practical point of view, not in the
                            clouds.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            That is the only way to get things solved.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> And
                            now we are beginning to feel in the air, after a long time, the thread
                            of a solution that would be acceptable to the Arabs and Israel.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            I have the same sense. A year ago I thought the time was not right; now
                            I feel the time is right.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> Of
                            course I appreciate that difficulties will be felt by people in Japan
                            and the United States and Europe. But every cloud has a silver
                            lining—the thread has now appeared.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName>:</hi> I
                            want to emphasize one point that the Secretary said to His Majesty—that
                            the present effort did not begin when the war started, but before the
                            war started, and certainly before this boycott. I was with the Secretary
                            in New York and he said specifically that we would make a major
                            effort.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Thank you.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            heard that declaration myself and was very impressed.</p>
                        <p>The first step, as the Secretary said, was easing of relocation of the
                            Third Army.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Right. And it was very difficult.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> It
                            was very difficult. Because these are exactly the kind of steps that
                            themselves could be used for telling our friends: Look at what the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has done, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is willing to do more.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Yes.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> And
                            we hope that at the peace conference that you mentioned will be the
                            first of next month, a further tangible step will come that will help
                            further.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Inevitably. I’m looking at it from the diplomatic point of view. But
                            please tell His Majesty that if we are to move effectively at the
                            conference, it will help if some easing had already taken place.
                            Otherwise it will get confused in our domestic problem.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            appreciate that. I will personally do what I can to bring this
                            about.</p>
                        <pb facs="0387" n="352" xml:id="pg_352"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            It will help tremendously in our common effort.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            appreciate that very much.</p>
                        <p>This is something touching on the situation in Saudi Arabia, and in Iraq
                            and southern Arabia. We have evidence that keeps coming to
                            us—certifiable—that there seems to be a pincer movement around Saudi
                            Arabia and the Gulf. The Chinese from the south, the Soviet Union from
                            Iraq. That is why we anticipate that once this immediate problem is
                            solved, the Communists will contrive something to happen in Saudi
                            Arabia.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            That is why it is essential that between the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> and Saudi Arabia there be no misunderstanding. You are
                            the principal target. If you isolate yourselves you are losing one of
                            your best supporters. I told His Majesty at dinner that we are prepared
                            to be helpful with respect to the threat from the south. And of course
                            we can cooperate with regard to the threat from the north. Perhaps when
                            Your Highness comes to the United States we can consult further on
                            this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> In
                            fact we are in dire need to organize our armed forces—the army, navy,
                            air force—not with any aggressive intent but to defend ourselves.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Exactly.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName>:</hi> We
                            told them first that the program would cost $200 million. Then we said,
                            “Sorry, there’s been a miscalculation. It will cost $650 million.” Then
                            we said later, “No, it will be $900 million.” They think we’re not
                            serious.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            I don’t have the facts. But we take this very seriously. We intend to

                        </opener>
                        <p>I have received from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> a full report of his trip to the Middle East,
                            of the opening phase of the Geneva Conference, and, in particular, of
                            his most recent meeting with Your Majesty. Based on this report, I
                            continue to believe there is opportunity for progress toward a peace
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>As Your Majesty knows, much has already been accomplished. The ceasefire,
                            the six-point agreement, the opening of the Peace Conference, important
                            as they are, are only beginnings. We are committed, as I wrote you, to
                            full support and implementation of the November 1967 Security Council
                            Resolution 242. We have made progress also in developing the basic
                            principles of a disengagement agreement with Egypt, subject, of course,
                            to a number of details still to be worked out and negotiated. Israel has
                            sent its military representatives to Geneva where they are meeting with
                            Egyptian military representatives looking towards an early agreement on
                            the disengagement of forces. We have also arranged for Defense Minister
                            Dayan to come next week to the United States so that we can pursue the
                            full details with him of a disengagement agreement. All of these are
                            solid achievements brought about almost exclusively by United States
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>I am deeply convinced that our two Nations stand at the threshold of a
                            great turning point in history. We can, if we have the will, bring a new
                            era of peace and prosperity to all the peoples of the Arab world. But
                            should we fail, we will condemn the Middle East to a long and bitter
                            continuation of the conflict which has for too long plagued the area.
                            For my part, I pledge myself to do everything in my power to <pb
                                facs="0389" n="354" xml:id="pg_354"/> ensure that my second term as
                            President will be remembered as the period in which the United States
                            developed a new and productive relationship with the entire Arab
                            world.</p>
                        <p>I am also convinced, however, that only if the United States continues to
                            play a major and decisive role in the negotiations now underway in
                            Geneva can we hope for any lasting success. But in order to make it
                            possible for me to move decisively it is necessary that the
                            discrimination against the United States, which the oil embargo
                            represents, be brought to an end. Thus, Your Majesty, I must tell you in
                            all frankness that I have noted with dismay the December 25 decision of
                            the Arab oil ministers in Kuwait to increase Arab oil production by ten
                            percent to help meet the needs of Japan and various European countries
                            while continuing the embargo against the United States. This action has
                            put me in a most difficult position since it constitutes a continuation
                            of a policy of discrimination against the United States. You know from
                            our past exchanges that we believe it is essential that the United
                            States be in a position to engage itself in a positive manner free of
                            outside pressures. The activities of the last several months demonstrate
                            clearly and without equivocation the role the United States has played
                            and would intend to play in order to help bring about a just and durable
                            peace agreement in the area. You know the great stress I place on close
                            relations with the Arab world and with Saudi Arabia in particular.
                            However, the clearly discriminatory action of the oil producers can
                            vitiate totally the effective contribution the United States is
                            determined to make in the days ahead. Therefore, I must tell you in
                            candor that it is absolutely essential that the oil embargo and oil
                            production restrictions against the United States be ended
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>I have felt free, Your Majesty, to write to you again so frankly because
                            I know from all our recent exchanges of messages, most recently your
                            letter of December 25, that you are as concerned as I am not only with
                            achieving real progress towards peace but also with strengthening the
                            long-standing friendship between our two countries. I am writing to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> in a similar vein
                            since I believe it is important that we all fully understand each
                            other’s points of view, particularly since our role may prove to be
                            decisive in the upcoming disengagement talks between Egypt and
                            Israel.</p>
                        <p>In closing, I would like to express my gratitude for the cordial welcome
                            and hospitality you have extended to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and his party on his most
                            recent visit to your great country. He has reiterated to me how much
                            Your Majesty values our continued friendship. I can assure you that this
                            is also our desire, and that we look forward to working closely with you
                            in the year ahead toward a solution of the political, economic and other
                            problems which confront our two peoples. For this reason it is essential
                            that the prevailing difficulties be resolved <pb facs="0390" n="355"
                                xml:id="pg_355"/> promptly so that we can look to a future in which
                            the relationships between our two countries will be reaffirmed and
                            strengthened.</p>

                        <p>1. You should transmit immediately following letter from the President to
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin text.</p>
                        <p>Your Majesty:</p>
                        <p>I was gratified to hear from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1"
                                >Akins</persName> of his long and fruitful audience with you on
                            January 23. It is heartening to me, and a measure of the strength and
                            depth of the friendship between our two countries, that we can exchange
                            views in a spirit of mutual understanding and respect when differences
                            arise between us, and together overcome those differences.</p>
                        <p>In earlier messages to Your Majesty I have said that events have proven
                            the wisdom of your counsel over the years. My government is now embarked
                            upon and committed to a course of action that can, I am convinced, bring
                            a just and durable peace to the Middle East. The <pb facs="0391" n="356"
                                xml:id="pg_356"/> first fruits of that commitment are reflected in
                            the agreement on the disengagement of forces signed last Friday, under
                            which Israeli forces will withdraw into Sinai as a first step toward a
                            final peace settlement in accordance with Security Council Resolutions
                            338 and 242.</p>
                        <p>The disengagement of forces provided for in the agreement will begin this
                            Friday and will, I am confident, be completed within the period
                            prescribed in the agreement. In addition, during Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s last visit to the Middle
                            East we have initiated efforts looking toward parallel progress with
                            respect to the Syrian-Israeli and Jordanian-Israeli aspects of a
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>I was pleased to hear from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1"
                                >Akins</persName> of the positive view Your Majesty has taken of
                            these achievements on the road to peace, which are in accordance with
                            our earlier assurances to you. It is a source of satisfaction to me that
                            for your part you intend, as soon as the withdrawal of Israeli forces
                            begins, to initiate contacts with other Arab governments and that a
                            favorable decision on lifting the boycott will then be possible.</p>
                        <p>I would plan to announce this decision when I deliver my State of the
                            Union message the evening of January 30. This decision by Your Majesty
                            and other Arab governments will accord with our common interests in
                            working for a free, prosperous, and peaceful Middle East. It will have a
                            most favorable impact on the Members of Congress and the American people
                            and will enable the US to continue our efforts in the search for peace
                            with justice. I look forward to remaining in close touch with Your

                        </list>
                        <p>Our interest in a bilateral arrangement with the Saudis is different from
                            the Europeans’ interest and even from our own interest before Project
                            Independence. With our commitment to Project Independence we are taking
                            steps so that we could import less and less Saudi oil beginning within
                            two years, with perhaps no imports by 1980. Thus while the Europeans
                            want to tie up large amounts of Saudi oil for a long period into the
                            future, our immediate economic interest is concentrated in getting Saudi
                            production up in 1974 and 1975 in order to get prices down (while
                            allowing more oil from the Saudis or elsewhere to reach the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in 1974–5).</p>
                        <p>Because our short-term economic self-interest in Saudi oil is much less
                            than others, we may be in a unique position to broaden and deepen our
                            economic relationship with the Saudis on a basis of mutual
                            self-interest.</p>
                        <p>We want to expand our exports to the Saudis and we would like for the
                            Saudis to invest a substantial part of their excess earnings in the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> We also hope <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> companies will continue to handle
                            Saudi oil because their earnings are important to our balance of
                            payments. We and the Saudis share an interest in developing a role for
                            the companies that keeps their production and marketing skills available
                            to the Saudis.</p>
                        <p>Because it is <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy to keep most
                            economic activity in private hands, we have limited legal authority to
                            engage in a bilateral trading deal—oil for goods. At some point we might
                            want to seek broader <pb facs="0394" n="359" xml:id="pg_359"/> authority
                            perhaps in the context of an agreement with the Saudis requiring
                            Congressional approval, but at this stage emphasis should be on <hi

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">General economic</hi>. We share with the Saudis the
                            objective of avoiding dangerous pressures on western trading and
                            security arrangements arising from the economic consequences of high oil
                            prices. We can discuss such questions as costs of energy from
                            alternative sources and our own plans under Project Independence. We
                            have our own projections on oil supply/demand/prices which we could
                            share with the Saudis. In short, we can help the Saudis decide what
                            prices are in their long-term interest. (We can also lay a basis for
                            subsequent discussions that might result in a secure role for Saudi oil
                            in the long-term <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> market despite
                            Project Independence.) We have a major interest in their short-run
                            production plans, particularly in getting production up to their present
                            potential of over 10 million b/d. This area would include discussion of
                            the role of the companies. Bilateral discussion with the Saudis would be
                            a way of ensuring that later multilateral producer/consumer discussions
                            would serve later <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Saudi
                            interests.</p>

                            other governments. While we do not make investments as a government, we
                            could assist the Saudis in making contact with <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> investors who would be interested and in working out
                            joint venture arrangements as desired. In view of Saudi income we would
                            expect full reimbursement for development services—but under
                            government-to-government auspices. (The Saudis presumably would not want
                            to appear to be competing with poor developing countries for these
                            resources.)</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Saudi investment</hi>. We would like to have the
                            Saudis invest their funds in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            and we are prepared to work out favorable arrangements for them to do
                            so. We could negotiate a favorable tax treaty. But the most interesting
                            areas for discussion are probably new types of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> government obligations tied to a mix of currencies, to
                            gold or to some index to avoid loss of real value through inflation. We
                            have never provided such instruments but Treasury has stated it is
                            prepared to try to work something out with the Saudis (we have
                            considerable legal authority). We can also provide guidance on Saudi
                            investments in our private sector. Although we are not set up as a
                            government to be particularly good in this field, government endorsement
                            of certain Saudi investments might give the Saudis more security.</p>

                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Military supply and training</hi>. We have few legal
                            impediments to expanding our military supply and training arrangements.
                            We can make long-term supply contracts. We would welcome greater Saudi
                            participation in R&amp;D costs of new weapons of interest to
                            them—perhaps in exchange for a premium position on deliveries.</p>
                        <p>The process of developing an economic bilateral, a framework agreement
                            under which specific agreements in the various fields above would be
                            developed, might be for a <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> mission
                            including technicians in the various fields, with strong overall policy
                            level leadership, to visit Saudi Arabia in the next couple of weeks for
                            an initial general exploration to be followed up by more intensive
                            negotiations in each field with a target for final agreement on the
                            framework bilateral and several key elements by the end of April.</p>
                        <p>As our discussions develop, it is possible that we might eventually work
                            out a special deal for Saudi oil to have a place in the future <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> market despite Project Independence.
                            We have the authority needed to work out a special arrangement to give
                            Saudi oil special exemption from import charges on either crude or,
                            probably more significantly, product. We now have a special relationship
                            with Canada. One may be developed with Venezuela. Something special for
                            the Saudis, despite Project Independence, might be held out as a
                            potential benefit as our relationship deepens. A period in which the
                            Saudis reestablish the position of their crude in our market over the
                            next few months would be a prerequisite to any agreement to assure them
                            possible moderation of Project Independence and share of our future
                            market. This idea raises such a fundamental issue regarding Project
                            Independence that I have not yet raised it with <persName

                            I gain weight every time I come here.</p>

                            It’s normal when one is on the hungry side as you must be on these
                            trips, that one “dives in.” I am very pleased to see you in such good
                            health and in our country. I know that your work is most taxing.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            One of the advantages of working in this area is that I am dealing with
                            people I like. It is not like negotiating with the North Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            Thank the Lord for that. We follow the news of your negotiations with
                            great interest. We pray to Almighty God that your health and energy last
                            and that the results of your work will be successful. Of first
                            importance to us is the US-Saudi bilateral relationship.</p>

                            That is also very important to us and on this trip I want to pay
                            particular attention to this subject. When the embargo is lifted, we
                            hope to be able to exchange missions to discuss the important economic
                            subjects that are so significant a part of our relationship.</p>

                            This is excellent. Our country is developing, and we need technical
                            help.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            We have made very extensive studies. We are prepared to discuss very
                            large projects in Saudi Arabia and in the US. Our thought is to create
                            some joint commissions.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            That is very good.</p>

                            I hope you can come to the United States on a visit very soon.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            Thank you. As you know, Saudi Arabia in the past could not afford vast
                            expansion projects. Now we can, and we want to work them out in
                            cooperation with the United States. As you know, the European countries
                            want long-term projects with us but we have declined because we want a
                            close relationship with the US.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            We want such a relationship because our security interests are parallel.
                            We both want to keep out the Communists and those dominated by the
                            Communists. We want to help with the domestic stability of our friends.
                            We have always considered Saudi Arabia our natural ally in this area. We
                            are prepared to extend our cooperation further into the security field
                            and to send a military mission here, or you could send a military
                            mission to Washington. But above all, we should plan for 10 years. We
                            can give you whatever technical advice you feel you need.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            This is very excellent. I agree with the need to exchange missions and
                            to absorb the latest techniques. We are proud of our security program
                            here, but we want the latest techniques.</p>

                            In the economic field, we are prepared to develop long-term projects and
                            scientific exchanges.</p>

                            This is excellent. Our thinking is that there should be joint capital
                            because both sides will take the projects more seriously. I would like
                            to see Saudi capital invested in the US. The American people would begin
                            to see the fruits of our relationship. I would also like to see American
                            capital invested here for the same reason.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            We would be prepared to discuss some protection against inflation when
                            you invest in the US. We have studied how this might be done. At the
                            right moment, you could send an expert to the US or we could send one
                            here.</p>

                            hope that you have been successful in your visits to Syria and
                            Israel.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            You know that they are both very difficult, but we have made progress.
                            Israel will send a representative to Washington in about 10 days, then
                            Syria will send a representative to Washington after that. Then we will
                            begin to shape the negotiations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> As
                            long as the first basic steps have been taken, then the next step can be

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            In November, I told His Majesty that we would make every effort to make
                            progress in Egypt. This is more difficult on the Syrian-Israeli
                            front.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            admire your motto: Let action speak.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            My Saudi friends have shown great patience.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            Precisely because our interests are common interests, we can pursue a
                            common goal. I would like to emphasize my own viewpoint—that the Soviet
                            Union and Communist China do not want stability in this area.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            The Soviets are very angry with me. I notice that Gromyko is now
                            following me around the area. Now it appears that he is going back to
                            Syria.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> It
                            is very important to see that the policy of Egypt under President
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> is consistent with King
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s policy.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Yes, that is a great change and a very important one.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            That is very true. I hope that what also can be achieved is to attract
                            Syria into this group.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Perhaps if disengagement can be achieved in Syria, that can be
                            accomplished.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            agree. My opinion is that Asad is a reasonable, moderate man. He is,
                            however, subject to pressures from the Baath Party, from the Soviet
                            Union, and from the Palestinians.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            I like him personally well enough, but he is tough.</p>

                            True. I got to know him first when he came here to Saudi Arabia. As he
                            gets to know you better, he becomes more flexible. Of course, we are
                            speaking as friends when I say that sort of thing. We are very much
                            interested in the status of Jordan and of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>. We have heard rumors that
                            the United States is decreasing its support for Jordan.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Some people report that we are no longer interested in King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>. Were you referring to
                            that?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            No.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Those rumors are not true.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> Of
                            course, every person can have his own interpretation. My view is that if
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> left the West
                            Bank, then he would avoid a lot of problems.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            You don’t think he should negotiate with Israel over the West Bank?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            Yes, it would be a good thing if he were to negotiate. But there would
                            be a conflict if the Palestinians were also negotiating for the same
                            thing at the same time. But there might be some advantage for King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> to step aside from
                            the West Bank for the time being.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Another school of thought is that King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName> should negotiate with Israel for the return of
                            the West Bank and then turn it over to the Palestinians because Israel
                            will not negotiate with the Palestinians.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            That would also be good. It is true that the problems of the
                            Palestinians are different. A solution of the problem of the
                            Palestinians would help bring a solution for the whole area. There will
                            be problems in Lebanon. But after all the parties concerned realize that
                            all are working in cooperation, then we can relax.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            There was hostility between Egypt and Israel at the start, but now that
                            relationship is working much more smoothly. We hope that eventually
                            Syria can be brought into this process. Maybe it can even happen on the
                            West Bank.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> Of
                            course. It is natural that when things begin to settle down, progress
                            will begin to emerge.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            This is why Syrian disengagement is so important.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            True. It will cause the Syrians to think more moderately.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Also the Israelis. But I have found even since November that the mood in
                            the area has become more relaxed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            That is absolutely true. Your efforts in Egypt have shown that results
                            could be accomplished. This has caused us to relax. We sincerely hope
                            that the problem on the Syrian front will be solved. We are concerned
                            about Iraq and South Yemen. We fear that there is a pincers movement
                            working between them.</p>

                            That is our view. That is why we must work together. You have our
                            complete support.</p>

                            They already are. This will be even more true now since the Soviets feel
                            that Egypt is loosening its relationship with the <gloss

                            is my belief that the Syrians will follow the same course. I got this
                            feeling from Asad and from the Deputy Prime Minister and the Economic
                            Minister from Syria. All expressed a serious desire to get rid of Soviet
                            influence. They want to break away from past practices and settle down
                            to their own development.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            I have the impression that they want good relations with the US.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            Yes. I believe that is a fact. I detect that myself, and they asked me
                            to pass it on.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Whenever you want to pass a message to the Syrians, you can say that the
                            US attaches great importance to the improvement of its relationships
                            with Syria and that on all bilateral matters we will meet them more than
                            half-way.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            will particularly mention this. I am going to Syria. I did not want to
                            say anything without having touched base with you.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            You would be doing an act of great friendship if you would say this. We
                            will discuss all matters in this context. We agree that Saudi Arabia and
                            Egypt are moving together now in a better way than they have in the
                            past. If Syria could join them, then the Soviets and the radicals would
                            have less influence and they could not achieve so much.</p>

                            San Francisco, at the Fairmont Hotel in the basement there is a place
                            where women are not admitted. Husbands who are peeved at their wives can
                            go there and let steam off.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            In Saudi Arabia, women are under very good control.</p>

                            There is not much mixing. Inevitably it is going to happen. It cannot be
                            escaped.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>

                            Yes, we can postpone it.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Once you loosen the controls, it is hard to get them back again.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            would like to reiterate our warm welcome to you. My confidence and His
                            Majesty’s confidence in your efforts to resolve these problems is great.
                            And it is important that we develop our relationship together in the
                            fields of common interests.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Your Highness can count on our continuing our peace efforts. Second, we
                            will have talks as soon as possible on joint projects to strengthen our
                            bilateral relationship. Your Highness is always welcome in Washington
                            for this or any other purpose. Third, we are prepared to coordinate our
                            policy with Saudi Arabia very closely as far as the Arabian Peninsula is
                            concerned. We consider the enemies of Saudi Arabia our own enemies.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            was very pleased to hear from Foreign Minister Saqqaf after his meeting
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and with
                            you in Washington.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            If I may say one other thing, we do not want to discuss this in detail,
                            but I do want you to know that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> is under the impression from Saqqaf that at the
                            next meeting of the Arab oil ministers, the embargo will be lifted. For
                            the US it is a question of dignity not to be pressed by our friends. We
                            expect this to happen in the very near future. After that, we can start
                            all of the projects we discussed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            would like to assure you that His Majesty is very interested in
                            “repumping” the oil. Actually this is of moral significance. We see some
                            value to it. This embargo has forestalled those who want to fish in
                            troubled waters.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Now it is a blight on our relationship. If there is another delay in
                            lifting the embargo, there will be a very serious crisis of confidence.
                            Now it is a weapon for the Israelis, not for the Arabs.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            hope the petroleum will be repumped as soon as possible because the last
                            few days I have noticed His Majesty is very much interested in this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            This has been a very good talk. Let me renew my invitation for Your
                            Highness to make an early visit to the US.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            Thank you for extending this invitation again. The person-to-person
                            relationship is very important.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Yes, it is very important because it builds mutual confidence.</p>

                            field we are painfully aware that there have been some delays in dealing
                            with the requests and we will overcome these technical obstacles. We
                            would be willing either to receive a Saudi Arabian military mission or
                            to send a mission here on a substantial program, including the Navy and
                            the Air Force.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"

                        <p>[The King talks briefly to Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>.]</p>
                        <p>We would like to see that happen as expeditiously as possible. And for
                            the dialogue to be effective it would be useful if both those things
                            occurred at the same time; you would send people here and we would send
                            them there.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why do we
                            not begin, Your Majesty, by setting a date next week through our Embassy
                            and your Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"

                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> We will instruct our Ambassador in
                            the very near future.</p>
                        <p>If I may say on a rather delicate thing, Your Majesty, we would not
                            object if Your Majesty transferred some of these weapons to friendly
                            countries, especially Egypt, to reduce Soviet influence there.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName>:</hi> The Soviets are not sending to Egypt arms
                            or anything else.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> This is why a way must be found to
                            keep their capability; and we have temporary domestic difficulties so we
                            are looking for alternative routes of supply.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName>:</hi> We certainly hope that at the same time
                            relations between Egypt and the US will be such so as to preclude their
                            even needing to say hello to the Soviet Union.</p>

                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> This is our strong interest. As you
                            know, President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> has invited
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and that would
                            be a big step forward. The President has asked me to raise the point
                            that he would not feel at ease coming to the Middle East without paying
                            his respects to His Majesty.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName>:</hi> We have no doubt whatever about the
                            sincerity of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and
                            his friendship toward us. If only these thorns could be removed so that
                            the greatest part of the misunderstanding between the Arabs and the US
                            would be removed. If that happens, I would get on a plane and visit the
                            US myself.</p>

                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> The President had in mind, on a
                            visit to the Middle East, to call on His Majesty in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"

                            do that, but we would not want to impose hardship on the President and
                            also on his safety and prestige at home. What is unfortunate indeed is
                            that even some of our friends join along with these people trying to
                            embarrass the President in the US, aided and abetted by the
                            Communists.</p>

                            May, when he is planning his trip, that he will have overcome his most
                            severe difficulties.</p>

                        <p>A. We want to draw Saudis into intensive dialogue on approaches to

                            prices.</p>
                        <p>B. We need to bring US-Saudi relationship closer again and to overcome
                            impression in Saudi minds that US has lost interest in Saudi Arabia and
                            discounts Saudi views.</p>
                        <p>C. We want to establish framework of consultation within which we can
                            pursue our interest in raising Saudi production in 1974 and 1975 in
                            order to get prices down.</p>
                        <p>2. Although we want to move quickly toward establishment of these
                            commissions in the next two or three weeks, it is absolutely essential
                            that we not appear over eager. We want to play this that we have studied
                            extensively the proposals for cooperation which the Saudis have made
                            over the past year and, as a result of a number of studies we have
                            completed, we are now prepared in response to Saudi initiatives for
                            discussions in depth on a wide range of possible areas of cooperation.
                            While you are in process of making your first approaches on concept and
                            procedures, we will be pressing further preparatory staff work in
                            Washington. Any additional thoughts you may have will be most welcome.
                            End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. You are to approach Saudis promptly at high level to begin discussion
                            of formation of joint US-Saudi commissions as described below to develop
                            closer cooperation in economic, military/strategic and scientific
                            fields. Leave to your discretion whom to approach but suggest that, in
                            light of my talks in Riyadh and my invitation to Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> to visit Washington, you start
                            with him. Also, most important in view of my personal relationship to
                            keep Saqqaf fully in picture.</p>
                        <p>4. Following themes should be basic to your presentation:</p>
                        <p>A. We have deeply appreciated Saudi proposals over past year for closer
                            US-Saudi relationship in economic as well as political-military fields.
                            We now ready to respond to Saudi initiative.</p>
                        <p>B. US interest is broad one consistent with its global responsibilities.
                            US not talking about simple trade of oil for industrialization or arms
                            which has characterized recent bilateral deals.</p>
                        <p>C. Purpose of this approach is to broaden and deepen longstanding close
                            US-Saudi relationship.</p>
                        <p>5. You should explain that we envision formation of three commissions,
                            one in each of fields mentioned para 3 above, and seek Saudi reaction.
                            Each commission on our side would be headed at Deputy Secretary level,
                            but we believe it would be appropriate for each side to designate
                            Cabinet-level individual to guide overall effort. Secretary of State
                            would play this role on US side, and though it up to Saudis, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> would seem logical on Saudi
                            side. This should be left entirely to Saudis to decide and we should not
                            press for any particular individual.</p>
                        <pb facs="0407" n="372" xml:id="pg_372"/>
                        <p>6. You may indicate for sake of illustration, that following suggests
                            kinds of subjects we believe each commission could discuss:</p>
                        <p>A. Commission on Economic Cooperation might establish working groups to
                            deal with such issues as: the industrialization of Saudi Arabia;
                            investment both ways; general management of financial reserves;
                            cooperation in helping <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s develop
                            new sources of energy; projections on oil supply, demand, prices;
                            reasonable formula for oil pricing over long term; means of protecting
                            against inflation; informal preparation for later producer-consumer
                            discussions; a tax treaty. Objective might be to think about these
                            subjects in 10-year perspective.</p>
                        <p>B. Commission on science and technology might consider a technical
                            cooperation agreement that would facilitate delivery of reimbursable
                            technical assistance to the Saudi Government and cooperation in helping
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s develop new sources of
                            energy.</p>
                        <p>C. Commission on military cooperation would periodically review strategic
                            assumptions underlying US-Saudi cooperation and status of programs to
                            strengthen Saudi military capability.</p>
                        <p>7. In sum, your objectives at this point are:</p>
                        <p>A. To get Saudi agreement to concept of three joint commissions;</p>
                        <p>B. To reach general understanding on approximate scope of each
                            commission’s responsibility;</p>
                        <p>C. To see whether our notion of level of delegations is acceptable to
                            Saudis;</p>
                        <p>D. To achieve mutual understanding that purpose of <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> visit will be to crystallize
                            plans for commissions and to develop plan of work for <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> party in Washington. In this
                            connection, you might explore generally possibility of joint
                            announcement at end of <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>
                            visit in Washington which could serve as vehicle for negotiating agreed
                            charter for commissions. During <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> visit, schedule for commission meetings and plans
                            for preparatory work could be developed.</p>
                        <p>E. To reflect flexibility on our part as to how we and Saudis proceed.
                            Thus, in Secretary’s message to Saqqaf at end of latest Middle East
                            trip, he indicated our willingness to send or receive high-level
                            military mission, or to send or receive comprehensive mission in
                            military, economic and technical/scientific fields, as way of getting
                            process started. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> visit
                            would clearly fit into latter category. Point is that none of these are
                            mutually exclusive. Any or all could constitute beginning of dialogue
                            preparatory to establishment of joint commissions discussed above.</p>
                        <p>8. Apart from above, you may inform Prince Sultan that revised letters of
                            offer for the Saudi navy are being forwarded and preparations are being
                            made to undertake the requested Air Force and Signal Corps surveys.</p>

                            State 48042.</p>
                        <p>Summary: Ambassador briefed Saudi officials Saturday, March 10, and
                            Sunday, March 11, on our ideas about a new <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Saudi relationship. The reaction was uniformly
                            enthusiastic. Saudi consensus was that Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> should head the Saudi team. The
                            Saudis have not yet decided whether the <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> trip to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            should proceed or follow a visit by <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            team to Saudi Arabia. All agreed, however that the first step should
                            take place very soon. All also agreed that the matter must be kept
                            secret until it is announced officially and simultaneously in Washington
                            and Riyadh. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. I saw <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Zaki Yamani</persName> in Jidda
                            evening of March 8 (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> 1137) and
                            informed him of our proposals for joint <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Saudi commissions. Isa Sabbagh and I saw Royal Advisor
                            Rashad Pharaon evening of March 9 and discussed the same matter with
                            him. He gave a full report the same evening to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>. Sabbagh and I met the
                            following morning (March 10) for an hour and a half with Prince Musa’id
                            and Mohammad aba al Khail, (Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance);
                            with Prince Sultan (Minister of Defense) also for an hour and half; with
                            Hisham Nazer (Minister of Planning) for two hours; and we spent the
                            evening with <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Kamal Adham</persName>, the
                            King’s Intelligence Advisor. Musa’id and Sultan had been briefed fully
                            by Rashad Pharaon, both on the proposal and on the King’s reaction to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>2. All the Saudis were enthusiastic; indeed they were as close to
                            euphoria as I could imagine them to be. There was no need for any “hard
                            sale” although I made little effort to conceal my own enthusiasm. All
                            the Saudis called this initiative the news they had been expecting for
                            25 years. All said that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has
                            finally recognized the importance of its interests in the Arab world;
                            all said that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Arab <pb
                                facs="0409" n="374" xml:id="pg_374"/> economies would be so closely
                            entwined that there could be no turning back and all wanted to move
                            forward as rapidly as possible.</p>
                        <p>3. I was not able to see Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> (Minister of Interior) who was in the desert on his
                            annual spring mission to the tribes, but he passed word to me that I
                            should speak to Sultan as I would to him and Sultan would then see him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said he would be back
                            in Riyadh by the end of the week and would wish to see me then.</p>
                        <p>4. Rashad Pharaon called the proposal “a new and clean chapter in <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Arab relations”. He told us on March
                            10 by phone that the King was greatly pleased by the idea and he said he
                            wished to thank Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> and particularly President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> whose “indelible imprint” is on
                            the proposal. The King hoped that this effort at Saudi-American
                            cooperation would quickly lead to a broader Arab-American cooperation
                            and to a just and durable peace in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>5. Ahamd <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Zaki Yamani</persName> said he was
                            looking forward to returning to Saudi Arabia and working with me and his
                            colleagues on the details of the proposal. He will go first to the Arab
                            Oil Ministers’ meeting in Tripoli then to <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> meeting in Vienna, and should be back in Saudi Arabia
                            by March 20.</p>
                        <p>6. Prince Musa’id spoke at length and eloquently about the restoration of
                            American position in the Middle East. He said the proposal was important
                            but the spirit behind it was more important. He said not only he and the
                            Royal family but “all thinking persons in the Arab world will consider
                            this to be a new chapter in Arab-American relations. It’s a golden
                            opportunity for the advancement of peace in the Middle East, for the
                            Arab cause and for American global interest. It must not be lost.”</p>
                        <p>7. Prince Sultan, who had been fully briefed by Rashad Pharaon about the
                            message and about the King’s reaction to it, said that this effort was
                            exactly what he and Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>
                            had urged for years.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said he spoke at length
                            about the transformation in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> policy
                            brought about by “our friend, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>, whose brilliance is matched only by his
                            mobility”. He hoped other Arab countries could be included in our
                            proposal; “it shouldn’t just be the United States and Saudi Arabia but
                            the United States and the Arabs.” He added “if the United States and
                            Saudi Arabia work together we can transform the Arab world; We can build
                            a bulwark against Communism and subversion that can never be torn down”.
                            Sultan, like all the others, thought only <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> could lead the effort on the Saudi side. He added
                            “I’ll let you in on a secret; <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> is already second most important man in the country
                            and he will be our next leader.” He said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s taking charge of this effort
                            would serve a double purpose: It would strengthen his prestige in Saudi
                            Arabia and in the Arab world, and it would assure its success.</p>
                        <pb facs="0410" n="375" xml:id="pg_375"/>
                        <p>9. Hisham Nazer listened with great attention to the explanation of the
                            proposal and then said “its good. It’s finally happened. You’ve come to
                            your senses.” Although it is difficult to judge degrees of great
                            enthusiasm, I would say that Hisham Nazer was the strongest and most
                            eloquent in his praise of the idea. He reminded me that he had studied
                            in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>; had the reputation of being
                            pro-American but was bitterly disappointed by the American action in
                            October 1973. He had told me earlier that he had resolved never to go
                            back to the States. “Now this is all changed,” he said several times
                            that “if this project goes through we will have no need for the French
                            or the British or the Japanese. The United States can do everything.
                            This is exactly what I have always wanted.”</p>
                        <p>10. I told <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> that we had no
                            intention of displacing all foreign influence in the country. This
                            probably would not be good for the Saudis or for us, but we did think we
                            could do a better job in development of Saudi Arabia than could any
                            country or combination of countries.</p>
                        <p>11. The reaction of Sayyid Omar Saqqaf, (Minister of State for Foreign
                            Affairs) from Manila (ref Manila 2788) was what I feared it would be. He
                            is peeved that this initiative took place during his absence. We
                            certainly don’t want him lobbying against the effort and I hope my two
                            messages (ref Jidda 1123 and ref Jidda 1175) will calm him somewhat. If
                            the Secretary has not sent him a similar personal message, I again urge
                            that this be done. I will see Saqqaf immediately on his return to Saudi
                            Arabia March 20, tell him how important, indeed how essential will be
                            his assistance in making the joint effort succeed.</p>
                        <p>12. The oil boycott in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was
                            rarely mentioned in the conversations. It was raised by the Saudis
                            occasionally but they were embarrassed to do so, and their references
                            were always accompanied by assurances that the boycott shall be lifted
                            immediately. They reminded me that Saudi Arabia had long favored lifting
                            the boycott; they hoped the other Arab countries could soon be brought
                            around.</p>
                        <p>13. I mentioned to each of the Saudis that we were not pushing for oil
                            barter deals and we still opposed them in principle. In any case, our
                            oil import needs will start dropping soon. I said I did not, by this,
                            wish to imply any underestimation of the importance of Saudi Arabia. We
                            knew very well that Saudi Arabia would play the major role in energy
                            supplies and world finance in the next 20 years; and it was not only
                            important but logical for it to work closely with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss></p>
                        <p>14. I point out to all the Saudis that our proposal was not a
                            disinterested, altruistic one. We expected to benefit by raising Saudi
                            and Arab standards of living and we expected our industry to benefit
                            directly and indirectly through cooperative efforts. All agreed this was
                            a sound basis for a joint approach. Hisham Nazer said particularly that
                            this <pb facs="0411" n="376" xml:id="pg_376"/> type of arrangement was
                            superior to our aid to Europe after the war and to our current aid to
                            Israel and the <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s. He said gifts
                            only arouse envy, they win no friends. He said that the mutually
                            beneficial arrangement we are proposing is not insulting or degrading
                            for the Arabs, that they know America will profit from this association
                            with Saudi Arabia and they are sure its interest in the Middle East will
                            thereby be kept alive and strengthened.</p>

                        <p>1. During meeting with Minister of Interior Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> on March 21, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> (who accompanied by
                                <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>) said that upon receiving
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s
                            instructions to propose to Saudis formation of joint US-Saudi economic
                            commissions, he had hoped to bring this information to attention of
                            Prince, before discussing it with others in <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss>. Because Prince had been unavailable, Ambassador had at
                            Prince’s direction, passed info to Prince Sultan and Royal Advisor
                            Rashad Pharaon. Ambassador assumed they had fully informed Prince about
                            our proposals (ref B).</p>
                        <p>2. Prince said he had received a written report on joint commissions and
                            extensive oral briefings on them as well. He was happy to express his
                            own gratification at US proposals, and could assure Ambassador King
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> felt the same.
                            Prince noted political relations between US and Saudi Arabia were
                            excellent and would doubtlessly remain so. He was pleased, however,
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> moving to further consolidate
                            these good relations by strengthening economic and military ties between
                            the two governments. Links we suggested could be of great importance to
                            Saudi Arabia’s own development. They would also ensure a more
                            even-handed US attitude toward the Middle East. Americans would see how
                            a just policy toward Arab world was in their own material
                            self-interest.</p>
                        <p>3. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> wanted to move
                            forward on US-Saudi economic commissions as rapidly as possible. It was
                            his and King’s belief that he should travel to United States as head of
                            high-ranking delegation to define scope and content of various projects.
                            Among advisors in Prince’s retinue would be Minister of Petroleum
                                <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName>, Minister for
                            Planning Hisham Nazer, and Minister of State for Finance Mohammed Aba
                            al-Khail.</p>
                        <p>4. Prince had hoped dates for US visit could be quickly established and
                            that he could leave for US “very soon.” For a number of reasons,
                            however, it now did not appear that he could plan on departing for US
                            before May. Prince said that Arab radicals most displeased with Saudi
                            Arabian position on oil boycott, and therefore security situation re oil
                            facilities might deserve special scrutiny in coming weeks. Prince added
                            there other matters “both great and small” on which King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> also wished to have his
                            advice during April.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said that because of
                            great importance and sensitivity <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            attached to US proposals, knowledge of these proposals has been confined
                            to small circle of the highest decision-makers. Prince believed
                            information secure in Saudi hands but added “you can never tell.” He
                            earnestly hoped that such an important and promising initiative would
                            not get off to a bad start by some premature disclosure. Accordingly,
                            for Ambassador’s private information, Prince said he had suggested to
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> that he and
                            Ambassador work out simultaneous <pb facs="0413" n="378" xml:id="pg_378"
                            /> announcement of joint commissions in US and Riyadh. His visit to US
                            in May would then give added momentum to project.</p>
                        <p>6. In response to Ambassador’s suggestion that it might be useful for
                            team of US experts to travel to Saudi Arabia to work with Saudi
                            officials for selecting and defining projects, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said he preferred that next
                            visit be by him to US. This would start project off with maximum
                            momentum and visibility; therefore, he would welcome assistance of US
                            experts during a follow-up visit to Saudi Arabia. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said he would in next few days
                            give Ambassador his (and King’s) final views on an early joint
                            announcement.</p>
                        <p>7. In response to Ambassador’s question whether Saudis would brief their
                            Arab friends in advance of joint announcement about US-Saudi economic
                            commissions, Prince believed—again because of his concern for a
                            tendentious leak—this would not be done. Instead, Saudi Arabia’s Arab
                            friends would receive a briefing simultaneously with announcement, or
                            perhaps a very short time before. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> asked if US planned to brief Japan or its European
                            allies about proposals. The Ambassador said he did not know what we
                            wished to do, but if we did wish to brief our allies we would inform the
                            Saudis in advance. He asked that the Saudis inform us if they decided to
                            inform any other Arabs.</p>
                        <p>8. Comment: Throughout the meeting with Ambassador, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> showed the same decisive manner
                            that he had in his immediately preceding remarks about Saudi Arabia’s
                            political future (ref C). If in fact <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> moves in some manner during month of April to

                                >SAG</gloss>’s policies, the significance and potential of his visit
                            to US in May could be even greater than envisaged.</p>

                            Power Structure in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>Summary: In contrast even with his behavior in recent years, King
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> is becoming less
                            flexible, more withdrawn from pragmatic daily decision making, and
                            obsessed to the point of mania with the Zionist-Communist menace. At the
                            same time, Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>, the
                            powerful and well-positioned Minister of Interior, is showing
                            unaccustomed assertiveness and self-confidence and we perceive
                            increasing evidence of support for him within the Saudi governmental
                            apparatus. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] has said to
                            the Ambassador that <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> was
                            now the “second man in the country” and “would be the next King.” The
                            passage of power from King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> to Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>—because of the King’s death or growing
                            incapacity—could be accomplished with a minimum of political drama.
                            Crown Prince <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> would not
                            effective block <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> either in
                            a practical or constitutional sense. Under <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>’s direction of Saudi affairs, <gloss

                            privileged status. [<hi rend="italic">7 lines not declassified</hi>].
                            End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. This message is highly speculative, hence the restricted distribution,
                            but I think the time has come to try to tie together some of the
                            indications we’ve received lately about a possible change in the power
                            structure in Saudi Arabia. I do not wish to suggest that a palace coup
                            is imminent, merely that we could see a reduction of the real royal
                            power and a significant increase in the power and stature of <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s decline</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> has never been an easy
                            person to work with but he has been intelligent and usually pragmatic.
                            Recently however his growing inflexibility has become a topic of
                            conversation and concern among high-ranking Saudis. [<hi rend="italic"
                                >10 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] would like to change
                            the Saudi visa policy dramatically, and eliminate entirely the religious
                            requirement for entering the country. They say they have raised this
                            with the King who adamantly refused to consider it. He is apparently
                            refusing the admis<pb facs="0415" n="380" xml:id="pg_380"/>sion of Joe
                            Kraft. He now considers this a personal issue and will not change his
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>4. The King also seems to be becoming even more religious as his age
                            increases and his arteries harden. He no longer wants Saudis to study
                            abroad: they can get all of their education in Saudi Arabia except
                            possibly graduate study. He feels that they are corrupted by life in the
                            West and they return to the Kingdom having strayed from the rigid
                            tenents of Islam. He favors increased education in the Kingdom and its
                            industrialization but he insists that the “old values” remain
                            unchanged.</p>
                        <p>5. The King’s obsession with Zionism and Communism is well known but it
                            seems to be getting far worse. The first <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> visit included the obligatory
                            Zionist-Communist conspiracy speech. The King seems to have concluded
                            that the point was made and he omitted it from the second <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> visit, but in the third
                            visit we had to hear it again. Parker Hart, former Ambassador here, was
                            recently in Riyadh (he is now a Vice President of Bechtel) and asked to
                            see the King. The King was able to rearrange his schedule to see him and
                            devoted the entire 45-minute meeting to this theme. Mr. Hart has told me
                            that he and members of the King’s entourage tried to change the subject,
                            and talk about industrialization of Saudi Arabia or other economic
                            subjects but they never succeeded in doing so. Hart left the audience
                            with no other subject having been touched. The obsession has now reached
                            the point where Arab leaders, who had previously been spared the speech,
                            are being subjected to it. Muhammad Ahmad Noman (Special Advisor to
                            Yemeni President Iriani) told me April 9 that he had that day spent an
                            hour with the King. Almost all of the time, he said, was devoted to the
                            King’s exposition of his “mother-daughter, daughter-mother” theme, i.e.
                            that Communism is the daughter (or mother) of Zionism.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> makes a miserable
                            impression on those he sees now. Saqqaf and other advisors have managed
                            to keep all newsmen away from him. I should think it unlikely that he
                            will give many more interviews. They cannot however keep Heads of State
                            or Foreign Ministers from meeting him. They’re embarrassed by the
                            meetings and they realize that nothing positive comes out of them;
                            indeed that definite harm is done the country. Yet <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> is still the absolute ruler
                            and if he says something is or is not to be done, and then refuses to
                            discuss the subject, his wishes will certainly be carried out. It is
                            still a rare official or Minister who will openly disobey the King,
                            although I suspect there will be increasing cases of orders being
                            forgotten.</p>
                        <p>7. Nonetheless we have heard no one speaking openly against King
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>. Indeed, almost all
                            meetings we have with Saudis where the King is discussed are prefaced
                            with praise of his wisdom and ability. But Saudis are beginning to talk
                            openly—or at least with me—about the succession, about the King’s
                            health, about his rigidity and his imperfect understanding of the
                            changing world.</p>

                            development. There was no question moreover that he should lead the
                            Saudi side in bilateral talks with the United States on our new
                            cooperative arrangements. He controls one of the most powerful
                            Ministries (Interior) in the country and his brother Sultan is Minister
                            of Defense. Other full brothers are in positions of great authority in
                            the country. And even non-Sudairy Princes and commoners [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] are speaking
                            much more favorably of him. Still more significant is the fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Kamal Adham</persName> (the King’s
                            brother-in-law) who previously had nothing but disdain for <persName

                                corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Zaki Yamani</persName>, whose power derives
                            exclusively from <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>, have
                            also recently praised <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> to
                            me.</p>
                        <p>9. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] told me recently that
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> was the second man in
                            the country and would be the next King. This is the first instance we
                            know of where a top Saudi [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                            has spoken to a foreigner about the succession; it is certainly the
                            first time we know of where <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>’s succession was predicted without
                            qualification.</p>
                        <p>10. The rumors of a change in power have become even more intense
                            recently, with reports that at recent Cabinet meetings <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> took control and ran the
                            meetings, with the King saying little or nothing. We aren’t sure how
                            accurate these reports are but they are circulating in both Riyadh and
                            Jidda. Possibly as an extension of these general rumors are more
                            specific ones that <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> is
                            about to assume the Prime Ministry or the Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs—portfolios currently held by <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>11. The Crown Prince</p>
                        <p>In meetings with foreigners and other Arab visitors, Crown Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> communicates an
                            impression of irrelevance that matches that of the King. His range of
                            interest appears confined to horses, falcons, Saudi Arabia’s vanishing
                            wildlife and (<hi rend="italic">in extenso</hi>) his open-heart
                            operation in Cleveland in 1972. Whether the transfer of power from
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> to <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> would involve a constitutional
                            change in the order of succession or simply involve <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s practical dominance of affairs
                            is uncertain. I do not believe, however, Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> can become either a political
                            figure in his own right, or even a point around which other elements of
                            the royal family (who perhaps do not fully support Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>) can effectively unite.</p>
                        <p>12. Effect on the United States</p>
                        <p>The United States would have very little to fear by such a change in
                            power, at least not initially. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> is very well disposed to the United States; he
                            looks on us as the guarantor of the monarchy and therefore <pb
                                facs="0417" n="382" xml:id="pg_382"/> of the family in Saudi Arabia
                            and we could expect even more advantages in the country than the very
                            considerable ones we enjoy with <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> as King. But <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> at the helm would not be an unmixed blessing.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> is no ascetic. His
                            life style is already considerably grander than that of <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>. [<hi rend="italic">7 lines
                                not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>13. [<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (10½ lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>14. I’ve had long talks with [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] about corruption in the country and the effect it
                            will have. (The Embassy is preparing a full report on the subject.) [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] has told me that he has
                            discussed the corruption problem with [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>], but they feel powerless to stop or even contain
                            it. Corruption, without a doubt, is a major and growing problem and
                            we’re going to have to decide soon what, if anything, we can do about
                            it. It will be more difficult to act when <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> comes to power.</p>
                        <p>15. The only force that might oppose a <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> move, I suppose, would be Abdulla and his National
                            Guard but they are not now and not likely soon to be a match for the
                            forces under the Sudairy brothers. And even those tied most closely to
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>, even his sons,
                            must know that there’s no hope for his improvement; that as he ages his
                            rigidity will grow, that his obsessions will become even deeper and that
                            the country could become paralyzed.</p>
                        <p>16. We seem at times to appear to believe that the King’s obsession with
                            the liberation of Jerusalem is his alone. This could lead us quickly to
                            the false conclusion that with his removal from power, in fact if not in
                            name, an Arab accommodation to Israel’s current demands about Jerusalem
                            would be made easier. It is absolutely clear however that any ruler of
                            the two holy cities of the Hejaz will have an obligation toward the
                            third, Jerusalem. This would apply to any member of the house of Saud
                            and to any commoner who might overthrow it. And we should never
                            underestimate the importance of Jerusalem to all Arabs, Muslim and
                            Christian, and to non-Arab Muslims. But what might be possible if
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> were less
                            completely in control would be a compromise on the city, a joint
                            sovereignty or a joint responsibility for the whole <gloss
                                target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> whole city of Jerusalem, or perhaps
                            under some circumstances, for just the old city and its eastern suburbs.
                            As long as <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> is in
                            complete control probably all we will hear from Riyadh on Jerusalem will
                            be a demand for the return to the status quo ante 1967.</p>
                        <p>17. Conclusion</p>
                        <p>There is probably very little we can or should do to preserve the full
                            powers of <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> or to
                            encourage the rise of <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>. No
                            matter what happens we will probably be blamed for any change but this
                            should not cause us great difficulties. There will be massive support
                            for the winner. The family has an acute sense of self-preservation and
                            the change, if it comes, will probably not be dramatic, just a gradual
                            shift <pb facs="0418" n="383" xml:id="pg_383"/> of power to <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>. The change could even be to our
                            long-term interests [<hi rend="italic">6 lines not declassified</hi>].
                            We should have time to adjust to any new ruler and, with luck, should be
                            able to exert some positive influence on him.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. As a member of the ad hoc Special Committee established by <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 198 to supervise the drafting of an
                            “initial study” concerning joint US-Saudi cooperation, I have reviewed
                            the report on this subject produced by the Interdepartmental Group
                            chaired by Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>.
                            My comments follow.</p>
                        <p>2. The study report submitted by the Interdepartmental Working Group
                            appears to be an essentially sound approach to intensifying our overall
                            relationship with Saudi Arabia. Its objectives, however, will not be
                            easy to achieve and there will be many difficult problems ahead.</p>
                        <p>3. The following would appear to be the major substantive problem
                            areas:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">The concept of simultaneously intensifying bilateral
                                relationships with Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt and encouraging
                                them, at the same time, to solidify their own triangular
                                relationships is certainly sound.</hi> A working coalition between
                            these key regional states and the US could stabilize the Middle East
                            political and economic situation and is also consistent with Israel’s
                            interests. An ever-present danger is that, because each of the regional
                            states harbors suspicions and jealousies of the other two, <pb
                                facs="0419" n="384" xml:id="pg_384"/> an aggressive individual US
                            bilateral approach could jeopardize attainment of the final multilateral
                            goal of regional stability. Thus, it is important, for instance, that
                            our actions not be interpreted as an attempt to split off Saudi Arabia
                            from the other Arab states. Likewise, our initiatives with Iran must be
                            construed in a way that will create confidence in the Arab countries
                            that we are seeking regional stability <hi rend="italic">and not
                                building up Iran to dominate the Arabs.</hi> And finally, of course,
                            the Cairo relationship must not weaken the still fragile Cairo-Riyadh
                            axis around which the mainstream of major Arab policies is beginning to
                            develop.</p>
                        <p>b. There are already some indications that Saudi expectations about the
                            fruits of the new cooperative relationship may create some problems. In
                            the security area, for instance, the Saudis appear to be focussed
                            primarily on military supply rather than a broader dialogue aimed at
                            first developing a shared conceptual outlook to identify on a rational
                            basis the points where our national security interests coincide, and
                            followed by efforts to develop specific integrated policies. Likewise,
                            in the economic field the Saudis may be interested in some large
                            investments causing problems to the US. These, of course, are natural
                            start-up problems in an exercise like this, but we will need to be
                            attentive to them.</p>
                        <p>c. A related problem is that the <hi rend="italic">Saudi bureaucracy</hi>
                            and top-level decision-making apparatus is already suffering acute <hi
                                rend="italic">indigestion from the flood of ideas, proposals and
                                plans that they are being forced to evaluate.</hi> At best we can
                            expect that our new initiatives will strain to their limits the very
                            thin crust of competent Saudi technocrats and civil servants and in some
                            areas they are likely to be overwhelmed. Added to this is the fact that
                            the Saudis are not attuned to doing business in a systematic and
                            bureaucratically formalized way and may, therefore, have considerable
                            trouble adjusting to the joint commission-working group approach. Thus
                            the success of the exercise <hi rend="italic">will depend in part on the
                                patience and sympathy</hi> with which it is implemented.</p>
                        <p>d. Our initiatives will have substantial impact on the Saudi Arabian
                            internal political scene. The Saudis have interpreted even our opening
                            gestures as being an offer by the most powerful and technologically
                            advanced society in the world to be an equal partner in tackling some of
                            their most difficult political and economic problems. The idea makes
                            them a bit dizzy. Moreover, because of the importance they attach to
                            this development, it is setting in motion significant forces within the
                            Saudi power structure. <hi rend="italic">Prince <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s hand, for example, has
                                been strengthened</hi> and a struggle is on within the inner circle
                            for inclusion in <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s
                            Washington trip team. Those chosen will be regarded as having won the
                            first important round in a contest among the present Faysal team to see
                            who will be tabbed to carry over and play big roles <pb facs="0420"
                                n="385" xml:id="pg_385"/> under the next generation of leadership.
                            This points up the importance of noting the impact which our plans will
                            have on the Saudi domestic political scene.</p>
                        <p>e. In the economic field a key element will be how our efforts are tuned
                            to Saudi preferences for ways of doing business. The
                            middleman/commission agent is a well developed institution in the Middle
                            East who cannot be eliminated from business transactions simply on the
                            grounds that they may be making some money in ways that strict Western
                            definition might regard as “corrupt.” The primary criteria for these and
                            related activities is their effectiveness in promoting US business
                            interests and their acceptability to the Saudis. Otherwise the
                            paternalistic role of defining for the Saudis, without their agreement,
                            what is “right” and “wrong” would cause difficulty. These “middlemen”
                            may act as promoters of US business or, if opposed, have a certain
                            capacity to sabotage our efforts in both the trade and investment
                            fields.</p>
                        <p>f. The relatively mild European reaction to our opening moves toward
                            greater cooperation with Saudi Arabia may be misleading. A combination
                            of preoccupation with other developments—Pompidou’s death, and <gloss
                                target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> problems, for instance—and adroit US
                            diplomacy no doubt took some of the sting out of the initial European
                            reaction. Once, however, the full extent of our plans becomes known,
                            there could be a higher European price to pay in terms of future
                            European attitudes when the issue of bilateralism versus multilateralism
                            comes up again. The closest possible continuing consultation with the
                            Europeans can help offset this kind of reaction but not entirely dispel
                            it.</p>
                        <p>4. On the procedural side, the following comments are offered:</p>
                        <p>a. [<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (14 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>b. The intelligence community can also make analytical contributions to
                            other joint commissions. It may in fact be worth considering the
                            participation of the National Intelligence Officer for Economic Affairs
                            in the annual deliberations of the Economic Commission. At the working
                            group level, the economic expertise of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss>’s Office of Economic Research should be of considerable
                            value. Several steps have already been taken to tune our collection and
                            analytical efforts to the requirements generated by this new approach to
                            Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>c. The structural pattern of setting up joint working groups to operate
                            in the period between annual sessions of the joint commissions may not
                            be feasible in all cases. Qualified Saudi personnel who can do business
                            this way will not be available in many cases; we will have to be
                            prepared to share most of the burden in between annual sessions. Setting
                            up one high level US official to coordinate and oversee our
                            contributions is wise and necessary to avoid bureaucratic confusion.</p>

                            feelings with our friends in America. We feel the need to look for
                            something beneficial in the area. Now we have seen first steps.</p>

                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> The first Arab leader I spoke to on
                            this matter was your Foreign Minister, at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>. He asked me, even before the war, to get involved. I
                            said I would, but I didn’t then know how quickly it would be.</p>

                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> No doubt what happened expedited the

                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> No doubt. What happened was not
                            possible without the war.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> The obstacles ahead will require even greater
                            efforts. I urge you to walk steadily ahead with firm steps.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> I agree. That’s our intention. We
                            are determined to keep moving.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> I was very pleased to hear statements by
                            President Asad and his Foreign Minister. The counter-efforts in Syria to
                            what you are trying to do were very powerful.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> That’s right. I believe the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and maybe Iraq, and also Libya,
                            pursued a negative role.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> Of course those elements would do their
                            utmost to whip up people and try to cause Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> to fail. But other Arab
                            leaders did just the opposite.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> That’s clear to us. We know Saudi
                            Arabia exercised a very beneficial influence.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> I mentioned that general subject to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName> was present. When President
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> took over he showed an
                            intention to turn over a new role. But circumstances didn’t permit.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> We didn’t understand <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> correctly. And conditions in
                            Israel were not right. Your visit here can be of great significance. It
                            can help establish good relations between the United States and the Arab
                            states broadly. We are beginning a similar process with Egypt, one step
                            behind Saudi Arabia. In time, we will do the same with Syria and
                            Algeria.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> knows conditions in Syria and Egypt are
                            different—more complicated in Syria. In Syria, for example, there are a
                            recognized Communist Party, Palestinians, Baathists who favor Iraq, and
                            Qadafi’s entrance into the picture by supporting elements against peace.
                            I believe the recent step in Syria has strong support, and that Asad can
                            find support for future steps. But we can’t forget that other elements
                            will try to keep Asad from this golden opportunity.</p>
                        <p>We in Saudi Arabia feel strongly that the Soviet Union is trying a pincer
                            movement around us and the Gulf. There is Iraq in the north; <pb
                                facs="0423" n="388" xml:id="pg_388"/> in the south, South Yemen. One
                            indication is that they are receiving Soviet arms far beyond their
                            needs. What for? It is foolish to say Iraq is arming only against Iran;
                            therefore, it must be against Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. Iraq realizes
                            it can’t do anything if Saudi Arabia is strong. We sense from our Arab
                            brethren their desire to get closer to Saudi Arabia because we have no
                            designs on them. Even Kuwait, which tries to emphasize its
                            self-sufficiency, turns to Saudi Arabia at the first sign of a threat.
                            My conviction is the stronger Saudi Arabia is, the more it can
                            contribute to stability in the region.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> It is our firm view that a strong
                            Saudi Arabia is in the interest of the United States and will contribute
                            to peace and stability in the area. The United States would never be
                            indifferent to any threat to the Kingdom from the north or the south. We
                            look with favor on Saudi Arabia’s playing a stabilizing role in the
                            Gulf. We count on it to play that role. In your meetings at the Defense
                            Department tomorrow, you will find your requests are well received. If
                            not, let me know. There are no problems—(jocularly) except <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>’s normal problems.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> I am very pleased to hear this from Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> I have instructed my associates.
                            Your visit is of signal importance, not only to the United States but to
                            our relations with the entire Arab world. I am sure you will find the
                            President expressing the same sentiments. As you are our oldest friend
                            in the Arab world, it is right that we should make our first new special
                            effort with Saudi Arabia. It can be an example to all other Arab
                            countries as well.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> It is very pleasing to Saudi Arabia to hear
                            this. It will give me double pleasure to convey this to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Back to the Gulf: we in Saudi Arabia have no desire to expand our own
                            area, in the Gulf or elsewhere. That’s why our Gulf brethren are at
                            ease. We have no thought of aggressing against anyone, nor of using arms
                            against anyone. Rather it is our intent to bring about stability. When
                            Iraq or others realize Saudi Arabia is strong, they will think
                            twice.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> We have confidence in the
                            stabilizing role of the Kingdom. We have no hesitation in meeting its
                            needs.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> It is nowhere in our policy that we will
                            aggress. We need stability in the area. Iraq may want to swallow up
                            Kuwait, or open the way to external Communists; we have no such desire.
                            I will mention one incident. Two days after Iraq attacked Kuwait, South
                            Yemen sent planes to bomb Saudi Arabia. We concluded they wanted tension
                            in Saudi Arabia, and in the south, so that we would be unable to help
                            Kuwait in the north. King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> realized that the South Yemen action was intended
                            as a diversion to take attention away from Iraq. <pb facs="0424" n="389"
                                xml:id="pg_389"/> He therefore ordered that we not pay too much
                            attention to the South Yemeni bombing raids because we did not want to
                            satisfy Iraq.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> As I told His Majesty, we want to
                            work in the closest cooperation with the Kingdom on South Yemen
                            policy.</p>

                            touch on matters of bilateral interest and on Arab matters.</p>

                            to call on him Friday afternoon at 5:00 p.m. to review where we stand. I
                            hope His Highness will allow me to accompany him to the plane as he
                            departs. We will also have a chance to meet in his call on the

                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> I am very thankful. My visit here stems from
                            a mutual desire to see how our interests can be strengthened.</p>

                            stated how greatly he and the Saudi leadership looked forward to the
                            President’s forthcoming trip. He further expressed his congratulations
                            to the President and to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> for their successful efforts in the Middle
                            East.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> stated how much he looked forward to
                            his first visit to Saudi Arabia. It had been necessary to cancel an
                            earlier visit planned for 1967. The President recalled that his
                            friendship for the Saudis went back 20 years to the Eisenhower
                            Administration when the President attended a dinner at the Saudi Arabian
                            Embassy for King Saud (1957). The President expressed his judgment that
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> was one of the
                            wisest leaders in the world because the scope of his concerns went
                            beyond purely domestic and bilateral issues to problems of the Middle
                            East and indeed the world. The President expressed his appreciation for
                            Saudi support during the difficult negotiations of the past months. He
                            added how important it would be that Saudi Arabia play a key role in the
                            Persian Gulf in the future in view of the instability of new governments
                            in that area. The President stated that he particularly looked forward
                            to receiving King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s
                            views on the Gulf States. For the moment, however, the President was
                            pleased at the opportunity presented by Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s visit to explore with the
                            Departments of Defense, Treasury and State the outlines that had been
                            sketched by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            for bilateral cooperation. The President expressed the view that our
                            Cabinet officials would listen to Saudi interests with deep sympathy.
                                <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName></hi> stated his willingness to cut through
                            bureaucratic obstacles to avoid their impeding the cooperation.</p>
                        <pb facs="0426" n="391" xml:id="pg_391"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> emphasized how important a role was
                            to be played by a stable Saudi Arabia in building a permanent peace in
                            the area. The President stated that his sentiments and attitude of
                            support for Saudi Arabia were a product of his respect for the Saudi
                            leadership and King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> in
                            particular and their leadership in the area. He expressed the view “oil
                            can not hold people together but friendship and respect can.” He
                            concluded by saying that his attitude towards Saudi Arabia and toward
                            the Saudi people was based on friendship and respect.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName></hi> agreed with the President’s statement and
                            noted that US-Saudi friendship went back to a time long before oil
                            became a major issue. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> stressed that friendship and mutual interests with
                            the United States would be the basis for Saudi Arabian foreign policy.
                            He said that this was true not because of the benefits it would bring
                            but as a correct end in itself. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> stated that his country had always admired the US
                            position. He added further that King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> had promised that US-Saudi relations would always
                            develop on solid ground. He expressed the further viewpoint that had
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s judgment been
                            followed in the Arab world between 1960 and 1967 that things might have
                            turned out differently. <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> noted that
                            while he had not been in office he believed that previous Presidents had
                            acted with good faith. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> stressed that Saudi antagonism to communism had
                            been correct from the start and that it had failed because the Saudi
                            people abhorred communism. Further, the Saudi system of government is
                            based upon as broad a base as possible and operates under the precept
                            that the government’s authority should derive from the consent of the
                            governed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName></hi> stated that his directive from King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> was to make clear that the
                            King intended for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi
                            relationship to be based on mutual relations regardless of the winds
                            which may be blowing; that currently friendship was being broadened at
                            the highest level and that already the two countries are embarking on
                            important innovations.</p>
                        <p>He added further that the King had spared no effort with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> in order to bring
                            out new and beneficial things in our bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Gulf States, <hi rend="italic">Prince <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName></hi> stated that Saudi
                            policy is clear. Friendship with the people of the Gulf States and their
                            government is cherished; Saudi Arabia harbors nothing against them but
                            seeks only peace, stability and progress as they develop. He added that
                            occasional difficulty had arisen as a result of the shenanigans launched
                            from the south and north. He believed that prevention represented the
                            best approach and that the best prescription was a strong Saudi Arabia,
                            in order that potential opponents would recognize that they had to deal
                            seriously with Saudi Arabia. The Saudi army needs to be suffi<pb
                                facs="0427" n="392" xml:id="pg_392"/>ciently strong to defend itself
                            and its friends outside the country. It is the King’s intention to keep
                            the army well-equipped with what it needs, but never to use it as an
                            aggressive force. Saudi Arabia is not looking for conquest; she is
                            looking for respect. The Prince stated that if Saudi Arabia were strong
                            it would be respected, but that if it were a jelly fish then others
                            would go around it. He expressed his personal conviction that in
                            Washington, Saudi requirements, both military and civilian, would be
                            met.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the President’s visit, <hi rend="italic">Prince <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName></hi> made clear that it was
                            considered an important event which King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> and the government very much anticipated.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> reiterated that his relationship
                            with Saudi Arabia had its origin many years ago and that his respect for
                            the people in the area was well-known. The President expressed regret
                            that he was unable to visit Saudi Arabia in 1967 when he had been
                            required to stop his travel in Morocco when the war broke out. He
                            recalled the meeting with King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> in the late ‘60’s, however, before his election
                            to the Presidency. He particularly appreciated that occasion since it
                            had no official meaning and was not required.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> referred to his speech (Naval
                            Academy Commencement Address) in which he described what détente meant
                            and what it did not mean. He referred to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s strong aversion to
                            Communism and stated that the United States agreed completely. He added
                            that when it came to the internal affairs of the Soviet Union, however,
                            that we had very little latitude for changing that. Similarly, the
                            United States would take a strong stand on the right of all countries,
                            as for example Saudi Arabia, to maintain their own systems without
                            outside interference from anyone. <hi rend="italic">The President</hi>
                            stressed that détente did not mean a privileged sanctuary in Communist
                            states, and open hunting in non-Communist states, but rather that it
                            provided a basis for dialogue in order to avoid nuclear conflict. The
                            President made clear that the United States would defend the right of
                            nations to maintain their independence from outside aggression over or
                            under their borders.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName></hi> stated that it was in this spirit
                            that the United States had agreed to work against Communist pressure
                            from both South Yemen and Iraq. The United States was developing an
                            action program which should absorb some of South Yemen’s energies within
                            that country. <hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                    >Fahd</persName></hi> expressed his pleasure at these remarks
                            and stated that it was good to know that the Saudis and Americans would
                            be working together, not only for each other, but for the peace and
                            welfare of all people in the area. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> then stated that he did not wish to delay the
                            President by overextending the meeting. <hi rend="italic">The
                                President</hi> noted that a number of Congressmen had been invited
                            to lunch in order that the closeness of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Saudi relations would be made <pb facs="0428" n="393"
                                xml:id="pg_393"/> clear within the Congress. There would be an
                            opportunity for toasts and for press coverage with pictures. <hi

                                >Fahd</persName></hi> replied that it was a doubly good omen to have
                            the opportunity to see the President twice in one day. The President
                            confirmed that Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Your Royal Highness, it is a great satisfaction for me and my colleagues
                            to welcome you here and to have this first working session on
                            Saudi-United States cooperation. I have had the privilege of visiting
                            Saudi Arabia four times. One cannot visit your country without
                            developing a deep personal affection and without becoming convinced of
                            the feeling of friendship which we want to reciprocate. We believe the
                            last six months have marked a turning point in United States relations
                            in the Middle East. We have taken seriously the advice of our friends
                            which was offered for many years. We recognize that the United States
                            has special responsibilities to contribute to peace in the area. We
                            believe that an important first step has been taken but we want to
                            assure His Royal Highness and His Majesty, King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>, that we will continue this
                            course of action.</p>
                        <p>In this context, we believe there is a need for a new relationship
                            between the United States and Arab states that will go beyond the
                            Arab-Israel problem. This relationship should concern itself with how to
                            maintain peace in the area and set an example for other countries in the
                            area. For this reason, all my colleagues and I and the President
                            consider it appropriate that we start with Saudi Arabia in view of the
                            long and friendly relations which we have had with your country. This
                            new relationship can be significant because the principles and practices
                            that we develop together can set examples for similar commissions we set
                            up in other Arab nations.</p>
                        <p>As Your Royal Highness knows, we have announced that we are going to have
                            a joint commission with Egypt and we are discussing one with Algeria and
                            Syria. We look forward to a new era of cooperation with the Arab nations
                            and the United States. We are therefore happy that the first detailed
                            discussion for joint cooperation should take place between the United
                            States and Saudi Arabia. Now before moving to more concrete topics, I
                            wonder if His Royal Highness has any comments.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            want to thank Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> for
                            his apt remarks and full explanation of the purposes of this
                            cooperation. I want to echo his remarks of our desire for close
                            relations with the United States. It is particularly apt that a new
                            chapter in relations is being envisioned <pb facs="0430" n="395"
                                xml:id="pg_395"/> between the United States and the Arab world. It
                            should be a shining and glorious one.</p>
                        <p>With reference to relations between the United States and the Arab world
                            over the last few years, being marked with stagnation, this has not been
                            true as far as bilateral United States-Saudi relations are concerned. We
                            were following amical and sound relations with the United States before.
                            We believe the whole Arab world will come to realize that Saudi Arabia
                            was moving in the right direction and that it will come to recognize
                            that this policy will have realized a good purpose.</p>
                        <p>We greatly appreciate your untiring efforts which you have spent in
                            bringing about a disengagement between Egypt and Israel and Syria and
                            Israel. We believe the untiring efforts of Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> will be proven in history to
                            have been of great benefit to the entire world and for peace in general.
                            Although we appreciate the fact that from here on, there are bound to be
                            difficulties in achieving further progress, we do not think these will
                            be insurmountable if wisdom and patience is applied.</p>
                        <p>As to the invitation to come to the United States and meet with the
                            President and the Secretary of State, I would like to express my
                            appreciation and to say that we come with the spirit of wanting to
                            develop our relations in a way that will be beneficial to both our
                            countries. I consider our meeting today not as an ordinary meeting for
                            negotiation—not the kind of adversary relationship the Secretary is used
                            to and where he has to pull here and pull there—(laughter) but where we
                            come in the spirit of friendship.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            I appreciate your kind remarks about the progress of negotiations but I
                            would like to point out that the road to Syria was opened by His
                            Majesty’s government during my first visit to Saudi Arabia and during my
                            discussions with the Syrians, I could detect the quiet and subtle
                            influence of His Majesty’s government on these discussions.</p>
                        <p>The spirit of friendship that His Royal Highness described has animated
                            our attitude. We are approaching a common problem. We will seek a common
                            solution. As the President said to His Royal Highness this morning, if
                            projects tend to be stifled by bureaucracy, the President hopes that His
                            Highness will deal directly with him or with me. I would like to tell
                            His Royal Highness that in coming from a much more ancient civilization
                            than our own, that he will have to be patient with our peculiarities.
                            One of these peculiarities is that each agency of the United States
                            government has a small Political Science Department (laughter) dedicated
                            to the proposition that the only ones who know what is better for others
                            are Americans (more laughter).</p>
                        <p>We have attempted to eliminate these political science discussions from
                            the Department—but if you run into officials who think they <pb
                                facs="0431" n="396" xml:id="pg_396"/> know Saudi Arabia’s interests
                            better than you do, please let us know and we will try to straighten
                            this out.</p>
                        <p>You will be meeting separately with the Secretary of Defense and the
                            Secretary of Treasury on security and economic cooperation. Do not let
                            the Defense Department sell you an aircraft carrier (laughter). With
                            your permission, we might discuss our general approach and the details
                            we would like to take up at these two meetings. With respect to defense
                            cooperation, we have had the privilege of an exchange of views on a
                            number of occasions. The basic attitude of the United States is that we
                            consider the security of Saudi Arabia as central to the security of the
                            Middle East and especially of the Persian Gulf area. The United States
                            considers that a strong Saudi Arabia presents a threat to no one but can
                            be of benefit to area stability. Therefore, I am confident that you will
                            find great receptivity in responding to what is needed for your internal
                            security as well as defense.</p>
                        <p>We believe that a strong Saudi Arabia can exercise a beneficial influence
                            on the small principalities in the Persian Gulf. We will be prepared to
                            present to Your Royal Highness a strategic analysis of the threats which
                            we may both face in the area during your visit and during the
                            President’s visit. The United States will certainly never be indifferent
                            to pressure that may be exerted on the Kingdom from the north or the
                            south. I would like to repeat what I already had the opportunity to say
                            in Riyadh and yesterday to His Royal Highness. We would be prepared to
                            concert our policies for countries like South Yemen and Iraq.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the economic dimension, in the past, this has been
                            dominated by the oil front. But as the President pointed out today, the
                            purpose of His Royal Highness’ visit is not primarily to discuss oil
                            policy but an era of cooperation between the United States and Saudi
                            Arabia which means we must emphasize those interests of primary concern
                            to Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>As the special session of the General Assembly recently made clear, we
                            are moving into a new economic relationship. We are struck by Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName>’s speech there on the
                            use of gas to help meet the world’s fertilizer production. This is a
                            project which the United States would be prepared to support and perhaps
                            begin by a survey of fertilizer needs and production capabilities and
                            what might be provided in the way of technical help.</p>
                        <p>We understand that a serious obstacle in development is the shortage of
                            manpower with the requisite technical skills. To help Saudi Arabia meet
                            its immediate needs, we have prepared a draft technical cooperation
                            agreement between our two countries. Specifically, in our economic
                            discussions we could consider:</p>
                        <p>—cooperation in the development and industrialization of Saudi
                            Arabia;</p>
                        <pb facs="0432" n="397" xml:id="pg_397"/>
                        <p>—cooperation in international investment and finance;</p>
                        <p>—cooperation in techniques of agricultural production;</p>
                        <p>—cooperation in technology education and transfer and in scientific
                            research and development.</p>
                        <p>In the industrialization field, in addition to the Joint Commission, we
                            could consider joint working groups between our two countries, a
                            government sponsored economic council with top-level private <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> participants to work with Saudi
                            participants on facilitating cooperation, and perhaps a Saudi-United
                            States Development Council that could get engaged in a more detailed
                            review of economic proposals. We will make specific proposals in the
                            foreign investment area and in the agricultural area.</p>
                        <p>In the energy area, we have no specific proposals but will be prepared to
                            exchange information on future demand and supply, but we will do that
                            with the attitude that we will require technical assistance from
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> (laughter).</p>
                        <p>In the scientific field, we will again suggest various approaches that
                            have occurred to us in which we might assist in the development of Saudi
                            technical manpower, in the development of Saudi educational and
                            technical institutions, in strengthening the Saudi government’s
                            capabilities for managing technical and scientific institutions, and in
                            the selection of major industrialization projects that might be
                            implemented in the future.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that there will not be time during this visit to agree on
                            these projects. We are putting them forward to show our attitude and to
                            indicate our approach. What might emerge is setting up working groups
                            for each area that His Royal Highness thinks cooperative endeavors might
                            be possible which might be given fairly short deadlines. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> will be in charge of
                            the Economic and Technical Commission and we are thinking that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> might be head of
                            the Defense Commission. Of course, I will maintain my overall interest.
                            Having had the privilege of visiting Saudi Arabia on four occasions, I
                            will not let any of my colleagues get ahead of me (laughter). This then
                            is our general approach and I wonder if Your Royal Highness feels this
                            is the right approach or if you have a different method of
                            proceeding.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> If
                            I were to speak, I could not have done it a shade better than Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. It appears that
                            he read my thoughts before I opened my mouth. His explanation was very
                            adequate and his suggestion to set up working groups a wise one. With
                            the knowledge that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            and I will help keep a watchful eye, we will see that the work is done.
                            The key responsible Saudi officials have heard Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s explanations and I have no
                            doubt that we will all agree to press on to start work in earnest. We
                            can only discuss in generalities at this time and we are looking forward
                            to seeing results.</p>
                        <pb facs="0433" n="398" xml:id="pg_398"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Then if it is agreeable, there will be a detailed discussion on defense
                            in the Pentagon.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            Yes, this is certainly indicated and we look forward to the discussions
                            this afternoon.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            I have reviewed these proposals. Tomorrow, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> will present a detailed review on
                            subjects which I have sketched. We will be prepared, however, if His
                            Royal Highness wishes, to have a preliminary discussion with our
                            economic and scientific people—we leave this up to you but the
                            discussions could start this afternoon.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            That would be very useful.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Then Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName> could be in
                            touch with your officials. I do not think we can cover all the subjects
                            in two or three hours tomorrow. You will have to be careful with him. He
                            was our energy czar for a while during which time he insisted we call
                            him “His Majesty” (laughter). You may wish to indicate who should talk
                            to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName>.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> It
                            should be Ministers <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName>,
                            Nazer and Aba al Khail.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            With <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> alone, we will need
                            at least three on our side. You could start at 4:30 in Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName>’s office and discuss
                            scientific and technological subjects tomorrow.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            Agreed, I think the next thing to think about is the need to issue some
                            kind of statement. We would like to discuss a statement.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Our thinking is on the identical track. Would you want to publish it at
                            the end of the visit.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            Yes.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            We believe the statement should be in some detail so that others can see
                            the scope of this cooperation. Would Your Royal Highness wish to
                            designate who would do this, who could work with some of my
                            colleagues.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            Yes. This could be done after the meeting on security, perhaps this
                            evening.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> could represent our
                            side. We should also have a representative from Treasury and
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            Deputy Foreign Minister Mas’ud and Legal Advisor Kosaibi will be
                            detailed to discuss this this evening.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Roy, will you take the initiative to do this? Since we have to get ready
                            to go to the White House, are there any other topics you would like to
                            discuss?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            am putting my script back into my pocket because you have covered
                            everything.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            This shows how good our intelligence is (laughter).</p>
                        <pb facs="0434" n="399" xml:id="pg_399"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi>
                            That would be true if I had prepared the script yesterday but I did it
                            today (more laughter) but the proof is that we have come here on the
                            same wave length, we have compatibility.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Yes, and we have had the opportunity to discuss this before. On behalf
                            of my colleagues, I want to thank you. I believe we may be contributing
                            to a historic evolution of relations between nations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>:</hi> I
                            want to thank you on behalf of my colleagues for your warm cordiality
                            and the understanding shown by the United States for Saudi interests and
                            to let you know that we too are conscious of what is best for United
                            States interests. I would like to go back to what I said at the
                            outset—that we see this as a meeting among friends and this short
                            meeting has shown that this is truly so. And with your permission, I
                            would like to say genuinely how we all feel about your Ambassador, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName>, in whom we have the
                            highest regard. He is the best kind of representative you could have
                            sent there. It would have been better to say this without having him in
                            the room but I wanted to say this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            We are very pleased you feel this way. He gets to be a nuisance at times
                            because he fights for Saudi concerns with a fanatical intensity
                            (laughter) but the results are there. Thank you.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_401"/> Arabia seeks to strengthen its forces for
                            defensive purposes, not for aggression, while bearing in mind that a
                            power which cannot defend itself effectively will not be taken very
                            seriously. For Saudi Arabia to be better-equipped to defend itself will
                            be to our mutual advantage. Saudi Arabia would not have sought to
                            strengthen its forces if the Soviets had not looked for advantage in our
                            area, taking advantage of certain “open doors and windows” as has been
                            evidenced in the Soviets’ showering arms upon the <gloss

                            expensive goal of arming our armed forces is an indication of our
                            recognition of our needs. The Soviets have supplied modern weapons,
                            tanks and over 300 aircraft to Iraq and have completely rearmed six
                            divisions.</p>
                        <p>Why is Iraq making itself so strong? Obviously this is not being done to
                            stand up to Iran; this would not be rational, so its purposes are
                            against Saudi Arabia and other states of the peninsula. There is a
                            serious intent to squeeze Saudi Arabia in a pincers movement from the
                            north and from the south; “people who don’t wish us well want Saudi
                            Arabia engaged by Iraq on the one hand and the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> on the other in order to force Saudi Arabia to turn in

                            say that these are the reasons why Saudi Arabia seeks to strengthen its
                            armed forces with US help. We fully realize this cannot happen
                            overnight, but given US good will, based on what we have already been
                            told, we see no permanent obstacle to our goal.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss></hi> continued
                            that in view of the need to develop technical expertise, training is
                            necessary. Saudi Arabia wanted as many of its officers as possible to
                            come to the US for training. Hardware can be purchased anywhere, but
                            what is important is the US desire to help Saudi Arabia. Cash is not the
                            problem. There is a great difference between one who says “Here are the
                            arms—pay me,” and one who wants us to plan wisely, giving evidence of
                            heartfelt concern. It is most important that stability continue in the
                            area. It would be bad for all if an imbalance were to develop. The Saudi
                            Arabian Government must protect its people. The emphasis must be on the
                            coordination of planning together on the concept of a program to assist
                            Saudi Arabia—a “partnership.” <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_HRH_1"
                                    >HRH</gloss></hi> emphasized the human element of training; also
                            technical expertise, not just hardware but help in coordinating Saudi
                            plans; training in Saudi Arabia and training in the US; experts as
                            necessary in Saudi Arabia. An example of what he would like to see
                            happen in this respect <pb facs="0437" n="402" xml:id="pg_402"/> is
                            provided by Iran, which could not have modernized its forces so
                            effectively without US help. He has the strong conviction that what has
                            been done for Iran can be done for Saudi Arabia. Both can work for peace
                            and stability in the region. We need to improve our units quickly. “In
                            concluding my remarks, I would like to say that we regard these meetings
                            as talks between friends in which we open our hearts; they are not
                            negotiations between adversaries, but discussions between friends.”</p>

                            observed that <gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss>’s words were words of
                            wisdom and well-chosen, and that the prospects which he outlined
                            represent a vision which we share. For our part it is an obligation, but
                            it is more than an obligation; it is a pleasant duty as well. <gloss
                                target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss> has presented a strategic view which
                            we share, involving not only Saudi Arabia but all the Persian Gulf area.
                            With respect to the Soviet Union we recognize that it has both a
                            material national interest and a missionary thrust on behalf of the
                            communist structure. For this reason the US feels it must maintain a
                            strategic balance both worldwide and regionally in the area. The Soviets
                            must feel that there are no regions which they can penetrate, no plums.
                            There must be a regional balance in every part of the world. This is
                            most fundamental in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>To maintain the balance, we need recourse to the human spirit; that is,
                            the will and determination to which <gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss>
                            has referred. The human spirit has preeminence and where harmony
                            prevails and the spirit of mutual cooperation exists, all things are
                            possible.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss></hi> said that
                            training and doctrine were more important than hardware.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss></hi> stated
                            that we are prepared to train large numbers of Saudi personnel here and
                            in Saudi Arabia as fits Saudi desires. <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1"
                                >SecDef</gloss> noted that <gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss>
                            spoke of the preeminence of training over mere hardware in providing
                            assistance. We share that concept. <gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss>
                            appropriately states that there should be a plan and notion of how to
                            use the hardware and men trained to use that hardware. In assisting the
                            Saudi Arabian Government, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            wishes to treat Saudi resources with exactly the same care as we would
                            our own. Such assistance should be cost-effective and suitable to Saudi
                            needs. We are prepared, therefore, to treat hardware as something that
                            will follow development of a strategic concept which treats the long
                            term needs of Saudi Arabia. But first, we must have a plan and we must
                            complete the advisory report. <gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss> has
                            spoken with words of great eloquence and wisdom and we are prepared to
                            enter into a comradely relationship in which the human relationship is
                            effective and suitable from the standpoint of our two governments. <hi

                            that good training is at the heart of the problem and basic to the
                            strengthening of the Saudi Armed Forces. As <hi rend="italic"><gloss
                                    target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss></hi> had already told the
                            Saudis, the determination of training in the US or in Saudi Arabia, or
                            both, is up to the Saudi Arabian Government. We are well aware that in
                            some instances, the Saudi Arabian Government may wish to send personnel
                            here; in other cases to train in Saudi Arabia; we are agreeable to this.
                            The key words here are Saudi self-sufficiency; the sooner this is
                            reached the better we like it. (NOTE: <hi rend="italic"><gloss

                            must be combined, training in the US and to have military technical

                            It is the best path to follow; when companies get into the act they must
                            look to their material gain as their number one consideration. This is

                            and Coastal Defense forces. All civil defense elements also need
                            rebuilding and reequipping. It would be appreciated if the team could
                            include these elements in its study. The Saudis would prefer that the
                            study be all-encompassing. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1"

                            neighbors. In the former Trucial States he noted, for example, that
                            happily they were developing with stability following the departure of
                            the British. We are aware, too, of the Saudis’ concern, a concern we
                            share, regarding the insurrectionary movements in Oman. We commend the
                            Saudis for their vigorous attention to that problem which is in their
                            interest. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss></hi>
                            said that if he seemed to emphasize internal security, “our brethern in

                            then we can provide such assistance to our brethren in the Gulf in the

                            important that the Gulf States look to Saudi Arabia and not across the

                            would agree 100 percent. “This is because they are at ease with us, a

                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> had written
                            to him about one area of concern, the problem of estimating the cost of
                            cases. He had put forth Prince Sultan’s views very strenuously indeed.
                            To the extent that cost estimates contain erroneous data, <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> can take corrective steps. However, a
                            problem beyond <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> control is that of
                            inflation and the deterioration in the purchasing power of Western
                            currencies. We feel it more painfully than the nations we are supplying.
                            The general rise in prices is also reflected in Saudi Arabia’s exports,
                            as well. We hope we can do better in estimating costs but until

                            introduced certain regional aspects of Middle East security: Soviet
                            influence in Somalia and developments in Ethiopia. As strategic concepts
                            are developed for the region, these countries in adjacent areas have a
                            major impact. Saudi Arabia can do more for them than can the US. Saudi
                            Arabia has good relations with these countries and can help enormously.
                            Today the Soviet impact in Somalia could well be greater than in Iraq.
                                <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss></hi> said the
                            Saudis would always welcome being advised of developments in the region
                            and that His Majesty King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> would be particularly pleased. Of course, Saudi
                            Arabia did not want to see problems in Somalia and wouldn’t “take it
                            smiling” because of Somali relations with the Soviets. <hi rend="italic"
                                    ><gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss></hi> recalled a visit to
                            Somalia, a poor country, a few years ago and the Somali President’s
                            visit to Saudi Arabia this year. <hi rend="italic"><gloss
                                    target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss></hi> had discussed with him the
                            problem of the growth of Communist influence there. As Somalia had
                            become a member of the Arab League, this emboldened Saudi Arabia to
                            discuss Communist influence in Somalia. He had told the President that
                            this influence was harmful to all Arabs. Perhaps the US and Saudi Arabia
                                <pb facs="0441" n="406" xml:id="pg_406"/> could agree upon a rescue
                            operation to pull Somalia out of the mire. <hi rend="italic"><gloss
                                    target="#t_DepSecDef_1">DepSecDef</gloss></hi> stated that we
                            would welcome this and that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1"
                                >Akins</persName> could continue discussion of this in Saudi
                            Arabia.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss></hi> then
                            made the point that in this area it is even more important to have a
                            plan in order to avoid an abortive effort. In developing the armed
                            forces, if mistakes are made due to lack of planning it only costs
                            money. But in such an area as was being discussed, mistakes would cost
                            much more than money. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_HRH_1"
                                    >HRH</gloss></hi> termed <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1"
                                >SecDef</gloss>’s observation “absolutely correct.” Because of their
                            closeness to the people of Somalia, the Saudis could perhaps wield
                            influence, but only if supplied with material support. <hi rend="italic"

                            agreements. He stated that the Emir had told him of the need for a
                            regional concept and had referred to mutual interests with the United

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss></hi> then asked
                                <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss> for enlightenment on
                            Soviet strategy in the area. <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss>
                            said that the reopening of the Suez Canal would have great impact and
                            symbolic value for Egypt, a sister Arab state. It would provide a
                            greater income for Egypt and restore an asset so closely associated with
                            Egyptian pride. There is no question that it has the disadvantage of
                            allowing the Soviet fleet to move rapidly from the Black Sea to the
                            Indian Ocean. It would shorten the Soviet line of communications from
                            10,000 miles to 2,000. While the presence and demonstration of Soviet
                            power will likely be a source of psychological pressure at least, we
                            hope it will not constitute more than psychological pressure on the area
                            nations. For this reason we have requested funds from Congress for a
                            facility at Diego Garcia, not because we wish to station forces there
                            but so that if the Soviets enhanced their presence, we could enhance our
                            presence and neutralize Soviet influence or pressure which could become

                            the local conflict of which we were so painfully aware. Aspects of that

                            area nation, so we are most concerned about the orientation of Iraq.
                            Those are the primary considerations. We do not see a general war. <hi

                            prepared by the Intelligence Community in preparation for the visit.
                            However, most of its conclusions have been reflected in the remarks of

                                >SecDef</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_DepSecDef_1">DepSecDef</gloss>,
                            and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MT_1">Moorer</persName>. <hi

                            observed that this is flattering, but similarity does not mean that
                            these conclusions are correct. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HS_1">Hoskinson</persName></hi> said he would merely
                            supplement the earlier statements. Regarding the Soviet role and threat
                            in the region, the Soviets would one day like to control or deny the
                            flow of energy resources to Europe and Japan. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is not in a position to do so today
                            but we must keep this potential threat in mind in assessing their
                            activities in the coming years. <hi rend="italic"><gloss
                                    target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss></hi> made the observation
                            that a worldwide balance of power is essential to containment all over
                            the world. The US believes in the self-determination of nations, a view
                            which is not shared by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. <hi
                                rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS_1"
                                >Hoskinson</persName></hi> said the Soviets will be particularly
                            interested in strategic areas, in the choke points in the area. A good
                            example today is the Soviet intelligence ship and two minesweepers
                            operating in the Strait of Hormuz. This is the first time that the
                            Soviets have moved an intelligence collector this close to the Gulf. As
                            to the political situation in the Gulf itself, we are encouraged that
                            the smaller states seem to have weathered the quote British withdrawal
                            unquote fairly well. Saudi Arabia is in a better position to judge than
                            we, but it seems to us that important changes could occur when the
                            adaptability of these regimes is put to the test. Iraq poses the
                            greatest potential threat in the Gulf, in the short run. At present the
                            Iraqis seem to be preoccupied. There was the October War and the
                            difficulties with the Kurds and the clashes with Iran. But it would not
                            be surprising if they renew their threat to Kuwait, particularly against
                            the two islands. Iraq continues to give arms support to dissident
                            groups, as does the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>. Bahrain may
                            become a problem as regards its capability of coping with emerging
                            social changes. In many respects, this is the most worrisome situation
                            in the area. As regards Oman: Oman receives special attention because of
                            its strategic location and also, should Sultan Qabus’s efforts to mod<pb
                                facs="0443" n="408" xml:id="pg_408"/>ernize and put down the Dhofar
                            Rebellion fail, this would have serious repercussions for both Saudi
                            Arabia and the US. The British say the tide of war in Dhofar has turned
                            and that the rebels will be pushed out in the eastern and central areas
                            and largely in the west by the end of the year.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss></hi>
                            observed that one aspect of the problem in Oman was that outside parties
                            are involved there, outsiders in the sense that they are outsiders to
                            the area, that is the British and Iranians. The Sudan is prepared to
                            provide military units in Oman. To the extent that Arab countries can
                            provide such help it is better than foreign forces, such as British and
                            Iranian. If the concept of multi-Arab support for Qabus has appeal and
                            appeals to you, it may be desirable that Saudi Arabia express its
                            support for that kind of approach. <hi rend="italic"><gloss
                                    target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss></hi> replied that Saudi assistance
                            to Oman is our duty and a necessity. This in itself does not obviate the
                            need for sound coordination with Saudi Arabia and US aid at some time.
                            This aid to Oman could be provided directly or through Saudi Arabia.
                            What is important is that we help Oman. It would be excellent to have
                            Arab nations help while US helps them. <hi rend="italic"><gloss
                                    target="#t_DepSecDef_1">DepSecDef</gloss></hi> observed that in
                            the interest of Saudi Arabia, it is better that there not be “overkill;”
                            it would not be in Saudi interest to have a lot of foreign forces in
                            Oman. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss></hi>
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_DepSecDef_1">DepSecDef</gloss></hi>
                            then observed that these kinds of exchanges with Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> were very important to the

                                >Moorer</persName> to understand the views of Saudi Arabia. <hi

                            the whole discussion was very useful and helpful. It was a discussion of
                            friends among friends.</p>

                            that the tide had turned in Dhofar, we think the insurgency is certainly
                            not over, would be difficult to quell, and could take many years as we
                            have learned from our experience. <hi rend="italic"><gloss
                                    target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss></hi> agreed. <hi rend="italic">Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HS_1">Hoskinson</persName></hi> said that
                            Oman has an internal security problem in the northeastern part of the
                            country as well. As regards the two Yemens, we are seriously concerned
                            by the situation of the two Yemens. It would appear that the <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>, like Oman, cannot by itself fend off
                            incursions from the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, which is
                            assisted by the Soviets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS_1"
                                >Hoskinson</persName> then said that he would like to make a point
                            as regards regional cooperation in the Gulf and Red Sea areas. First,
                            the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran is of fundamental
                            importance to the security of the area as a whole. All of us would be
                            losers if Saudi relations with Iran were to degenerate into
                            confrontation. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1"
                                    >SecDef</gloss></hi> interjected to say that we fervently share
                            that point of view. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HS_1"
                                    >Hoskinson</persName></hi> said that Saudi Arabia and the US
                            also share a strong interest in the Red Sea Basin area, as noted by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>. Bab El Mandeb in
                            the middle of the region will be of increasing importance, especially

                            explanation of the strategic situation is commendable; however, I wish
                            to comment on Iran. The Saudi relationship with Iran is an old and
                            strong one. We fully realize that for all concerned, good relations must
                            prevail between Iran and Saudi Arabia. We also realize that if Saudi
                            Arabia had serious misunderstandings with Iran it would be bad. This is
                            of interest to all of us here. <hi rend="italic"><gloss

                            It goes back to the time of Peter the Great. We can take some comfort
                            from the fact that they still have failed to achieve their objective

                            training and we will provide equipment when it is needed—and in doing so
                            we will be as careful with Saudi resources as if they were our own. <hi

                            what the Secretary had said is precisely the Saudi view and that it was

                        <p>A—The President underscored the significance of this visit to Saudi
                            Arabia by the President of the United States, the first <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> President to do so:</p>

                            <p>1. Emphasis on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi friendly,

                                >Faisal</persName>’s own tremendous standing and prestige in
                                area.</p>
                            <p>3. Underscoring the new <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                                direction in its policy towards the Middle East.</p>
                            <p>4. Underscoring the seriousness of our new joint “active partnership”
                                with Saudi Arabia so that this could be heeded by others as a
                                beneficial relation to have with the United States.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> listened to King
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> expound on the
                            wicked designs on the area, and the Arabian peninsula in particular,
                            hatched by the Communists (Chinese, Soviet, etc.) and their Arab
                            helpers. The King stressed the dangers to Saudi Arabia (and therefore to
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests also) coming from the
                            pincer movement around the Peninsula and the Gulf formed by Iraqi
                            designs in the North and <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> in the
                            South.</p>
                        <p>The King warned of these designs which seem to have alliance with Zionist
                            plans against the area.</p>
                        <p>B—In response, the President agreed with King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s analysis of the Communist
                            aims and assured him that the United States was ever watchful because it
                            agreed that this leopard was not going to change its spots readily. The
                            President further explained the strategies of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> policy towards the P.R.C. and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. In essence, this policy was purely
                            pragmatic based on interests, indeed on the interest of the world in not
                            having confrontation between giant powers (China: mini-nuclear, yes, but
                            with ¼ of the world’s population, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>). China did not love the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>, rather it feared the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb facs="0446" n="411" xml:id="pg_411"/>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> relations were based on accommodation in certain
                            fields of mutual interest so that the Soviets cannot readily extricate
                            themselves from such relationship with us and proceed to do harm to
                            others. We would not stand, anyway, for the Soviets or any others taking
                            advantage of détente at the expense of our friends such as Saudi
                            Arabia.</p>
                        <p>C—The United States emphasis on supporting the moderate, responsible
                            governments and elements in the area was also manifest by our “journey
                            for peace.” The point was obvious in Egypt, now in Saudi Arabia, then
                            Syria. We hope all other Arab countries will follow suit.</p>
                        <p>D—The President asked the King to use influence with Syria so it (and the
                            other Arabs) would not rush things at the Geneva Conference by putting
                            all issues and topics on the same tray for instant solution. This is not
                            only not possible, but it is not wise. Give this your understanding and
                            patience with our tactics and timing.</p>
                        <p>E—The President intimated to the King that Iraq had sent us a message
                            saying it was not, as supposed, totally in the pocket of the Soviets.
                            What did the King think our reply should be? Should we respond formally
                            to such an Iraqi approach?</p>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> was in favor of
                            doing anything which would, hopefully, wean Iraq and any other country
                            away from the accursed Communists. Yes, give Iraq if only one eye with
                            which to see the light. “One eye is better than blindness.”</p>
                        <p>F—Arms: King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> explained
                            the need of certain Arab and Muslim states for arms.</p>
                        <p>President explained Congressional limitations on arms to Pakistan. There
                            are also limits as to what we can supply Egypt and how much. However, if
                            Saudi Arabia found it useful and feasible it could help its friends with
                            any extra amounts it orders. This did not mean to imply that Saudi
                            Arabia should pay for all this, however. In any case this whole subject
                            should be held in strictest confidence.</p>
                        <p>The United States was keenly interested in Saudi Arabia playing the role
                            of “watch man” vis-à-vis the small states of the Gulf: to help
                            strengthen them, to support them and to have consultations between Saudi
                            Arabia and the United States on that area and its stability.</p>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> informed the
                            President that “only two days ago I received two messages: one from King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HBAT_1">Hassan</persName> II of Morocco, the
                            other from President Bhuto of Pakistan asking me to intercede with the
                            President for arms needed by them.”</p>
                        <p>The President thought Morocco was an easier case. Pakistan was subject to
                            the Congressional ban, but something could be worked out given Saudi
                            Arabia and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> cooperation.</p>
                        <p>G—The President informed King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> that we would be announcing (Sunday 6/16/74) the
                            restoration of diplomatic relations with Syria.</p>
                        <pb facs="0447" n="412" xml:id="pg_412"/>
                        <p>The King was delighted, praised Asad.</p>
                        <p>H—King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> repeatedly
                            expressed the wish that our American friends could stand solidly by
                            their President and the new policy for a just peace in the Middle East
                            worked on so tirelessly by brilliant Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>. It is painful to see all these intrigues
                            against the President and his Secretary of State just at this juncture.
                            It cannot be coincidental.</p>
                        <p>The King promised to continue his talk with (and hopefully influence
                            over) his Arab brethren to see the wisdom of going along with the United
                            States on the new path of friendship and cooperation, given the
                            continuation of the United States’s new direction and its efforts for a
                            just and lasting peace.</p>
                        <p>I—The King asked that, if possible, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> not hold official meetings in
                            Jerusalem but in Tel Aviv, lest agitators spread wrong rumors about
                                “<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> recognizing Jerusalem as
                            Israel’s capital.”</p>
                        <p>The President said, frankly, talks were scheduled in Jerusalem but he had
                            repeatedly refused to go to the old (Arab) city.</p>
                        <p>J—The President, as a final point, asked King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> for the favor of influencing
                            the oil producing countries to reduce the price of oil so it can be
                            manageable and would fit in with development of new sources of
                            energy.</p>
                        <p>The King said, of course, any result “would depend on whether the other
                            oil producing countries would heed our counsel,” but he promised to
                            continue trying.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>Now that I have returned to Washington and have had time to reflect on my
                            visit to the Middle East, I want to share with you my thoughts about the
                            significance for our two countries of the journey I have just
                            completed.</p>
                        <pb facs="0448" n="413" xml:id="pg_413"/>
                        <p>By visiting the Middle East at this time, I wanted to demonstrate the
                            strength of the United States commitment to work for a just and lasting
                            peace consistent with the dignity and legitimate interests of all the
                            states and peoples of the Middle East. I also wanted to underline the
                            friendship of the American people for the peoples of the Arab world and
                            to give impetus to the various steps now underway to strengthen and to
                            give more concrete expression to the historic as well as the newly
                            evolving links between the United States and the Arab countries.
                            Progress toward peace, and progress in American-Arab relations, will
                            reinforce each other, and I believe we have together made significant
                            progress toward these objectives.</p>
                        <p>I also feel that, as a result of our talks, each of us has a better
                            understanding of the other’s concerns, hopes and political realities. I
                            particularly welcomed the opportunity to describe to you in detail our
                            concept of approaching a final settlement step-by-step, so that each
                            succeeding step will build on the confidence and experience gained in
                            the preceding one. In this process, we consider it important that there
                            be flexibility about procedures while keeping clearly in mind that the
                            final goal is an overall settlement among all of the parties and on all
                            the fundamental issues.</p>
                        <p>Your Majesty, the friendship with which I was received and the positive
                            response I found everywhere give me hope that, with determination,
                            patience and vision this lofty goal can and will be achieved.</p>
                        <p>I welcomed the opportunity my visit afforded for the two of us to affirm
                            our personal support for the steps our governments are taking to give
                            new form and structure to our traditionally close relationship. I intend
                            to give close personal attention to the work of the joint commissions
                            and working groups which our governments have agreed to establish. I am
                            sure that our comprehensive and friendly discussions in Jidda have
                            confirmed the old saying that “Old friendships, like old gold, increase
                            in value with time.” This is why I take particular pleasure in
                            reiterating to Your Majesty what great honor it would give us, your
                            “American friends”—as you have so aptly called us—to receive you in our
                            country, both formally and personally, when your circumstances permit
                            such a welcome visit.</p>
                        <p>Your Majesty, I am convinced that we have witnessed in recent months a
                            turning point in the history of the Middle East—a turning toward an
                            honorable, just and durable peace—and have ushered in a new era in
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Arab relations. The period
                            ahead will be difficult at times, and the way will not always be as
                            smooth or the pace as rapid as you and I would wish. But a direction has
                            been set, and it is my firm intention to stay on the course we have
                            charted.</p>
                        <p>Finally, allow me to reiterate my deepest appreciation to Your Majesty
                            for the warm hospitality accorded Mrs. Nixon and me throughout our visit
                            to Saudi Arabia.</p>

                        <p>Your Majesty:</p>
                        <p>Now that I have had an opportunity to reflect on my trips to the Middle
                            East and the Soviet Union, I feel it is time to follow up my very
                            helpful discussions with you in Jidda and your letter of June 30 by
                            further sharing with you some of our thoughts about the months
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>First of all, as I told Your Majesty, we are fully committed to
                            maintaining the steady pace of the peace negotiations that have produced
                            the agreements of the past six months. They are only first steps, but
                            they have been important in establishing a process of negotiation for
                            the first time in a quarter of a century in the Middle East. Without
                            this process, it is difficult to see how concrete steps could be taken
                            toward peace. That is why it has been necessary to expend so much time
                            and effort in establishing and consolidating the negotiating practices
                            which have now begun to show results.</p>
                        <p>Now that this foundation has been laid, we are deeply conscious of the
                            need to move forward in a way that will strengthen the process. In the
                            next several weeks, we shall hold detailed consultations in Washington
                            with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Allon</persName>,
                            Prime Minister Rifai, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FI_1"
                                >Fahmy</persName> and a representative of President Asad. The
                            purpose of these discussions will be to reach understandings on how we
                            should now proceed.</p>
                        <pb facs="0450" n="415" xml:id="pg_415"/>
                        <p>As Your Majesty knows, it is planned that the Middle East Peace
                            Conference will resume its work in Geneva this fall. We are keenly aware
                            how important it is for reaching agreement on a durable peace that the
                            issues of withdrawal, final borders, security, the interests of the
                            Palestinians, the status of Jerusalem and the long-term relationships
                            among states in the area be addressed constructively and decisively at
                            successive stages of the negotiations, as the time for each becomes ripe
                            and the necessary groundwork is laid. Our efforts now are being directed
                            at working out with the members of the Conference how best to structure
                            the negotiations so that they may lead toward a final settlement.</p>
                        <p>Your Majesty is well aware of our judgment that great care must be
                            exercised in assuring that each step is taken when adequate support has
                            been developed for the decisions that are required. This judgment has
                            led us to the view that it is important to move steadily a step at a
                            time, attempting at each point in the negotiation to achieve what is
                            realistic. I am sure Your Majesty will recognize the wisdom of building
                            on a solid foundation.</p>
                        <p>I am aware of Your Majesty’s concerns about the situation in Egypt, on
                            which I will be communicating with you separately, as well as about the
                            recent violence on the border between Israel and Lebanon and about
                            developments in the occupied territories. We have been exercising our
                            influence to calm the situation and bring an end to the violence, and we
                            will continue to do so. With respect to the occupied territories, we
                            have repeatedly made clear—and this remains our policy—that we do not
                            accept any unilateral action by any of the parties in the area as
                            predetermining the outcome of a final settlement. I know Your Majesty
                            will understand why it is important, in the interest of our continuing
                            to play an effective peacemaking role, that our efforts in these areas
                            of concern to you be carried out with discretion in quiet diplomatic
                            ways.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Your Majesty, as our consultations with the parties to the
                            Geneva Conference proceed, we will want to discuss further with your
                            Government the next steps in the negotiations. Meanwhile, I wanted to
                            keep Your Majesty advised of the fact that, now that I have returned
                            from Moscow, we are moving promptly to assure that steady progress in
                            the negotiations is maintained.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: There are recent indications that a conscious decision has been
                            taken by the Saudi leadership to delay the full implementation of
                            specific development and other agreements concluded with the United
                            States Government. Factors contributing to this policy involve serious
                            doubts on the part of senior Saudi officials about the real intentions
                            of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> concerning peace in the
                            Middle East. Furthermore, there are strong indications that the Saudi
                            leadership will not consider questions of oil production increases or
                            oil price reductions until renewed assurances are received that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> intends to continue its efforts
                            toward achieving a Middle East peace settlement. END OF SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>1. From conversations with several senior and middle-level Saudi
                            officials, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                            have recently detected a lack of enthusiasm on the part of Saudi
                            officials for actual implementation of the “new relationship” between
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and Saudi Arabia. While the
                            established working groups continue to perform, they are only producing
                            recommendations which are subject to further review. In Riyadh, these
                            views, [<hi rend="italic">6½ lines not declassified</hi>]. Thus, the
                            views [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] set
                            forth below, may well reflect accurately those of more senior Saudi
                            policy makers.</p>
                        <p>2. Working level Saudi economic planners and economists feel that a
                            conscious decision has been taken by the Saudi leadership to go slow in
                            the implementation of specific development and other projects with the
                            United States Government. A number of factors seem to have contributed
                            to this decision. First, they believe that there is considerable doubt
                            about the real intentions of President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName> toward the Arab World in general and Saudi Arabia
                            specifically. President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>’s
                            past <pb facs="0452" n="417" xml:id="pg_417"/> statements and positions
                            on the Arab-Israeli issue have been examined closely by the Saudi
                            leadership and have done nothing to allay this concern. Although they
                            are in no sense hostile to President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName>, the Saudis have been anxiously waiting for some
                            sign or gesture by the new administration that it sincerely intends to
                            proceed with equal vigor with the policies of the former administration.
                            Since there has been no sign and no tangible progress recently toward a
                            peace settlement, the Saudi Government has consciously adopted a “wait
                            and see” policy. No additional progress in Saudi-<gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> relations can be expected until there is some renewed
                            movement toward an area settlement. (It should be noted that these
                            statements were made to us prior to the announcement of your planned
                            visit to the Middle East 8–13 October 1974.)</p>
                        <p>3. A second factor causing concern in Saudi leadership circles as of
                            early to mid-September was the sudden increase in rumors, some of which
                            originated from official Egyptian sources, that you will resign before
                            the end of the year. Saudi officials believe that if this is true, it
                            would be a clear sign that the American Government had taken a definite
                            step back from its new policy of evenhandedness in the Arab-Israeli
                            dispute.</p>
                        <p>4. Working level Saudi officials concerned with petroleum matters believe
                            that Saudi oil production increases and the question of significant
                            price reductions will not receive serious positive consideration from
                            the Saudi leadership until they have received renewed assurances that
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government intends to continue
                            its efforts for a peace settlement. Although storage capacity problems
                            and adverse weather conditions may have been partially responsible for
                            any recent decrease in Saudi oil production, it is totally unrealistic
                            to think that this would have been undertaken without explicit agreement
                            of the highest levels of the Saudi Government. Without progress towards
                            an area settlement, the Saudi leadership feels itself under no
                            obligation to look for alternate solutions to such technical problems
                            and is likely to continue to go along with the majority of other
                            Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (<gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                                >OPEC</gloss>) in matters of pricing and production.</p>
                        <p>5. On the purely internal development side, Saudi economic planners have
                            increasingly heard the argument put forth by senior officials such as
                                <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nazir</persName> and Aba al-Khayl that a
                            rational Saudi development plan can be implemented solely on the income
                            of current Saudi reserves and a greatly decreased level of oil
                            production. Current Saudi free reserves (i.e., reserves over and above
                            current expenditures and obligations) are estimated at US $15 billion.
                            Saudi internal development schemes could be financed on the returns from
                            no-risk investment of these funds alone.</p>
                        <pb facs="0453" n="418" xml:id="pg_418"/>
                        <p>6. Senior Saudi officials in Jidda, [<hi rend="italic">names not
                                declassified</hi>] agree that the honeymoon euphoria has cooled
                            noticeably since April. This seems to be the result of the following
                            factors:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>a. There has been a natural letdown following the emotional high
                                resulting from Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>’s trip to Washington and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s visit to Saudi Arabia in
                                June. This normal psychological reaction was accentuated
                                dramatically when President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                    >Nixon</persName> resigned and was replaced by a personality
                                unknown to the Saudis and whom they believe may harbor a pro-Israeli
                                bias.</p>
                            <p>b. The visit of Treasury Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SW_1"
                                    >Simon</persName> in July and the follow-up activity associated
                                with it has been accompanied by extensive publicity in Washington,
                                much of which was not coordinated in advance with Saudi officials in
                                Jidda, which has left the Saudis with the feeling that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has been hustling them too
                                much.</p>
                            <p>c. The Saudis are also beginning to have growing doubts about whether
                                the political quid pro quo they bargained for is really going to be
                                paid off. They remember that former President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> promised to devote the full
                                energies of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to bring about
                                a “just and lasting peace” in the Middle East based on the “full
                                implementation” of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242
                                and 338. Although the intelligent Saudi leadership is thoroughly
                                mindful and appreciative of the obstacles and distractions which are
                                delaying the peace effort (and readily concede that many of these
                                obstacles are the result of Arab intransigence on specific issues),
                                they are nonetheless disturbed at the prospect that Saudi efforts to
                                lend economic support to the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                                (i.e., massive purchases of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                                securities and efforts to control rising oil prices) may give the
                                impression to their critics that they have gone too far in
                                supporting the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in exchange for
                                an equitable political settlement.</p>

                                >Akins</persName> when he called on Bob <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                                >Ellsworth</persName> the following day (below).</p>
                        <p>(C) During their visit to Washington in June 1974, Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> and his party requested that
                            action be taken to expedite 40 <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            cases for Saudi Arabia. In summary, their status is as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) 8 have been completed; a few were completed as far back as one and
                            two years. (Includes 1,000 sub-machine guns shipped 12 September.)</p>
                        <p>(2) Army has taken action to expedite 16 others; shipments will be made
                            on these cases in 30 to 90 days. (Includes 200 3.5 inch rocket
                            launchers, 100 81mm mortars, some ammunition, 25 tank trucks and
                            miscellaneous items).</p>
                        <p>(3) There are 9 cases open for repair parts. An 03 priority has been
                            assigned to Saudi Arabia since <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>’s visit. (The Department of the Army states this
                            priority is equal to or better than about 30% of all US Army units in
                            Europe.) Deliveries range for the most part from the 1st quarter of
                                <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 75 to the 3rd quarter of <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 75.</p>
                        <p>(4) One case for 200 M825 ¼ ton trucks is ready for shipment but is
                            awaiting Saudi payment. Army states that the Saudis have been advised
                            repeatedly that funds are required.</p>
                        <p>(5) One case for various kinds of ammunition was issued in April 1973 but
                            not accepted until March 1975; advance payments were not received until
                            June. As a result the data was no longer valid and a revised offer to
                            reflect latest cost and availability was dispatched on 28 September; the
                            cost will increase from $3.3 million to $5.1 million. This case probably
                            will continue to be troublesome.</p>
                        <p>(6) One case for battery chargers was signed in September 1973 but Saudi
                            funds were not deposited until 28 June, nine months later. Thus,
                            procurement action was delayed and delivery is now scheduled for the
                            first quarter of <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 76.</p>
                        <p>(7) Four cases have principal items scheduled for delivery after 31
                            December 1974. Diversions from US stocks or other <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> programs <pb facs="0456" n="421"
                                xml:id="pg_421"/> would be required in order to expedite deliveries
                            (recommended diversions being forwarded to Sec Def 7–8 October).</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> was glad to receive a

                            On 5 September Embassy Jidda cabled a list of equipment which <gloss

                            certain exceptions, we have approved sale of these items. The Services
                            have provided price and availability data which is being pouched to
                            Embassies Jidda and Sanaa. We are reviewing the P&amp;A data (almost all
                            of the lead times are relatively long) for possible diversions. Prince
                            Sultan said that he appreciated the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss>’s rapid and forthcoming response to this Saudi request,
                            that he wanted letters of offer as soon as possible and, in the
                            meantime, would stall off French offers to sell arms. The letters of
                            offer are in preparation.</p>

                            was not great (one C–5 can carry 8 F–5’s), and we have a small excess
                            capacity at present. The only alternative would be to try to have Saudis
                            and Iranians pressure GOG into changing its mind—both we and State felt
                            that this was not likely to be successful and we also considered it
                            would be useful to demonstrate our ability to do without a Greek

                            offered to send a small <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> survey team

                                Arabia.</p>
                            <p>Summary: The Saudi Government is discouraged with the apparent
                                slowness of the US to respond to Saudi defense needs, and we urge
                                the establishment immediately of a mechanism within <gloss
                                    target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> to expedite matters relating to
                                Saudi Arabia, as well as quick action on providing arms to the Yemen
                                Arab Republic. Should we fail to become more responsive, we risk
                                losing our preeminent position here to France, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> and others anxious to serve Saudi
                                Arabia.</p>
                            <p>1. During recent months it has become apparent that the leadership of
                                Saudi Arabia is becoming discouraged with what it sees as a lack of
                                responsiveness, enthusiasm and efficiency on the part of the United
                                States in meeting Saudi Arabia’s defense needs. It is also evident
                                that the Saudi leadership respects and trusts the United States,
                                prefers US equipment and training over that of the United Kingdom
                                and France, but has had to turn to those nations—which are eager to
                                be accommodating—because the United States has been unable or
                                unwilling to produce.</p>
                            <p>2. Last June while meeting with <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>
                                officials in the United States, Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                    >Fahd</persName>, the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of
                                Interior and probably de facto successor to King <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>, raised this point as a
                                matter of <pb facs="0459" n="424" xml:id="pg_424"/> serious concern
                                to Saudi Arabia. More recently, in the context of Saudi military aid
                                to the Yemen Arab Republic, Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                    >Fahd</persName> advised <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>
                                President in early July that the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                    >YAR</gloss> should seek armor equipment from the French and
                                other military supplies and services from the British because of
                                “slow American action in delivering military equipment.” Prince
                                Sultan, the Minister of Defense and firm advocate of US military
                                cooperation, commented early this month that he did not expect the
                                US would be either willing or able to respond to recent <gloss
                                    target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> requests for military assistance
                                with the same enthusiasm as the French are displaying.</p>
                            <p>3. The need for close US-Saudi relations is well known, as is the
                                desirability both politically and economically of an active role for
                                the United States in the development of Saudi Arabia. Because of the
                                many years of amicable, mutually profitable dealings by Americans
                                here, we have a head start on the many other nations, which are, in
                                Prince Sultan’s words, “moving very fast” to improve their
                                positions.</p>
                            <p>4. It is recognized that Saudi Arabia, with its decision-making
                                processes centered on only a very few individuals, can act much more
                                quickly than the United States, and I recognize that not all Saudi
                                Arabia’s expectations may be reasonable. But the key point here is
                                that the British and French are apparently capable of being
                                responsive in Saudi terms. For example, in May 74, when the Ministry
                                of Defense and aviation asked for information on availability and
                                cost on short range air defense weapons by 11 June, both the French
                                and British met the deadline. The United States offer did not come
                                through until 7 July. By that time the Saudis were already involved
                                in visits to Europe to view French and British equipment and tests.
                                It now appears the Saudi army will buy the French Crotale missile,
                                although the US Vulcan gun system may also still be considered. The
                                    <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> survey of the needs of
                                Saudi armed forces is another example of seemingly unnecessary
                                delays that have disappointed and discouraged the Saudis. The survey
                                was begun in April and completed in June. It was originally promised
                                to the Saudi government by mid-June, a date continually extended
                                until it was finally released on 20 September 1974, leaving the
                                Saudis only perhaps 30 days to study it before the Joint Security
                                Commission meets in late October. If another example is needed, the
                                question of new uniforms for the Saudi Army is a case in point. The
                                latest information available here indicates it will require 18
                                months to two years to provide them. <gloss target="#t_MODA_1"
                                    >MODA</gloss> had asked for them by late fall of this year, and
                                despite the long delay apparently still wants to buy them from the
                                United States, because of the prestige of the soldiers having
                                uniforms “direct from the United States.” How long the Saudis will
                                hold to such values in the face of our relative lack of
                                responsiveness is subject to severe question.</p>
                            <pb facs="0460" n="425" xml:id="pg_425"/>
                            <p>5. I strongly urge that a mechanism be established within <gloss
                                    target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> to monitor and expedite matters
                                pertaining to US security assistance to Saudi Arabia. We recommend
                                the establishment of such a body as a key agenda item for Under
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> during
                                the conduct of his meetings in connection with the Joint Security
                                Commission. I would suggest, however, that this action be instituted
                                before he arrives, so that he can discuss it as a project already
                                well under way. I believe this will show the Saudi Government that
                                the United States is interested and working hard to be more
                                responsive.</p>
                            <p>6. I also ask that action on the supplying of arms to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> be expedited and that a solid
                                response, including the date of arrival of the US Mission, be
                                forwarded as soon as possible, but well before the Joint Security
                                Commission meets.</p>
                            <p>7. I wish to emphasize again that Saudi Arabia is a close ally of the
                                United States but its leaders are increasingly aware of their power
                                and their options to deal with any country they choose. They pay
                                cash. If we are to maintain our position and gain the resultant
                                benefits we must be more forthcoming and responsive. Otherwise, we
                                risk losing the race and the prize to the French, the British and
                                the others.</p>

                        <p>The following is Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s report of his conversations with King
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>“I had a one and one half hour audience with King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> in Riyadh this evening,
                            preceded by a one hour preliminary meeting with Foreign Minister Saqqaf.
                            Contrary to some indications we had that the King might be in a
                            difficult mood, and despite his fatigue in the last few <pb facs="0461"
                                n="426" xml:id="pg_426"/> days of the fasting month of Ramadan, I
                            found His Majesty alert and the atmosphere of the meeting warm and
                            positive. I conveyed to the King your personal greetings and hope that
                            he will be able to visit you, as well as your strong commitment to
                            continuity in our Middle East policy.</p>
                        <p>“The King reiterated several times his strong desire for even closer
                            relations with the United States and his determination to do all he can
                            to encourage closer United States ties with the Arab world. As he has on
                            a number of occasions recently, the King combined this with an appeal
                            for rapid movement on the peacemaking front. He also urged that we do
                            all we can to speed our assistance to the Arab countries, that Saudi
                            Arabia is encouraging to follow a peaceful and moderate course. I
                            assured him of our firm intention to do so.</p>
                        <p>“The King made his usual plea for the all-out Arab program: 1967
                            frontiers, return of Palestinians, Jerusalem. The King listened
                            carefully to my explanation of our current strategy and of the need to
                            mobilize support for it at home. I stressed the imperative need for a
                            step-by-step approach. While he would obviously like more rapid
                            progress, I believe I was able to obtain greater understanding on his
                            part of the realities within which we must work and to allay for now, at
                            least, the restiveness which he has lately reflected. I also explained
                            why we feel we must vote against the General Assembly Resolution on the
                            Palestine Liberation Organization. Despite <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s strong emotional support
                            for the Palestine cause, he acknowledged that we must do what we feel
                            necessary to preserve our peacemaking role. I am hopeful that he will
                            help temper Arab reactions to our position on this issue in New
                            York.</p>
                        <p>“I am particularly encouraged by my talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> on the oil price question. In
                            explaining our concerns about the effect of high prices on the world
                            economic structure, I made clear that our recent public statements on
                            his questions were not directed only at the Arabs. I stressed that a
                            collapse of the world economy would only assist the spread of Communism.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> affirmed that it is
                            Saudi policy to bring prices down and said he would seek to help in this
                            respect, with other oil producers. He urged me to say so publicly. In my
                            departure remarks at the airport, I commented favorably on Saudi
                            Arabia’s constructive position on the oil price question—a statement
                            which the Saudis made clear they welcomed. Saqqaf, the Foreign Minister,
                            endorsed the statement. He also effusively supported our step-by-step
                            approach which should help greatly in Syria and other radical
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>“Given King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s influence
                            in the Arab world, particularly with those countries whose support for
                            our peacemaking efforts is important, and recent indications that
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> was becoming
                            disheartened and beginning to doubt our constancy, I am very encouraged
                            by his positive reaction this evening. I think we can count on him to
                            help keep tempers <pb facs="0462" n="427" xml:id="pg_427"/> calm in the
                            area as we continue our preparations for the next stage of the

                        <p>“I am now on my way back to Cairo where I will have talks tomorrow with

                        <p>The Secretary has asked me to provide you with the following report of
                            his meeting with King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                            >Faisal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>“I flew from Cairo to Riyadh, the desert capital of Saudi Arabia, for an
                            hour and a half audience this evening with King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> before going on to Amman
                            tonight. With his wealth and prestige, the King carries great weight in
                            those Arab countries which are important to our peace efforts, and I
                            again sought his support in urging moderation on the Syrians and <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> during the period ahead.</p>
                        <p>“I explained generally to the King, and in greater detail to his Foreign
                            Minister, the problems the Rabat Summit decisions will cause us with the
                            Israelis and at home. While I do not expect to change <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s strong commitment to the
                            Palestinian cause, I am hopeful that through his Foreign Minister, whom
                            he is sending to New York, the Saudis will seek to exercise a moderating
                            influence during the Palestinian debate in the General Assembly next
                            week.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> continues to take an
                            oversimplified view of the Israeli side. The important thing, however,
                            is that he reaffirmed his support for our peace efforts and authorized
                            his Foreign Minister to make a statement at the airport strongly
                            supporting our step-by-step approach. He also authorized Foreign
                            Minister Saqqaf to reiterate Saudi Arabia’s policy of working to
                            stabilize and ultimately bring down oil prices.</p>
                        <p>“In addition, the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> gave me an opportunity to relieve Saudi
                            suspicions that had been aroused by recent Israeli-<pb facs="0463"
                                n="428" xml:id="pg_428"/>inspired press stories about our military
                            supply to Israel, and to counter suspicions shown at the Rabat Summit
                            about our policy toward a Middle East peace settlement.</p>
                        <p>“We continue to face a difficult road ahead, and I do not want to
                            over-estimate the Saudi will or capacity to stand up alone to pressures
                            from extremist elements in the Arab world. There is no doubt, however,
                            that <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> wants to continue
                            to work with us, both bilaterally and in the Arab world and can be
                            helpful in cooperation with other moderates, particularly <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>. That the two continue to work
                            closely together was evident from the fact that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> sent his special emissary, Ashraf
                            Marwan, from Cairo to Riyadh after my meetings in Cairo this morning to
                            brief the King before my audience with him. To sum up: we defused the
                            situation and created an opening for negotiations. A lot now depends on
                            the Israelis.</p>
                        <p>“I will meet with King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>
                            tomorrow morning before going on to Damascus and Tel Aviv, after which
                            we should have a clearer picture of where the Rabat Summit leaves us. At
                            a minimum, however, I am hopeful that my current trip has defused the
                            post-Rabat situation in the area and may possibly have opened up the
                            opportunity for further negotiations.”</p>

                        <p>MEMO OF RECORD: Discussion Between Prince <persName corresp="#p_TBAS_1"
                                >Turki</persName> of Saudi Arabia and Secretary of Defense <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName> and Deputy Secretary of
                            Defense <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName></p>
                        <p>1. The Prince asked that the Secretary convey to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> greetings and best wishes from
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>, together with
                            hope for success and prosperity in his Administration. The Prince
                            indicated that he wanted to assure the Secretary of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s desire to strengthen
                            friendship and cooperation between the two countries. He emphasized the
                            importance of paying no attention to efforts from various sources <pb
                                facs="0464" n="429" xml:id="pg_429"/> to disrupt relations between
                            the two countries. He believes that now is the time to strengthen
                            relationships in pursuit of the common objective of peace and prosperity
                            in the Middle East. The Prince indicated that while he was well aware of
                            the difficulties the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> must face in
                            dealing with the problems of the Middle East, it was his hope that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Mission at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> would adopt a flexible position with
                            regard to the Palestinian issue.</p>
                        <p>2. The Secretary expressed appreciation for the Prince’s views and for
                            his greetings which he would convey to the President.</p>
                        <p>3. The Prince indicated that statements of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> concerning the Middle East have
                            been well received and appreciated by Arab Governments. He emphasized
                            again that a flexible position of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> on the Palestinian issue is important and that it would
                            make the task easier for King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> to bring about the kind of settlement desired by
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and which Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> has been attempting to work
                            out.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary indicated that he would convey these specific points to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and the
                            President, and particularly the point on flexibility of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Mission at the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> said that
                            the position of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> calls for some
                            movement on the Palestinian issue. He personally felt strongly on this
                            point and believed that the Secretary of Defense shared his views.
                            However, how far we could go in terms of achieving our objective would
                            depend on flexibility of both sides.</p>
                        <p>6. The Prince indicated that the initiative should be up to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> He did not wish to place a greater
                            burden on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> shoulders but the Saudi
                            Government is prepared to provide whatever assistance it could. The
                            sooner that flexibility occurs, the sooner there will be peace in the
                            area. The present leaders in all of the Arab States are men eager to
                            move together in finding a settlement based on peace and justice. All of
                            these leaders want to improve relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> and it is important that they receive encouragement at
                            this time. The Prince said he was aware of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Government difficulties but believed that it would be
                            possible to achieve a common objective. Once again there is a word of
                            warning—do not pay attention to those who seek to destroy good relations
                            between our two countries. This relationship of friendship is reflected
                            in statements recently issued by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> and also in correspondence from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>. The Prince also
                            expressed best wishes for a speedy recovery by former President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>.</p>
                        <p>7. The Secretary remarked on the eloquent comments of the Prince
                            concerning the Palestinian question. He said that we are keenly aware of
                            the friendship that King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> has shown and that the Saudi people have
                            expressed toward the United States since the 1930’s. He said that the
                            views of the leaders of Arab nations are well understood and that <pb
                                facs="0465" n="430" xml:id="pg_430"/> the Prince’s comments would be
                            conveyed to President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and
                            to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>8. The Prince noted that friendship between the two countries dates back
                            at least to the time of President Roosevelt. He said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> knows what its security interests are
                            and that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should give further
                            military support.</p>
                        <p>9. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> said that
                            both he and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>
                            had discussed the matter of support many times. He also discussed this
                            with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. The
                            relationships which both governments have is something which must be
                            safeguarded and protected. This relationship has special problems such
                            as the Palestinian issue and it is in the best interests of both
                            governments to get the problem solved.</p>
                        <p>10. The Prince agreed that the special relationship between the two
                            countries must be protected. The Prince went on to point out that it was
                            important to strengthen military capabilities and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> has come to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> because of friendship to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, because <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> equipment is superior, and because it is felt that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would respond to the Saudi
                            needs. In closing, the Prince quoted remarks of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> upon the Prince’s departure
                            for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, “Please emphasize to our
                            friends in the United States, our urgent need for them to meet our
                            military requests which we regard as important.”</p>
                        <p>11. The Secretary indicated that we are anxious to move ahead as soon as
                            possible in strengthening Saudi military capabilities and that this
                            continues to be a matter addressed by the Joint Commission. However, the
                            capacity of the available trained manpower to absorb additional training
                            and equipment becomes the pacing factor. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> indicated that this is the
                            number 1 issue and the Prince concurred, saying this is a point which
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> makes with all
                            visitors.</p>
                        <p>12. The Prince raised one final point on behalf of Prince Sultan in
                            regard to arms for Egypt. He expressed eagerness that this request be
                            fulfilled as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>13. The Secretary pointed out that legal issues are involved with
                            transfer of equipment to a third party. Such transfer requires a finding
                            by the Secretary of State and subsequent public disclosure. This would
                            raise an issue on which we should ponder. The Prince said that he was
                            aware of such difficulties but wanted to emphasize the urgency because
                            both countries should do all they possibly could to end the dependence
                            of Egypt upon Soviet assistance.</p>
                        <p>14. The Secretary said he would discuss this matter with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> upon his return.
                            Once again, he thanked the Prince for his courtesy in transmitting the
                            King’s greetings. He said that the Prince had spoken most eloquently of
                            the Palestinian tragedy which we must <pb facs="0466" n="431"
                                xml:id="pg_431"/> attempt to correct in terms of historical justice.
                            The Prince said he had no doubts about the Secretary’s feelings on this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>15. [<hi rend="italic">4½ lines not declassified</hi>] Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> said that in regard
                            to the broader issue of training that our desire is to assist as quickly
                            as possible. However, it would be necessary for the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> to make available people for training.
                            He noted that for years Iran has had 10,000 students in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and that only when a country could
                            achieve such a volume of long-term training could the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> hope to accomplish the things which
                            they desired to do in terms of commercial change and improved defenses.
                            The Prince indicated that this is exactly what he desired to do.</p>

                                WITH PRINCE TURKI</p>
                            <p>1. The following additional points were items of discussion between
                                Prince <persName corresp="#p_TBAS_1">Turki</persName>, Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>, and
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>. However,
                                these two points were not included in the basic Memo for Record
                                which was provided to the Saudi delegation.</p>
                            <p>2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> pointed
                                out that the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> has peculiar,
                                special relationships with other countries in the Middle East and it
                                may be necessary to discuss these relationships. The paths of common
                                interest have not been the same in the recent past, such as between
                                Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In the future, the paths may not necessarily
                                be the same. Prince <persName corresp="#p_TBAS_1">Turki</persName>
                                replied that this is true and all the more reason why it will be
                                necessary to protect the special relationship between the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                    >SAG</gloss> and not allow Israel or other Arab states to
                                destroy this relationship.</p>
                            <p>3. During the discussion concerning the security [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >less than 1 <pb facs="0467" n="432" xml:id="pg_432"/> line not

                                    >SAG</gloss>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                                    >Schlesinger</persName> noted that there have been and continue
                                to be forces at work seeking to undermine the security of Arab

                        <p>Corruption, according to one definition of the term or another, has
                            probably always existed in Saudi Arabia. We have been looking closely at
                            the subject since the beginning of the year. Our original examination
                            led to the tentative conclusion that corruption was widespread, involved
                            some high-ranking people, could lead to embarrassment of the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> and to American firms doing business
                            in Saudi Arabia (and perhaps the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>),
                            but that it was not so widespread, high-reaching and resented as to
                            endanger over the short or medium term the stability of the present
                            regime and hurt the very major <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            interests in Saudi Arabia. We have since revised this estimate. Because
                            we have been looking for it we have seen more of corruption and of its
                            effects. At the same time we have concluded that corruption has been on
                            the increase. There is no immediate danger to the regime or <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests but the unchecked growth of
                            corruption at the present rate would probably start to breed political
                            instability fairly soon after King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> (who is honest and admires honesty in others)
                            passes from the scene. The effect on a vital <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> interest—a reliable source of oil and a responsible
                            use of resulting income—would be incalculable. We recommend certain
                            limited actions we might take to inhibit corruption and protect our
                            interests.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>Examination of the subject of corruption in Saudi Arabia requires
                            defining the term in a way that has meaning. There are many actions and
                            patterns of behavior in Saudi Arabia which might be offensive to <pb
                                facs="0468" n="433" xml:id="pg_433"/> the morals (and aesthetic
                            sensibilities) of the average Westerner. We might term some of these
                            actions corrupt, but unless the Saudis themselves find them morally
                            reprehensible, they have little relevance to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> policy and interests.</p>
                        <p>While there is little that is “Ottoman” about the present Saudi
                            government—it is a combination of the traditional tribal and “modern”
                            European as interpreted by Egyptian bureaucrats—the Ottoman experience
                            has clearly influenced attitudes towards corruption. First because
                            bribery became a way of getting things done or just being left alone
                            during the Ottoman period. At the same time, since there was no
                            particular identification with the apparatus of government, there was no
                            sense of damaging one’s own interests by suborning and corrupting a
                            public official. This attitude has survived in a modified form: there is
                            a strong sense of identification with (and support for) the ruling
                            institution personified by the King. But in general this feeling does
                            not carry over to the apparatus of government.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (5 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Equally great influences come from Saudi Arabia’s own customs and
                            traditions. Today amidst the burgeoning signs of fabulous wealth it is
                            hard to recall that until very recently Saudi Arabia was the home of
                            very poor peoples and that only 15 years ago the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> couldn’t balance a budget which
                            aspired to economic development and provision of basic social services.
                            The Hajj, now possibly even a net drain on the Saudi economy, was once
                            its mainstay and the prosperity of much of the country depended on how
                            many pilgrims could be relieved of how much money. While this
                            acquisitiveness of the Hijazi might have been scorned by the tribes of
                            the desert, they had their own traditional ways of acquiring money
                            including collecting “tolls” from caravans and selling “protection” to
                            settled agricultural communities.</p>
                        <p>Much as Americans once held frontier self-reliance to be a positive
                            national characteristic, the average Saudi today extols the virtues of
                            the vanishing beduin society: strong individualism (or aversion to
                            discipline?), fierce loyalty to family and tribe; a strong sense of
                            responsibility for weaker members of the tribe and the conviction that
                            loyalty must be repaid.</p>
                        <p>Within this traditional pattern, it is customary for a person with
                            influence to use it to benefit his followers. The person who gains
                            thereby is expected to reward his benefactor in a manner consistent with
                            the benefit derived.</p>
                        <p>Much of the foregoing is not unique to Saudi Arabia, the Arab, or Islamic
                            world. It is, however, a partial explanation of the ubiquitousness of
                            practices such as bribery and influence, peddling, which Americans
                            regard as corrupt. It also points to an ingrained tolerance for these
                                <pb facs="0469" n="434" xml:id="pg_434"/> practices and we must turn
                            to more recent developments to understand why they have now become a
                            threat to the stability of Saudi Arabia.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Small Stuff</p>
                        <p>Any individual or organization trying to do business in Saudi Arabia is
                            quickly confronted with a situation which generally results in some
                            compromise of principles. Even for embassies there is the need to be
                            nice to and do favors for the petty, officious and vain [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] who personally
                            approves the customs clearance of even the smallest shipment. And also
                            for embassies but particularly for commercial enterprises is the need by
                            one means or another to have the cooperation of important port, airport,
                            and customs officials. Even with the cooperation of a top customs
                            official most firms find it advisable to have an “expediter” to make the
                            rounds disbursing small amounts of money to get the signatures necessary
                            to clear a shipment.</p>
                        <p>Saudi laws and regulations were designed to protect Saudi businesses and
                            workers but they also have the effect of enriching enterprising Saudis.
                            Labor is short in Saudi Arabia, but a person waiting to come to Saudi
                            Arabia to work in most cases must have a visa and this means having a
                            “sponsor” who will accept financial responsibility for the person. The
                            amount paid to a sponsor (who in fact assumes very little risk) can run
                            upward from the SR100 per month a maid might pay to several times this
                            for a technically trained person.</p>
                        <p>Businessmen also require sponsors. In the case of a small firm, the
                            sponsor may actually take some risk in return for his share of the
                            profits. In the case of a large and well established firm, however, it’s
                            all gravy. Sponsors (who function to protect the interest of Saudi
                            citizens) should not be confused with agents. That’s where the real
                            action is.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Role of the Agent</p>
                        <p>Wholly owned foreign firms cannot function in law or in practice without
                            a Saudi agent. For a firm new to Saudi Arabia an agent performs many
                            valuable services: visa assistance, customs assistance, introductions to
                            business contacts, etc. The major value of the agent, however, is
                            supposed to be his ability to influence important people when it comes
                            to the awarding of contracts for the really big business. The range of
                            business is vast and the amounts of money involved in the billions.
                            Opportunities for doing business with the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> exist in arms and defense services, civil aviation,
                            health equipment and services, road, housing and other construction,
                            petrochemicals, steel, etc., etc. For a very healthy fee, the agent is
                            supposed to get in touch with the right people who can help get the
                            contract.</p>
                        <p>A company may never know precisely what in fact its agent has done for
                            it. The apparently authentic story is told of a confidential <pb
                                facs="0470" n="435" xml:id="pg_435"/> clerk handling the bids for a
                            multimillion dollar project who informed his brother several days before
                            final ministerial action that a certain company was going to win the
                            bid. The brother had time to contact that company and say it was in
                            trouble but that he could get the bid for a fee of $100,000—payable only
                            if the contract was won. Feeling vulnerable, the company agreed to pay.
                            It got the contract but would have in any case.</p>
                        <p>This case is probably unusual, but it illustrates the atmosphere in which
                            business with the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> is carried
                            out—companies believe a bribe is necessary whether or not it is. In
                            fact, very high commissions are common and a good part of this is paid
                            out in bribes. Most of the really big contracts seem to be handled by
                            relatively few agents, Adnan Khoshoggi being the most famous or
                            notorious. Khoshoggi (or his Triad company) is, for instance, the agent
                            of Raytheon, Northrop, Lockheed and others.</p>

                        <p>We have long known that British and French firms, particularly those in
                            the arms business, have, with the apparent approval of their
                            governments, paid large commissions amounting to bribes. On excellent
                            authority, we have been told that the commission/bribe element of the
                            $625 million [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]
                            contract amounted to around $100 million.</p>
                        <p>Though we couldn’t document it, we know that American companies are also
                            involved in the practice to get and keep contracts. [<hi rend="italic"

                            paid a middling official in the Coast Guard a middling amount to quiet
                            dissatisfaction with its performance on a contract with the Coast Guard
                            Frontier Forces. This fact became known to the Commander of the Coast
                            Guard and was one of the things which came back to haunt [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] in its losing
                            bid for a contract to modernize the National Guard.</p>
                        <p>Saudi Arabian Airlines recently contracted to buy three [<hi

                            commissions for various purposes being the norm in the aviation
                            industry, there is probably not much unusual in the reported $5 million
                            per plane to get this contract.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] recently won a
                            contract for $117 million to staff and operate a series of military
                            hospitals for the next two years. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                not declassified</hi>] was the high bidder on the contract by a
                            fairly wide margin. After a reexamination of the bids, however, [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] was awarded
                            the contract. The word around Riyadh now is that [<hi rend="italic">less

                            million contract with $89 million, the difference of $25 million
                            presumably having gone into “fees” connected with getting the
                            contract.</p>
                        <pb facs="0471" n="436" xml:id="pg_436"/>
                        <p>Foreign firms are not the only ones who pay, of course. There is
                            tremendous public works activity going on all over the country and
                            especially in the cities. It is commonly assumed that the local firms
                            competing for the many contracts also make payoffs.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Many Forms</p>
                        <p>The bribe to get a contract appears to be the most significant form of
                            corruption, at least in terms of the money involved, but it has many
                            forms. Some variants such as the payoff to expedite customs clearance
                            have already been mentioned. Payoffs to officials to remove artificial
                            roadblocks to construction projects is another. One particularly
                            egregious case reportedly involved the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>]. Playing on the desire of the Japanese,
                            the Koreans and the <gloss target="#t_ROC_1">ROC</gloss> to please Saudi
                            Arabia and assure their oil supplies, so the story goes, [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] was offered a
                            quantity of cement at about $35 per ton—well below the world market
                            price. Not content with taking a handsome profit by selling at the then
                            going local rate of about $54 a ton, he ordered merchants with cement on
                            hand to up their prices to about $70 a ton. Everyone with cement to sell
                            turned a handsome profit.</p>
                        <p>Since we have not precisely defined corruption we might also examine the
                            case of oil sales. Theoretically, all of Saudi Arabia’s oil production
                            not taken by Aramco as equity or buy-back oil is marketed by the state
                            owned company Petromin. Practice is fairly close to theory, but not so
                            close that a number of persons can’t turn a healthy riskless profit.
                            This happens because a certain, relatively minor, proportion of Saudi
                            production is allocated to Princes for their disposal. The oil is not
                            turned over to the Princes, only the right to sell it. Through agents
                            the oil is then sold, usually by single shiploads in spot markets around
                            the world. The profit is the difference between the amount paid to the
                            Treasury (believed to be equivalent to the buy-back price paid by
                            Aramco) and the actual selling price. There have been stories in
                            connection with this type of transaction to the effect that agents have
                            taken exorbitant commissions without the knowledge of some of the
                            unsophisticated Princes to whom a quantity of oil has been
                            allocated.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Where Does All the Money Go?</p>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> is an honest man
                            with quite simple tastes. His sense of what constitutes a corrupt
                            practice to be condemned and rooted out includes most if not all of
                            those we have named. We believe he is particularly repelled by the
                            practice of awarding contracts through bribery. Most others at or near
                            the top in the Saudi hierarchy are on the take. [<hi rend="italic">12

                            their salaries. The elaborate villa built by the former Chief of Staff
                            of the Air Force is somewhat of a Riyadh landmark (though some say he
                            lost his position because of this ostentation which also says something
                            about official sensitivity.)</p>
                        <p>A ministerial or other position of authority is not a requirement for
                            sharing in the spoils of corruption. Agents apparently frequently split
                            fees with other agents, a practice which reduces the likelihood of a
                            sore loser doing anything which might ruin the game for all. Similarly,
                            the Princes with the greatest opportunity reportedly are generous with
                            their less fortunate brothers and cousins. (The oil allocation is one
                            way in which opportunity is shared.) At the same time, royal recipients
                            would be expected to, and presumably do to some extent, share their good
                            fortune with their many non-royal followers, helpers and hangers-on in
                            continuation of traditional beduin practice. The extent to which this
                            latter practice is adhered to is, of course, a factor in the degree of
                            tolerance of corruption.</p>

                            Omar Saqqaf, several times expressed concern to the Ambassador over the
                            extent and possible effect of corruption. (He claimed to be able to
                            afford his own expensive living standard by inherited wealth—he had said
                            his land holdings in Medina were worth over $15 million—and by reason of
                            the rather large amounts of cash that the King periodically thrust upon
                            him. That also is possible).</p>

                            lost heavily on the Riviera this summer. These and other stories of high
                            living by Saudi princes come to us not only <pb facs="0473" n="438"
                                xml:id="pg_438"/> from American and other Western sources but from
                            Saudis within the country who are critical of this princely behavior.
                            The stories—such as the <hi rend="italic">L’Express</hi> magazine
                            one—may be exaggerated, but are not inherently implausible and are
                            widely believed to be true. [<hi rend="italic">name not

                        <p>We have noted that influential Saudis [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not

                            concern over the effects of corruption. In their most recent
                            conversation on this subject [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>] agreed with the Ambassador’s thesis that rampant
                            corruption could lead to a reaction from Wahabi purists and that this in
                            turn could lead to a takeover of the government, the ousting of the
                            royal family and perhaps the installation of a new Qadafi or worse. [<hi

                            result could come about within the next five years.</p>
                        <p>We have found that in general younger, more junior, and less
                            self-confident Saudi civilian officials are reluctant to discuss the
                            specifics of corruption. However, there is no reluctance to admit the
                            existence of corruption and it is not uncommon to hear talk of the need
                            to purify Saudi society by a return to basic moral principles.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not declassified</hi>] recently told an
                            Embassy officer of his discouragement at frequently having weeks of work
                            on a contract come to naught because of a princely decision to award the
                            contract without regard to normal criteria.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not declassified</hi>], is very religious and
                            also has a finely developed sense of honesty. He carried this to such an
                            extreme that he automatically disqualified his older brother—who has for
                            many years specialized in government contracts—from any bid from [<hi
                                rend="italic">2½ lines not declassified</hi>]. These examples
                            illustrate that there are qualified, capable and potentially powerful
                            people with a very low tolerance for corruption at a time when
                            corruption is visibly on the increase.</p>
                        <p>At the present time there are about 3,000 Saudis studying at colleges and
                            universities in the United States. The figure may be higher now than it
                            ever has been, but for many years large numbers of Saudis have been
                            studying there. We have been interested to note that with very few
                            exceptions almost all of these students have returned to Saudi Arabia
                            when they have completed their studies in the United States (though
                            their stay abroad quite frequently stretched out for a remarkable number
                            of years). <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> trained Saudis now
                            constitute the backbone of most Saudi ministries concerned with
                            economics and development. The salaries of these officials—normal by
                            Saudi standards—are generally but a fraction of what an equally or less
                            well educated representative of a western company is paid in Saudi
                            Arabia. Many of these <pb facs="0474" n="439" xml:id="pg_439"/> people
                            will follow the example they see about them and try to get what they can
                            from the system. They will find that the system of graft is
                            non-exclusive and frequently generous. We believe, however, that a
                            number of other persons will resist the temptations to corruption. From
                            the example of other countries it seems reasonable to assume that these
                            persons will be prepared to work to alter or completely change the
                            system which fosters this corruption. It is in any case doubtful to what
                            extent sharing in the spoils will induce loyalty to the prevailing
                            order—especially as the really big payoffs will continue to go to

                        <p>Whether on the take or not, Saudis in a broad spectrum of society are
                            increasingly aware of the world outside and they care very much what
                            that world thinks of Saudi Arabia. Thus while [<hi rend="italic">name
                                not declassified</hi>] gambling and wenching will have genuinely
                            offended many people—[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                            humiliated many more, some of whom might begin to question a system [<hi

                                >Faisal</persName> is an honest man. He is revered by his subjects,
                            who regard his integrity as above question. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines

                        <p>But the Embassy wonders how relevant <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName>’s personal character traits are to the problems
                            the Royal Family will face as the King relinquishes power, or after his
                            death.</p>
                        <p>The King’s interests seem to be narrowing, and the issues about which he
                            shows most evident concern are general foreign policy, the Arab-Israeli
                            question, and the “Zionist-Communist conspiracy”. On other matters, the
                            Minister of Interior, Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd bin Abd
                                al-Aziz</persName>, and his supporters have been assuming more and
                            more authority. A year and a half ago King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> cancelled <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s planned visit to the United
                            States, and Embassy officers recall <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> was afraid even to approve a visa for a Jewish
                            staff aide of Senator Jackson, though he finally did so. This year,
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s visit to the United
                            States resulted in agreement on a comprehensive special relationship
                            between the United States and Saudi Arabia on economic, scientific, and
                            security matters. Visas for several Jewish newsmen who wished to visit
                            Saudi Arabia were promptly obtained on the Ambassador’s request to
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s influence, moreover, has not
                            appeared to diminish after articles appeared in the French and English
                            press criticizing his extravagance while on vacation this summer. Two of
                            his full brothers, in the Ministries of Interior and Defense, have also
                            been given the personal rank of full Minister.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>] In years to come,
                            moreover, the money available to Saudi Arabia will increase
                            fantastically. By the end of 1974, <pb facs="0475" n="440"
                                xml:id="pg_440"/> Saudi Arabia’s monetary reserves may exceed 20
                            billion dollars; by 1980 they could exceed 100 billion dollars. Royal
                            Family corruption in absolute terms seems bound to increase. But should
                            the King’s influence further weaken, or in that period vanish
                            altogether, there would be no figure in the Royal Family with the record
                            of probity or the moral authority to check a rush to the trough.</p>
                        <p>If, with the passage of time, the Sa’uds become widely identified with
                            corruption, they will become more vulnerable politically. The active
                            loyalty of government officers, the armed services, and the populace
                            that the regime would need in a crisis (and which it probably enjoys
                            now) would be degraded into a passive, opportunistic camp following. The
                            shock effect than of a challenge to the regime could be out of
                            proportion to the physical assets at the opposition’s disposal. The
                            Embassy considers, moreover, that if corruption is allowed to flourish
                            in the next three to five years, the likelihood is good that the regime
                            will have to cope with some troublesome and potentially dangerous
                            challenge to its authority. Reaction time by the government will be
                            critical.</p>
                        <p>At such a juncture, it might well be that the considerable resources of
                            strength of the <persName corresp="#p_SIFI_1">Sa’ud</persName> dynasty
                            would prevail: the family is extraordinarily large and cohesive, and its
                            three to five thousand princes function fairly well as a political
                            party, and as an intelligence gathering mechanism; the monarchy’s
                            legitimacy is widely accepted throughout one of the most homogeneous
                            states in the Middle East; Saudi character tends naturally to be
                            passive, and—always barring complications that may arise out of the
                            Arab-Israeli problem—Saudi Arabia’s relations with its neighbors are
                            less troubled than ever before. Finally—and most importantly—among the
                            mass of royal Princes there are several who could swiftly provide
                            leadership if the regime and the position of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_SIFI_1">Sa’ud</persName> family were challenged. But we
                            would unquestionably have left behind the very rare kind of stability we
                            have become accustomed to in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">ACTIONS TAKEN AND PROPOSED</p>
                        <p>As we have watched corruption mount we have asked ourselves what we might
                            do to counter it—not from any moralistic concern, but as a means of
                            guarding <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests. We have
                            concluded that there is relatively little which we can effectively do,
                            but what we can is worth the effort. As noted, the Ambassador has
                            discussed corruption and his concern over its pernicious effect with
                                [<hi rend="italic">names not declassified</hi>]. He has also
                            discussed the subject with [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines not
                                declassified</hi>]—who like the King is scrupulously honest—left no
                            doubt about his own concern with fighting corruption.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador and other members of the Embassy have also warned American
                            firms doing or considering business in Saudi Arabia <pb facs="0476"
                                n="441" xml:id="pg_441"/> of the pitfalls presented by tying up with
                            “agents” promising lucrative contracts in return for fat “commissions”
                            and other questionable practices. We have pointed out that this could
                            permanently tarnish the reputation of the company in Saudi Arabia and
                            also damage the presently excellent reputation of American business for
                            being straightforward in business dealings.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] has urged the Ambassador
                            to take up the question of corruption with the King since the King knows
                            and respects the Ambassador’s strong position on the subject. (The King
                            has been told of the Ambassador’s return to the Chief of Protocol of a
                            watch given him as a gift and of his practice of rounding up and
                            returning valuable gifts given to American official visitors).
                            Discussing corruption with the King is an extreme step whose negative
                            effects would probably outweigh the benefits: The King is aware of the
                            high living of his brothers and disapproves. He also knows that there is
                            a certain amount of graft in the awarding of contracts. He tries to curb
                            both. Even a respected outsider’s raising the subject with him would
                            cause him intense embarrassment. The approach might eliminate particular
                            instances of corruption, but the general practice will not be so easily
                            stamped out. Certain Princes, [<hi rend="italic">name not
                                declassified</hi>], would be certain to learn of the Ambassador’s
                            action. Whether their names were mentioned (and they wouldn’t be by the
                            Ambassador) they would very probably regard the initiative as having
                            been directed against themselves and their positions of power. The
                            effect would be to endanger the Ambassador’s effectiveness with those
                            who might soon be in power.</p>
                        <p>A more promising approach might be made directly to [<hi rend="italic"
                                >names not declassified</hi>] when specific instances of corruption
                            involving <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests come to our
                            attention. If the action were taken in the context of saving their own
                            and the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s reputation from blemish
                            due to practices of which they must be unaware, the tactic might have
                            some effect.</p>
                        <p>We are likely to be most effective in connection with the activities of
                            the Joint Security and Joint Economic Commissions. The Embassy
                            recommends that in connection with the activities of the commission we
                            constantly emphasize to our Saudi counterparts that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> government will not become a party to
                            facilitating corruption and that we will not permit our contracting
                            procedures nor our experts to be used to promote payments to any Prince
                            or powerful minister. We should emphasize to Saudi officials from the
                            King on down that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will
                            disassociate itself from any contract given on the basis of corruption
                            (since proving corruption would be difficult and that is not our
                            business, in practice we must insist upon contracts being let in
                            accordance with pre-set guidelines.)</p>
                        <p>Reasonable fees for agents are one thing but when a fee reaches over 15%
                            of a contract and is obviously going to the person who is <pb
                                facs="0477" n="442" xml:id="pg_442"/> responsible for awarding the
                            contract, we should remove our umbrella of identification with the
                            contract and the corrupt personalities. (We can do this quietly or with
                            some publicity if we judge it might have a positive effect). We should
                            resist being influenced by the possibility of losing export sales or
                            short term political or military policy considerations. We might lose a
                            little in the short run but we would have as allies the King and many
                            others in the Kingdom who wish to see corruption checked. The longer
                            term result will be even greater use of the American channel for
                            important contracts and, more importantly we would maintain the
                            presently very high esteem of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            within Saudi society. Our own <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            government reputation for incorruptability may one day prove to be our

                        </opener>
                        <p>I am pleased to have received your three letters summing up the important
                            issues discussed and the agreements reached during our recent meetings.
                            The information you provided during our frank discussions and in your
                            letters has been most useful in helping me pinpoint a number of areas in
                            need of special attention. I am most appreciative for the information
                            you have given me.</p>
                        <p>You may be assured that the entire range of subjects which we discussed
                            during your recent visit to the United States has my personal concern
                            and will have my continuing attention to see that all subjects <pb
                                facs="0478" n="443" xml:id="pg_443"/> are given due consideration.
                            The appropriate organizations in the Department of Defense are obtaining
                            the necessary information and taking the actions required to respond to
                            your requests. Some areas, as I am sure you will understand, are more
                            complicated than others and require more time to reach a suitable
                            solution. I’m sure you and your staff are already receiving information
                            through <gloss target="#t_USMTM_1">USMTM</gloss> and our Embassy as a
                            result of your visit here and your meeting in November with Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> and you may
                            expect to receive more information soon. I am determined that we will
                            carry out fully those things to which we have already agreed.</p>
                        <p>I believe that one of the understandings we have reached concerning your
                            interests in aircraft and associated weapons systems, by itself, clearly
                            demonstrates my Department’s fundamental, forthcoming attitude toward
                            Saudi Arabia. Problems are sure to arise from time to time in carrying
                            out your very extensive modernization program but I trust that neither
                            side will allow such difficulties to obscure the sound fundamental
                            relationship between them.</p>
                        <p>I have also received your letter of 2 December concerning medical
                            treatment for Saudi military personnel and their families at various
                            military installations in the United States. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>’s staff has contacted your
                            Military Attaché to obtain more information with a view to resolving the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Your Royal Highness, I wish to thank you for your kind letter of
                            4 December. I am most pleased that you and your delegation were
                            favorably impressed with your visit to Washington and your tour of the
                            United States. I look forward to steady progress in the modernization of
                            your Defense Forces and our continued cooperation in that endeavor.</p>
                        <p>Please accept the renewed assurance of my highest esteem.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Jack.</p>
                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: The Joint Commission program is going forward. We had two
                            good meetings, one on Iran and one on Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: With whom?</p>
                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: The heads of the committees that make up the Joint
                            Commission. We selected a Director for Coordination. We think we are
                            moving in the direction that—</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: We have to have one commission that does something
                            massive. And I think Iran is eager to do it.</p>
                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: That is the reason I called this meeting.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: And I would like to have a meeting of the Joint
                            Commission. I want to have Ansary over here during March.</p>
                        <p>MR. SOBER: He has promised to come. We are waiting for firm dates. It is
                            the first week in March.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Okay. I am going to see the heads of the Indian
                            Commission.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: Just the Cultural Sub-Committee.</p>
                        <p>MR. SOBER: No, sir—all three—the three-sub-committees—4:30.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: I thought you meant the people who were—</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: The heads.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: Yes.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: I don’t think much is going to happen in that
                            commission. How is the Saudi?</p>
                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: I think we are beginning to get that on track. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS_1">Sid Sober</persName> can report in more detail,
                            perhaps. But we have <persName corresp="#p_PG_1">Parsky</persName>, I
                            think, now responsive to our direction. I am told that may be a false
                            hope. But at least it looks that way at the moment.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Let me know if there is a problem.</p>
                        <pb facs="0480" n="445" xml:id="pg_445"/>
                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: He left last night. He has a three-day meeting in Saudi
                            Arabia. Two of our men—<persName corresp="#p_BJ_2">Joel
                                Biller</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DM_1">Morris
                                Draper</persName>—are going with him. And I think we have clearly
                            established the guidelines and he promised to stay within them. We will
                            see.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: He has no background. That is one of the problems.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: What is his background?</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: He is a lawyer. But he just has not had the experience.
                            Very eager.</p>
                        <p>SECREATARY KISSINGER: But he doesn’t understand what the commissions are
                            supposed to do. That’s the first thing.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: We have tried to drum it into him.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: The second thing—he doesn’t know how to deal with
                            the Saudis. His job is not to reform Saudi society. His job is to create
                            as many links between the Saudis and us as can be created, and to do
                            things that they cannot think of.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: He doesn’t have the background in their society, either,
                            to understand how it operates.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: That’s putting it kindly.</p>
                        <p>Okay.</p>

                        <p>1. You may have read some of my messages on the growing Saudi nervousness
                            arising from repeated reports from Israel and the United States on the
                            necessity of occupying the Arab oil producing countries, notably Saudi
                            Arabia. You may also have noted the limited reassurances I’ve given the
                            Saudis (ref A&amp;B) which anticipated the Department’s instructions

                            there is any considered purpose behind them, it probably is to warn the
                            Saudis of the consequences of another oil embargo in the event of
                            another Arab-Israeli war.</p>
                        <p>3. There is no doubt that King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> is worried and his worry is shared by <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>, Sultan, <persName
                                corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> and others. They fear that the
                            United States, in a misguided zeal to support Israeli conquests, will
                            bring down disaster on itself, on the Middle East and on the entire
                            world. And they interpret the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            threats as proof that Zionist influence in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> is undiminished. There is however no disposition to
                            foreswear the oil boycott as a weapon.</p>
                        <p>4. If the war does start and if we come to Israel’s aid as we did in
                            1973, I am convinced the boycott is inevitable. If the war starts and
                            Israel does very well using the massive arms deliveries we have made in
                            the last year, then the boycott is almost equally certain—although in
                            this case we could conceivably preserve something. If the war is a
                            stand-off, then I think the chances of avoiding the boycott would be at
                            least twenty-five percent.</p>
                        <pb facs="0482" n="447" xml:id="pg_447"/>
                        <p>5. The result of the threatening press articles has been a series of
                            meetings between <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> and
                            other Saudi leaders with the Western European Ambassadors (I’m not sure
                            about Japan) where the Saudis are apparently doing everything they can
                            to ensure there will be no consumer solidarity. The point they seem to
                            be making is they do not intend destruction of Israel, they are willing
                            to reach peace but if Israel is not, there will be war. And the Saudis
                            will expect European support. If they get it there will be no cutoff of
                            oil deliveries to them—only to the United States, and if United States
                            invades them, then all oil supplies will be lost.</p>
                        <p>6. I also strongly suspect the Saudis are already taking measures to
                            ensure destruction of the oil installations in Dhahran. I asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> point-blank about
                            this; he laughed and said “you don’t really think I would tell you, the
                            American Ambassador, what we intend to do, do you?” I told him there
                            would be some utility in our knowing Saudi intentions; they would be
                            carefully considered in the United States. He made no comment other than
                            to repeat that he knew the United States well; he was convinced that its
                            support of Israel would stop short of provoking its own destruction and
                            that of its allies. But if we lost our minds we could rest assured that
                            there would not be enough oil left in the Persian Gulf to run the
                            smallest European state; and production would be out for a decade.</p>
                        <p>7. Sultan made the same statements to me somewhat less boldly earlier

                        <p>1. Please convey following letter from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin message: Your Majesty: I am writing you again so soon because I
                            believe it essential that we remain in close touch in this period of
                            intensive diplomatic activity in which we are now engaged to achieve
                            further agreements on the path to a just and lasting peace in the Middle
                            East.</p>
                        <p>There is much irresponsible and uninformed speculation in the world today
                            about American policy, and I want your Majesty to have a correct picture
                            of what our policy is. There must be no misunderstandings between
                            ourselves and our friends in the Middle East, because misunderstandings
                            can only erode the mutual confidence which has been so essential in our
                            relationship and provide opportunity for those whose interests are
                            contrary to ours to profit.</p>
                        <p>I sense from Your Majesty’s response to my last letter that you share
                            these views. I fully reciprocate your strong desire to strengthen the
                            friendship which exists between our two persons and countries. I also
                            recognize that early progress toward peace in the Middle East is
                            essential to preserve the positive results already achieved and to
                            maintain an atmosphere in which the friendship between the United States
                            and the Arab world can further prosper.</p>
                        <p>As I previously wrote to Your Majesty, we are determined to move forward
                            quickly toward a new agreement that will return substantial additional
                            territory to Arab control. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> and I will be <pb facs="0484" n="449"
                                xml:id="pg_449"/> meeting next week with Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_AY_1">Allon</persName> to impress upon him the need for
                            Israel to cooperate in this effort. Thereafter, in response to a
                            suggestion by President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>, I
                            have agreed in principle that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> should travel to the Middle East in the first
                            part of February to seek to move matters toward a successful conclusion.
                            We are now engaged in laying the groundwork so that such a trip by him
                            will have a reasonable prospect of achieving the desired results, since
                            failure to do so would constitute a serious setback to all our hopes.
                            This will be a difficult period for us, and we will need steadfast
                            encouragement and confidence of Your Majesty and our other friends in
                            the area. Your forthcoming visits to Damascus and Cairo are therefore
                            most timely.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, I have been disturbed by tendentious and misleading
                            reports in a number of Arab countries about remarks Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> made recently in response to
                            a question as to what American policy would be if faced with concerted
                            economic warfare threatening to strangle the non-Communist
                            industrialized world. I have been pleased to note that no such comments
                            have emanated from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> will have explained to Your
                            Majesty’s government what our true policy is in this regard. In fact,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s remarks
                            were designed to put a stop to irresponsible talk about reckless
                            military or political action on the price issue. I would also like to
                            reemphasize what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> told you when you last received him that the
                            friendly relations between Saudi Arabia and the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> preclude military threats between us. I trust that
                            Your Majesty will continue to use your wise influence to make clear that
                            the United States follows responsible policies designed to bring about
                            peace and cooperation in the world.</p>
                        <p>As we move forward on the course we have set for ourselves, I will be
                            strengthened by Your Majesty’s words of hope that we shall succeed in
                            attaining the just and permanent peace we all seek in the Middle
                            East.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald R. Ford</persName>.</p>

                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> We are following your efforts and hope they
                            will be crowned with success.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> It is more difficult every
                            month.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> That is true. It often happens that the
                            difficulties increase, but this often means relief is at hand. When
                            matters reach their ultimate depth, they can only go up. It is my belief
                            that the Arab-Israeli problem is one of the most difficult.</p>

                            meet the King?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> Yes.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> I will give His Majesty a detailed
                            explanation of our efforts but I want to say one thing now. We must
                            conduct our policy in difficult circumstances and under great domestic
                            difficulties. Your Highness is aware of the attacks on us. Your Highness
                            is also aware of the complicated situation in the Middle East. Israel’s
                            interest is to complicate matters further. But we have no interest in
                            dividing the Arab world.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> That goes without saying.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> I began 15 months ago because I was
                            convinced that American relations with the Arab world must be improved.
                            I wanted America’s oldest Arab friends to be proud of American actions
                            and not have to apologize for them.</p>
                        <pb facs="0486" n="451" xml:id="pg_451"/>
                        <p>We are prepared to make the same effort for Syria as we are for Egypt.
                            Your Highness knows that the Syrian problem is more complicated, but our
                            intention is to help in the same way. I know this must be of concern to
                            Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> True. We feel that what has been achieved
                            since October 1973 in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Arab
                            relations is substantial. And in the proper perspective, the improvement
                            has been great compared with the absence of good relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in the Arab world in the
                            previous period. This has enabled your friends to speak up and to give
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> credit for what it is doing.
                            This is consonant with His Majesty’s desire to see us move along this
                            path.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> His Majesty always encouraged
                            us.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> True. His Majesty’s policy has not been
                            confined to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi relations, but he
                            has wanted an improvement in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            relations with all the Arabs.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> That has been our impression. His
                            Majesty has used his influence to that end.</p>
                        <p>I think Your Highness understands English perfectly. You have an unfair
                            advantage. You can reflect on your replies.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> My English is limited and confined to
                            personal matters. One must hear some things in one’s own language to be
                            sure he understands.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> That is true. I never negotiate in a
                            foreign language.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> That way your replies are as you want
                            them.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> Absolutely.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> It is my belief that Israel should be made to
                            realize that these are the most opportune circumstances for peace. This
                            is so because the Arab side is closer and closer to the conviction that
                            a peaceful settlement is the best solution. If matters drag on, the
                            Arabs will come to believe that the only solution is to increase their
                            armaments. This will be dangerous.</p>
                        <p>I feel the Soviets may not want the solution we want.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> The Soviets want no solution.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> That is because they benefit from the
                            situation. Hence pro-Soviet elements seek to distort your efforts, which
                            we hope will succeed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> If our friends continue to support
                            us, we are closer than ever to the next stage; it should be in the next
                            few weeks.</p>

                        <p>One way to give you more advanced aircraft would be to send them with

                            would see the physical presence of the aircraft which would have great

                            training personnel. As I said to you in Washington, we want to see these

                            South Yemen. We are surprised that Somalia is rushing into a venture not
                            in its interest, since Somalia is part of the Arab family and none of
                            its members is urging this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> Excellent. I find this strange. The Somalia
                            Foreign Minister was here a month ago and told me that Somalia was
                            seeking to distance itself from the Soviets. Then one week ago they
                            executed ten Muslim holy men.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> That will be helpful. When the Somalia
                            Foreign Minister was here, I said that I know you have economic
                            problems. If you seek to distance yourself from the Soviets, we are
                            prepared to help you economically. But if you follow a path that is of
                            no use to Somalia and the Arab world, we cannot help. I told the Foreign
                            Minister to heed the lesson of Egypt and the Sudan. Why start from the
                            point that Egypt is trying to get out of?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> That was a good point.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Eritrea and Ethiopia, we would welcome Saudi Arabia’s
                            help. There are no American interests in Ethiopia per se, but we don’t
                            want Eritrea taken over by Chinese influence internally and by the
                            Soviets from outside.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> That is true. I also think that Ethiopia
                            should be asked to use other than military methods.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> I agree. We think some of the
                            Ethiopian leaders are crazy and immature.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> True. Some Ethiopian leaders came to Jidda to
                            see His Majesty, who said we don’t care about what kind of Government
                            you have; we will help if you follow a moderate policy toward Eritrea.
                            If Ethiopia does not do so, it will leave the door open to the Communist
                            Chinese and Eastern Europeans.</p>

                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> In Ethiopian minds, the need for a Red Sea
                            outlet looms large. But with reason, Eritrea could be autonomous and

                                >Fahd</persName>:</hi> Because of the geographical proximity to
                            Saudi Arabia, we are anxious to see an amicable solution. We fear that a
                            Qaddafi will fight the flames of that conflict.</p>

                                    >Kissinger</persName>:</hi> That is our view.</p>
                        <p>Is enough being done about South Yemen?</p>

                            well. We are trying to convince South Yemen that cooperation with Saudi
                            Arabia and the Gulf is better for them than with the Communists. It is
                            always better to have these side talks than confrontation. We want no
                            more problems in our area. South Yemen gets no benefit from being close
                            to the Communist world.</p>

                            problems for North Yemen, Oman and the Gulf. South Yemen is being used
                            for purposes that are neither in their or our interests. We are trying
                            to make them understand that if they leave the Communist camp and return
                            to the Arab fold, this will be infinitely better for them.</p>

                        <p>Summary: MinInterior Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>
                            in discussions with Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1"
                                >Robinson</persName> placed great emphasis on strengthening the
                            military potential of Saudi Arabia to make her a key element in
                            stabilizing the entire Gulf and Peninsula. He also argued that such
                            military strengthening was necessary if Saudi Arabia were to play a full
                            role in leading the oil states away from radical policies. Only if such
                            countries as Kuwait and North Yemen Saudi Arabia was capable of
                            protecting them from such radical powers as Iraq and South Yemen could
                            she play this role which would promote <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> interests throughout the area. He specifically asked
                            for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> evaluation of the purchase of
                            F–15 fighters as one important step and said that the Saudi military
                            were dissatisfied with the amount of material and the speed with which
                            they were receiving <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military
                            equipment, drawing comparisons with the Soviet supply of Syria. The
                            Prince said that there was a group within the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> who were seeking to have the Kingdom turn to reliance
                            on Europe for a major share in developing the country both militarily
                            and on the civilian side. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> said that he wanted to maintain the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> connection but needed help to do so.
                            He painted a picture of even larger involvement by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and private American companies in
                            developing the agriculture and industry of the Kingdom provided the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> oriented group within the
                            government continued to be successful. The Under Secretary noted our
                            intention to send a high-ranking <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Defense Department official to Saudi Arabia as soon as possible along
                            the lines discussed with the Secretary the previous day and suggested
                            that Saudi Arabia meanwhile could assist the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> by reassuring Syria on the intentions of the Secretary
                            in seeking to really resolve the problem of the conflict in the Middle
                            East. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> also has a new and
                            broader plan for developing agriculture in the Kingdom and in developing
                            the fertilizer industry. The Prince said that he was seeing the <pb
                                facs="0491" n="456" xml:id="pg_456"/> Syrian Foreign Minister later
                            that day and would make every effort to support the initiatives of the
                            Secretary. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>, Minister of
                            Interior and effective operating head of the Saudi Government, in a
                            February 10 meeting, originally scheduled for 45 minutes but which
                            lasted over two hours, with Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1"
                                >Robinson</persName> dwelt at length on his long history of
                            supporting the American connection among Saudi policy makers. He
                            concentrated on necessity for developing a more credible Saudi military
                            establishment arguing that only if this happened and quickly would Saudi
                            Arabia be able to play its full role both in the Gulf and in the
                            Peninsula as a whole. This would be very much in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interest because Saudi Arabia as a
                            matter of policy still sought a reduction in the price of petroleum and
                            wanted to continue process of weaning smaller states from fear of and
                            dependence on the radical Arab states in area, namely Iraq and South
                            Yemen.</p>
                        <p>2. The Prince emphasized that the situation had changed with regard to
                            relations with the Gulf states since his efforts to settle border
                            dispute with Abu Dhabi. These states were no longer fearful of Saudi
                            Arabia and indeed Saudi Arabia, he said several times, did not have any
                            aggressive intentions whatsoever. It was extremely important to arm
                            Saudi Arabia with modern weapons that would be believable. He knew there
                            were elements in Congress and in <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>
                            who sought to portray Saudi intentions as wanting to use such arms
                            against her neighbors or even against Israel. He wanted to give
                            assurances that Saudi Arabia would never attack Israel. The arms were
                            needed purely for their own protection and to balance the arms being
                            sent to the radical states in the area.</p>
                        <p>3. Developing the theme further, Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> said that several officers, both those still in
                            Syria during his recent visit there and those in Tabuk and Khamis
                            Mushayt had openly expressed to him their shame and concern regarding
                            Saudi weakness relative to these radical states. He wanted an evaluation
                            made of the F–15 aircraft and its availability to Saudi Arabia. The
                            Kingdom’s military weakness led to serious problems in making Saudi
                            policy leadership effective and believable in other areas such as
                            energy. Saudi Arabia still had as its policy that the price of petroleum
                            should come down. The ULF states were following her lead but Kuwait was
                            not and this was mostly because of her fear of Iraq. If Kuwait felt that
                            she could rely on Saudi Arabia her fear of Iraq might largely
                            disappear.</p>
                        <p>4. There was a group, another group inside the Saudi Government, which
                            opposed placing such reliance on the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> for military and civilian development of the Kingdom.
                            Even now the Europeans were opening their arms to Saudi Arabia and
                            promising that they were ready to cooperate in all fields. It was
                            becoming embarrassing to the Prince to <pb facs="0492" n="457"
                                xml:id="pg_457"/> have so little to show for the efforts made so far
                            with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in both military and
                            civilian fields. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> must find ways
                            to strengthen the Saudis’ military.</p>
                        <p>5. Turning to the economic development of the Kingdom, the Prince said
                            that they were most concerned about agriculture. The Kingdom had
                            adequate water resources and soil and they were keen on making the
                            country self-sufficient. We do not care about the expense he said so
                            long as it is economically sound in the long run. In industry, they
                            wished to develop some light industry to meet consumption needs within
                            the Kingdom and perhaps export to Gulf area. Joint ventures with Saudi
                            citizens were needed and the Joint Commission could be helpful on
                            this.</p>
                        <p>6. The Under Secretary said that he could not assure the Prince that the
                            F–15’s could be delivered but this would be reported to Secretary. Plans
                            had been laid to send out a high ranking Department of Defense official
                            as soon as possible. There was much appreciation for the efforts of
                            Saudi Arabia and of the Prince in helping to resolve the problem of the
                            relations of Syria and the other states with Israel, and for its help in
                            establishing the close friendly relations that now existed between Egypt
                            and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> He noted with appreciation
                            the efforts of the Prince on continuation of the Bahrain naval facility
                            for the United States. The Secretary had promised that there would soon
                            be a visit by a high-ranking Department of Defense official to review
                            Saudi military needs. Insofar as the economic development effort, the
                            Secretary had made him responsible for following the work of all of the
                            Commissions and this would have the highest priority. They had prepared
                            a new agricultural program which would be discussed with the Minister of
                            Agriculture later the same day.</p>

                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: We have the Saudi Arabian Commission meeting starting here
                            in a few minutes. We have run into a problem. The problem is developing
                            over the exclusion of Jews from any of these contractual arrangements.
                            We are going to have to try to work it out. And I think there are
                            solutions. But it is going to create—</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Like what? Like <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> converting? That way he can also go to
                            Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: We think perhaps if we exclude any reference to religion in
                            soliciting contracts, and let the Saudis make their own decisions.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: How about race?</p>
                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: Race and religion.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Both?</p>
                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: I don’t know.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Get that word around, will you, McCloskey. We are
                            against discrimination on the grounds of race and religion.</p>
                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: It is going to be a problem.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Does anyone seriously believe that we are going to
                            change the Saudis?</p>
                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: I don’t. But I think that perhaps in the way we handle it
                            on this end, we can avoid the kind of criticism that is building up.</p>

                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: The criticism that is building up is the same kind
                            as with the Jackson amendment—people who want to interrupt the Saudi
                            relationship. There is nothing new about what the Saudis are doing.</p>
                        <pb facs="0494" n="459" xml:id="pg_459"/>
                        <p>MR. ROBINSON: Just that we are expanding our relationship with them, a
                            government-to-government relationship, that brings the issue into
                            focus.</p>
                        <p>MR. SISCO: The other side of the coin, Henry, is the boycott that the
                            Arabs are making a matter of importance publicly themselves.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: That is a different problem. The problem of
                            boycotting in the United States—that is one thing. That we should
                            resist. The question of whom they take into their country is another
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>MR. SISCO: I realize they are two different problems. But I happen to
                            believe that is part of the overall problem. And it is being played as
                            such. Sure they are two different problems.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: I know what is being played.</p>

                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> from Ambassador. Subject:
                            Reactions to Current Anti-Saudi Campaign. Ref State 45186. From
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. We are beginning to get reactions to the current anti-Saudi campaign
                            in the States. There has been, as yet, no official statement, and there
                            may not be but the press is beginning to take up the cry.</p>
                        <pb facs="0495" n="460" xml:id="pg_460"/>
                        <p>2. The Arab boycott of Israel: The Governor of the Central Bank (SAMA)
                            told me we should understand Saudi Arabia would invest where it wanted
                            and through whatever banks it wished. It would not deal with banks on
                            the Israeli boycott list. If we don’t like this, he said, then they will
                            go elsewhere. He asked how the Israeli boycott differed from our boycott
                            of firms or of ships dealing with Cuba or of the boycott of certain
                            transactions with Communist countries—even by European affiliates of
                            American firms.</p>
                        <p>3. He said the Arabs had considered a significant relaxing of the boycott
                            rules [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>], but in view of
                            the current campaign in the United States this would now be very
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>4. It should be noted that Saudi Arabia in the last year has invested
                            almost $1 billion in <gloss target="#t_FNMA_1">FNMA</gloss> debentures
                            and has bought or committed itself to over $4 billion in Treasury
                            notes.</p>
                        <p>5. Visa for Jews: Congressman Waxman, who was not a member of the House
                            Foreign Armed Forces Committee, got onto the Committee’s tour of the
                            Middle East apparently solely to raise the question of visas for Jews.
                            He asked King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> why Jews
                            were not permitted freely into the Kingdom and the King asked why they
                            would want to come. Most Jews, said the King, support Israel.</p>
                        <p>6. We have made extraordinary progress through quiet diplomats in getting
                            visas for Jews since I have been here—as you know and as <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHH_1">Hal Saunders</persName> testified before Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName>. It has not been
                            particularly easy but every Jewish applicant has come in with the sole
                            exception of Joe Kraft—and I finally got that arranged.</p>
                        <p>7. Now as a direct result of the publicity, the reaction has set in. A
                            Colonel David Berg (or Burg) has apparently recently applied for a visa
                            in Washington in connection with some Air Force survey (we have no
                            details from the Saudis; and our military mission knows nothing about
                            him). The Acting Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Muhammad Mas’ud,
                            asked me last week if I thought they should allow him in. I said of
                            course; to refuse him a visa now would cause tremendous problems. He
                            referred the matter to Prince Sultan, Minister of Defense, who has just
                            replied through the Foreign Ministry that we could, in effect, take
                            Colonel Berg and shove him. Visa matters are the perogative of every
                            sovereign state, the Foreign Minister quoted him as saying, and he added
                            that the United States is extraordinarily careful about letting anyone
                            into the country who might harm it. The Arabs must assume that Colonel
                            Berg could report everything he learned in Saudi Arabia to the Israeli
                            Embassy in Washington. If we insist, too bad; but Colonel Berg will not
                                <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not come into Saudi Arabia. The
                            Saudis are prepared for whatever consequences this might bring. I doubt,
                            incidentally, that I will now be able to get Joseph Kraft in. And visas
                            for all Jews will be harder to get.</p>
                        <pb facs="0496" n="461" xml:id="pg_461"/>
                        <p>8. The Embassy leases: We have long-term leases on two large pieces of
                            property in Jidda and Dhahran. The Dhahran lease expires the end of next
                            year and the Jidda lease 8 months later. I’ve been trying to get both
                            extended on the same terms, i.e. no rent. The Jidda property—42 acres—is
                            now worth over $60 million. The Dhahran property—65 acres—is worth over
                            $40 million. The head of the political section of the Foreign Ministry,
                            who is handling the lease renewals, has just told me they will not
                                <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not renew the leases in view of
                            the extraordinary campaign conducted against Saudi Arabia in the United
                            States. He asked how he could justify this “gift” to us today. He
                            suggested we buy the land; “you’re a rich country.”</p>
                        <p>9. Saudi Arabia in <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>: Our wireless
                            bulletin tells us this morning about the extraordinary role Saudi Arabia
                            is playing in <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> to keep oil prices
                            down in spite of the opposition of every other country in <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>; Saudis find themselves under attack
                            from other quarters (especially the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Congress) and hear nothing positive about their actions in Vienna. I
                            believe Saudi Arabia in anger may weaken under pressure from fellow
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> members unless it feels it
                            receives more support and understanding from the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss></p>
                        <p>10. The invasion threats: Omar Shams, Saudi Director of Intelligence,
                            told an EmbOff recently that the Saudi Government is convinced that the
                            various invasion articles, culminating in the March <hi rend="italic"
                                >Harper’s</hi> article by “Ignotus,” is part of a <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> plan to soften up the American people
                            for attempted occupation of the Arabian Peninsula. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_KRT_1">Kennedy</persName> proposal to stop arms
                            deliveries to the Persian Gulf is considered part of this strategy. In
                            an extraordinarily bitter outburst, Shams said that from now on the
                            Arabs must consider the United States as “an extension of Israel”; as
                            “Israel’s tool in the Middle East.”</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>11. Comment: Neither our allies who see themselves in the position of
                            picking up the pieces of the military/commercial empire we have
                            carefully constructed here since the October War, nor our enemies who
                            see us voluntarily giving up our influence in the Arabian Peninsula,
                            will be particularly unhappy with these developments. There is not too
                            much we can do here to counter the inflammatory stories out of
                            Washington. You will have to handle them. We will, of course, do what we
                            can to keep the Saudis calm.</p>
                        <p>12. Information requested:</p>
                        <p>A) Who is Colonel David Berg? Why does he need a visa for Saudi
                            Arabia?</p>
                        <p>B) We have heard nothing about the reaction of the Saudi team in
                            Washington to all this. How did they take the cancellation of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Simon</persName>/Aba al-Khail press
                            conference? The formal announcements which we <pb facs="0497" n="462"
                                xml:id="pg_462"/> have received in our news bulletins are fine; but
                            there must have been some private reaction. If not, I suspect the Saudis
                            are holding it in and I’ll get an ear-full when they come back.</p>
                        <p>13. Action I will take here:</p>
                        <p>A) I will see Prince Sultan, Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> and Omar Shams soon; ask them to remain calm; tell
                            them they must not allow themselves the gratification of an open or
                            hostile reaction to the threats and statements from individuals in the
                            United States. This could only make matters worse and would play into
                            the hands of those who want to disrupt our relations. The administration
                            attaches great importance to good relations with Saudi Arabia; many
                            Members of Congress share this opinion, as does the overwhelming mass of
                            American businessmen.</p>
                        <p>B) I will ask Sultan to give a visa to Colonel Berg, provided he is a
                            bona fide <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> officer on official
                            business.</p>
                        <p>C) I will ask all of them to continue to support actions to relax the
                            Israeli boycott. Anything they do will not necessarily be interpreted as
                            yielding to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> pressure in this field;
                            they had, after all, considered relaxation long before the latest
                            attacks on them.</p>
                        <p>D) I will continue to work on the Embassy and ConGen compound problem.
                            But I do not think there will be much chance of success soon. (I can
                            imagine the reaction in <gloss target="#t_NEAEX_1">NEA/EX</gloss> if
                            faced with a $100 million bill for facilities in Saudi Arabia.) I had
                            earlier suggested that the Saudis give us free-hold to the land, and I
                            thought this idea was catching on until the recent stories from
                            Washington.</p>

                        <p>The importance of the PEACE HAWK V program to the modernization plans of
                            the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is well understood by the United States
                            Government. The program has been subjected to close scrutiny within the
                            Department of Defense because of its size as well as the major role
                            which it has in your plans. The cost of the program will depend, of
                            course, upon the extent of contractor support and facilities
                            construction desired by Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>You should be aware of two particular features of the cost estimate for
                            the program. First, the Letter of Offer includes a $50 million line item
                            for contingencies. The purpose of including this line item is to avoid
                            the need to process additional requests for funds for program additions
                            or price increases not foreseen at the time of contract definition. As
                            these items occur, they will be submitted to you in detail, and fully
                            documented.</p>
                        <p>Second, in addition, the Letter of Offer includes approximately $45
                            million to cover costs involving the Agent’s Fee Agreement between the
                            Northrop Corporation and the Triad Financial Establishment. The
                            Department of Defense is not in a position to assess the appropriateness
                            of this item, and therefore is informing you.</p>
                        <p>I wish to assure you that the United States Department of Defense will
                            provide continuous top level management attention to the PEACE HAWK V
                            Program. Please feel free to bring any program problems to my personal
                            attention.</p>

                            Plans.</p>
                        <p>1. On March 25, shortly after the assassination of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>, the rumor circulated in the
                            eastern province (Dhahran) that the Embassy had put all American
                            citizens on alert and had told them to prepare their passports for
                            departure from the Kingdom. The Acting Consul General denied the reports
                            but Prince Nayef (Deputy Minister of the Interior who had gone to the
                            eastern province) asked that there be an official denial from me. I gave
                            him one. I said we had not expected any disturbances and there were
                            none. American citizens had not been alerted to be prepared to leave; we
                            expected them to stay in the country as, indeed, they did. Nayef was
                            gratified and said he would start an investigation to see who had
                            started the rumors. (Upon receiving word of the assassination the
                            Embassy passed reassurances to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            firms in Jidda and Riyadh, and had Dhahran do so also per Jidda
                            2120.)</p>
                        <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>] the Egyptians had
                            told the Saudis the United States could be reporting disturbances in the
                            country in order to justify military occupation of the eastern province.
                            I saw [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]. He was with [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]. I asked them both about
                            the reports. When [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]
                            confirmed having heard them, I said they were absolute fabrications. I
                            asked [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] how the Egyptians
                            could have reached such a conclusion, much less could have told the
                            Saudis. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] said they had
                            heard two suspicious press releases from the Pentagon. The first one was
                            that the Seventh Fleet had been alerted; the second that it could be put
                            on full alert soon. He had no further details.</p>
                        <p>3. I told [<hi rend="italic">names not declassified</hi>] I thought this
                            was irresponsible. I had heard no such report in connection with the
                            Middle East—and I would have if it had been made. The Seventh Fleet
                            possibly could have been put on alert due to the situation in Cambodia,
                            but it certainly had nothing to do with Saudi Arabia and it was clearly
                            wrong to tell the Saudis something so pernicious.</p>

                        <p>4. Vice President <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rockefeller</persName>
                            raised the matter with Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>, who said that the Saudis indeed had been disturbed
                            by the talks of invasion and by the distortions of Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s remarks made by the
                            American press and certain American writers. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> spoke of my press interview a
                            few weeks ago which he said had a positive effect in Saudi Arabia and
                            the rest of the Arab world and made the work of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> in the Middle East much
                            easier. He was pleased the Secretary had confirmed what I said in his
                            departure statement from Riyadh on March 19. But, he said, the rumors
                            persist that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> has evil
                            intentions toward Saudi Arabia. The Vice President replied that the
                            reports we intended to invade Saudi Arabia were absolutely wrong. He,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> worked closely on
                            matters of policy and he could assure the Prince that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had no such intention.</p>
                        <p>5. Mohammad Mas’ud, Acting Minister of State for Foreign Affairs raised
                            matter once again today. He said that the Saudis were gratified with the
                            Secretary’s statement at Riyadh airport but the Secretary had promised
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> that he would also
                            refer to the matter in his next press conference. Mas’ud said they had
                            seen the account of the March 28 press conference but had read nothing
                            on the subject. He said he hoped the Secretary could soon publicly
                            condemn the invasion articles.</p>
                        <p>6. Comment: The invasion story will probably continue to poison our
                            relations with Saudi Arabia (and the Arabs) until there is a detailed
                            refutation of the invasion concept by a member of the

                        <p>SUMMARY: On 8 April Crown Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> restated Saudi policy of maintaining and promoting
                            friendship and alliance with the United States. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> stated that this is the time
                            when the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> needs friends and Saudi
                            Arabia would be one—openly and proudly. He then outlined his recent
                            directive to the Central Planning Organization that preferences in the
                            new Saudi Five Year Development Plan would go to Americans. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> also briefly discussed the
                            direction of foreign policy and his relations with <persName

                        <p>1. On 8 April 1975, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> in Riyadh to discuss [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] activities in
                            the context of the new leadership changes in Saudi Arabia following the
                            assassination of King Faysal on 25 March. During the course of the
                            meeting, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>],
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> made the following
                            points which may be of interest to you.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> stated, “I am determined
                            that the policy of close working relations with the United States which
                            I began and which has become known as my policy, shall be implemented
                            promptly and fully now that I am in charge. I repeated this to the
                            Central Planning Organization (<gloss target="#t_CPO_1">CPO</gloss>)
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. We are
                            going to be allies and friends of the United States—not privately, but
                            openly and proudly—at a time when the United States needs friends. The
                            only thing I ask in return is that the projects and programs which I
                            discussed with your State, Treasury and Defense Department officials in
                            Washington last June (1974) should be supported without complications or
                            delays that could embarrass me.”</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> had just come from a
                            meeting with the <gloss target="#t_CPO_1">CPO</gloss> officials at which
                            the proposed new Five Year Plan had been reviewed. This plan, <pb
                                facs="0503" n="468" xml:id="pg_468"/> he said had been sitting on
                            King Faysal’s desk for sometime before the assassination, and there had
                            been concern that it would not be approved and implemented in August
                            1975 as originally scheduled. The plan had been given to him for review
                            and he expected that it might now be approved and started even before
                            August. Preferences in the plan will be given to large <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> corporations which are willing not
                            only to provide goods and services to the Saudis’ modernization program,
                            but which are willing to bring training and technology with them as
                            permanent contributions to the improvement of Saudi society. Contracts
                            will be awarded to the Japanese, English, Germans, French and others,
                            but the majority will definitely go to the Americans. This decision,
                            which <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said was his own,
                            had been given substance in the form of a directive to the <gloss
                                target="#t_CPO_1">CPO</gloss> President <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"

                        <p>4. Turning to foreign policy, <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> said that Saudi Arabia’s relations with Egypt will
                            remain as strong as ever. Secondly, <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> said he was looking forward with enthusiasm to a
                            successful trip to Iran, which will now be more important since the
                            death of King Faysal. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>
                            stated emphatically that there was no problem between him and King
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>. He confirmed that
                            the King had issued written instructions to all senior officers of the

                        <p>1. During the past weeks we have seen a number of reports in the press
                            concerning efforts now underway in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> to probe activities of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> firms abroad. Embassy has heard from a reliable
                            businessman that the <gloss target="#t_SEC_1">SEC</gloss> investigation
                            of Northrop activities could produce evidence of Northrop payments to
                            officials as high as [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>]. We have also noted that Lockheed and Raytheon
                            are reportedly under investigation.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe American performance has been significantly “better” in
                            this area than our British and French competitors. Nevertheless, despite
                            our advice that the old payoff system is no longer mandatory, many
                            Western businessmen believe it is a way of life in the Middle East (some
                            of the news articles, of course, indicate the Middle East is not unique
                            in this). No doubt there is some fire under this current smoke
                            screen.</p>
                        <p>3. If widespread publicity is given to allegations of corruption and
                            bribery of Saudi officials the results could be extremely damaging.
                            Bi-lateral relations would almost certainly suffer, and American
                            business with Saudi Arabia would receive a serious setback, especially
                            in the defense field if [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] name were to be directly associated with major
                            otherwise unexplainable payoffs. There might also be an important impact
                            on Saudi society and political stability if [<hi rend="italic">2 lines
                                not declassified</hi>] should come into the [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line not declassified</hi>] light.</p>
                        <p>Despite news censorship, this kind of development could not be kept
                            secret. It might have the effect of exaggerating it. The impact could be
                            even greater at this particular time when lines of authority are still
                            being drawn in the new regime.</p>
                        <p>4. Action requested: We are in no way implying that the Department should
                            interfere in this investigation. We do, however, urgently need whatever
                            advance notice the Department can give us concerning the course of

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss> has carried report that Secretary
                            of Defense <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName> has said
                            we would use “political, economic and even military” means to break

                        <p>2. Saudis are concerned and Foreign Minister has asked us for text of the
                            statement. The Kuwaiti Ambassador asked to see me immediately after his
                            meeting with the Saudi Foreign Minister. The Kuwaiti said, and I presume
                            he was reflecting the views he had just heard, that we would be very
                            mistaken if we thought this revival of the invasion threats would help
                            oil prices or the cause of peace in the area. The Kuwaiti said the
                            timing was the worst possible and asked if we were determined to lose
                            all our Middle East interests or if <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"

                            put off until an indeterminate future date. This follows and may have

                                World Report</hi> on the possible US use of military force in event
                            of an oil embargo. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1"
                                >Akins</persName> is attempting to arrange a meeting between
                                <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> tomorrow, May 21 despite
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s reluctance to see
                                <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName> because of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>’s remarks. Given
                            the importance of our relations with Saudi Arabia, especially at this
                            critical period of our reassessment and our efforts to get Saudi
                            economic cooperation, you may want to try to smooth the ruffled
                            feathers. Here is a suggestion <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1"
                                >Robinson</persName> could pass to <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>, if you think it worthwhile to do something.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin message. Quote The President is concerned by the recent comments
                            by Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                                >Schlesinger</persName> on the subject of possible <pb facs="0508"
                                n="473" xml:id="pg_473"/> US reactions in the event of another oil
                            embargo. The President wants it clearly understood that the United
                            States position remains emphatically as he himself stated it on numerous
                            occasions; that is, that the US does not presently envision the
                            occurrence of any event which could be construed as economic
                            strangulation. The President—in a press conference on January 21,
                            1975—specifically and publicly denied that the imposition of an embargo
                            comparable to the embargo of 1973 would be tantamount to quote
                            strangulation unquote. The President wants it understood that any
                            discussion by US officials under present circumstances of possible US
                            military actions in response to an oil embargo is of an extreme
                            hypothetical nature and does not reflect his views.</p>
                        <p>The President wishes Crown Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> to know that he is strongly committed to a close
                            and cooperative relationship with Saudi Arabia. He would welcome the
                            views of His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince, on how we can move
                            forward together to resolve the broad economic and political problems
                            which concern our two countries. The President wishes to express his
                            regret that the Crown Prince is unable to visit the United States at
                            this time and hopes that they can meet in the very near future. Unquote.
                            For Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>. In
                            transmitting the foregoing message, you can orally explain that the
                            President will be dealing with this problem privately with his officials
                            and believes that further public discussion would serve no useful
                            purpose, at this time.</p>

                            of Force in Event of Oil Embargo. Ref: A. Jidda 3633; B. Jidda 3632.</p>
                        <p>1. Immediately preceding telegrams give factual account of my lengthy
                            sessions (2½ hours total) with King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName> and Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"

                                >Schlesinger</persName>’s remarks on use of military force in event
                            of oil embargo. I conclude that the resultant situation is a cause for
                            serious concern and that we should consider alternatives for remedial
                            action as urged by Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>.
                            Our choices seem to be as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. Ignore the Saudi démarches and do nothing. I think the Saudis are
                            genuinely concerned over both the import of the statements and their
                            effect on our position in the Middle East. To do nothing would heighten
                            their suspicions and permit erosion of our influence with the moderate
                            Arabs.</p>
                        <p>B. Formally disavow <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName>’s
                            remarks. I can imagine the ramifications of doing this, though it
                            appears that <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss> went well beyond
                            your own <hi rend="italic">Business Week</hi> and subsequent remarks
                            concerning an oil embargo that would “strangulate” Western economies. An
                            embargo similar to the ‘73 one would not constitute “strangulation.”</p>
                        <p>C. Issue a positive statement concerning US policy toward the Arabs and
                            particularly Saudi Arabia. Such a statement could reaffirm our
                            commitment to strengthen bilateral relations with the Arabs, our support
                            of territorial integrity in the Middle East, and our dedication to a
                            peaceful solution of the Middle East conflict which would eliminate any
                            consideration of military action. A carefully drawn statement along
                            these lines would probably meet <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>’s request.</p>
                        <p>D. To meet <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s concern over
                            Israeli aggression against northern Saudi Arabia in event of another
                            war, give assurances supporting Saudi Arabian territorial integrity.
                            This could be done separately and <pb facs="0510" n="475"
                                xml:id="pg_475"/> privately, possibly in conjunction with the public
                            statement under alternative (C).</p>
                        <p>2. On basis of my knowledge from here I would recommend course (C), with
                            possible combination with (D). I would be glad to discuss this further
                            with you on my return to Washington May 23.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Cutler said Northrop wanted to give State and Defense a status report
                            on the question of commission fees, now being investigated by the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> Subcommittee and the
                                <gloss target="#t_SEC_1">SEC</gloss>. The Northrop representatives
                            were calling on Defense (Hoffman) May 23. Cutler asked Willens, who
                            recently visited the area, to take the lead.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Willens said Northrop viewed the situation regarding commissions in
                            Iran as “tolerable and survivable”. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HRM_1">Helms</persName> had <pb facs="0511" n="476"
                                xml:id="pg_476"/> agreed with this assessment, according to Mr.
                            Willens. The Acting Secretary wondered if the worst cases of commission
                            payments had occurred before the Shah took steps to rectify the
                            situation. Mr. Willens agreed; thereafter Northrop had taken appropriate
                            steps to avoid commission payments except for actual services rendered.
                            (Later in the discussion Mr. Willens said Northrop was looking into
                            allegations that “some very minor payments” were made to tax collection
                            officials by one of Northrop’s Iranian agents.)</p>
                        <p>With regard to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Willens said the situation was “very
                            difficult”. In 1972 <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Adnan
                                Khashoggi</persName> (Triad) had sought and received from Northrop a
                            payment of $250,000 which <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName> averred had been demanded by the then
                            Commander of the Royal Saudi Air Force. Six months later the then Deputy
                            Commander (now Commander—Lt. Gen. Zuhair) of the <gloss
                                target="#t_RSAF_1">RSAF</gloss> had demanded $200,000, according to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>, and this amount
                            was paid to the latter by Northrop for transmittal. After these payments
                            were discussed with <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>, they were
                            deemed not allowable in the context of the pertinent <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> case, and they have now been “netted
                            out”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM_1">Feldman</persName> noted that this
                            $450,000 was peanuts compared to the $45 million which <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> was reportedly obtaining as
                            his 5% of Northrop’s Phase IV program in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Cutler said
                            the $45 million cited by <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> was
                            inaccurate. <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> was due 5%
                            only on the Northrop portion of the program, i.e., only a $20 million
                            fee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MC_1">Maw</persName> said State would be
                            working out with <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> in the near future
                            a policy with regard to payment of commissions and agents fees in Saudi
                            Arabia. Tentatively we had concluded that no commissions should be paid
                            in connection with <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> cases, except of
                            course for actual services rendered. There followed an exchange on the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> Subcommittee’s
                            investigation, with focus on Section 4 of the Ernst and Ernst audit
                            report. Mr. Cutler noted that the report cites the name of Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> (presumably,

                            was acknowledged by the participants that much of the information which

                                Barger</persName>, formerly head of <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO_1"
                                >ARAMCO</gloss> and now an outside director of Northrop, to Saudi
                            Arabia in early June to consult with pertinent Saudi officials. The
                            Acting Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MC_1">Maw</persName>
                            agreed it was wise to inform the Saudi Government in advance of probable
                            publicity regarding commission payments. (Note: See also Jidda
                            3378.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Willens asked the Department to consider whether Northrop should make
                            an effort with the <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName>
                            Subcommittee to withhold the names of the two Saudi generals as well as
                            information which would enable their easy identity, and whether the
                            Department might make <pb facs="0512" n="477" xml:id="pg_477"/> such an
                            effort. Mr. Cutler thought that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                            >USG</gloss>’s foreign relations interest would be the only basis for
                            confidentiality and that the Government should raise that concern. The
                            Acting Secretary opined that disclosure of the names would be of no
                            value, and noted the possibility of unfairness to the individuals
                            concerned, particularly in view of the uncertainty whether they received
                            the payments.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question Mr. Cutler said that in Saudi Arabia, Northrop
                            normally included a 5% commission in <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> cases, and a 10–12% commission on direct sale cases.
                            The French paid commissions up to 20%, and if US companies were
                            forbidden to pay any commissions, other parties would likely get most of
                            the sales. Northrop favored the disclosure to the local government of
                            all commission payments and diplomatic efforts to encourage other
                            exporting countries to join us against payment of commissions. Mr.
                            Cutler noted that <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>
                            reportedly was peddling the story that Northrop itself had instigated
                            the current controversy over commissions, in order to wiggle out of its
                            commitments to him. Mr. Willens returned to the question of the broader
                            US/Saudi bilateral interests, not permitting this commission question to
                            disrupt such important elements of our relationship as Northrop’s
                            extensive involvement in Saudi Arabia. He thought the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> might react strongly against
                            disclosure of high level corruption. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LM_1"
                                >Leigh</persName> said we regarded the United Brands case as a
                            precedent, i.e., we cannot be in a position of giving advice on
                            disclosure and cannot intervene. Granting this, Mr. Cutler said,
                            Northrop wanted to be as helpful as it could, in the interests of our
                            bilateral relations and its own self-interest, and therefore would like
                            to have the Department’s and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1"
                                >Akins</persName>’ thoughts on how to minimize damage in Saudi
                            Arabia. The Acting Secretary said we would seek Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName>’ views now, and agreed it would
                            be well if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> called on
                            the Ambassador before informing <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            officials about the probable forthcoming disclosures.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> Subcommittee expects
                            Northrop’s report June 9; <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName>

                        <p>1. You should convey the following orally to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> and Prince <persName

                        <p>A. Undersecretary <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>
                            reported promptly to me the strong reactions of His Majesty and His
                            Highness to reports of Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                                >Schlesinger</persName>’s comments in a recent magazine interview
                            about the use of force to secure oil supplies.</p>
                        <p>B. This is a subject on which there has been much public discussion, and
                            I regret that it has again been raised in our country.</p>
                        <p>C. It is not our policy to threaten our Arab friends. Our policy is to
                            work cooperatively to strengthen our bilateral relations and to resolve
                            in that spirit any differences between us. We proceed from the
                            assumption that this is also the policy of our Arab friends and that
                            they are not contemplating actions against us.</p>
                        <p>D. I stated in Riyadh on March 19: Quote: I would like to state
                            categorically here that our relation with Saudi Arabia is based on
                            friendship and cooperation in which threats, military otherwise, play no
                            part, and we base our relationship on cooperation and not confrontation.
                            Unquote. That remains our policy.</p>
                        <p>E. I will seek an early opportunity to reaffirm this publicly.</p>
                        <p>2. Re Jidda 3633, you should tell <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> Israelis have not yet responded to our démarche to
                            them about overflights of Saudi territory. We will follow up vigorously
                            with them as soon as I return to Washington. Meanwhile, His Highness can
                            be assured that we have no information of any Israeli intention to
                            attack Saudi Arabia. If Israel were to contemplate an unprovoked attack
                            on Saudi Arabia, we would make clear to them that this would have the
                            most serious consequences. Our support for the Kingdom’s territorial
                            integrity is undiminished and as firm as ever.</p>

                            Conference in Ankara May 22: Quote: The challenge to diplomacy in the
                            Middle East is to achieve agreement among the parties that will assure
                            the territorial integrity, security, and right to national existence of
                            all the states of the region and that will be seen to take into account
                            the legitimate interests of all its peoples. Since the suspension of
                            negotiations in March, we have reviewed the various approaches of
                            assisting the parties to continue their progress. Our reassessment is
                            still under way. But we are convinced that the present stalemate must
                            not be allowed to continue. The United States has every intention of
                            remaining actively involved; we shall promote practical progress toward
                            a just and durable peace pursuant to Security Council Resolutions 242

                        <p>Mr. Willens explained that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1"
                                >Barger</persName> would be travelling to Saudi Arabia to help
                            Northrop on the issue of disclosing information contained in the Ernst
                            and Ernst audit report of the company’s operations in Saudi Arabia which
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> Subcommittee has and
                            which is likely to become public soon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> said he had volunteered
                            “reluctantly” for this job. He was going to Saudi Arabia as a
                            representative of the outside Board of Directors of Northrop. He would
                            not be reporting to Northrop’s management but only to its Board of
                            Directors. Since portions of the audit report made last year may become
                            public very soon, he felt the Saudis should be apprised of this as soon
                            as possible to let them ponder about what they might want to do. He also
                            felt the Saudis should be aware that Northrop’s outside directors had
                            been conducting their own investigation and they had a commitment to
                            make a report before the courts and Securities and Exchange Commission
                            by the end of July. But the result of this investigation was likely to
                            leak before then, in particular when the <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                                >Church</persName> Subcommittee begins to hear public testimony June
                            9.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the earlier meeting with the Acting Secretary, Mr. Willens
                            said Northrop had made two payments at the request of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>’s TRIAD Corporation: $250,000
                            for former <gloss target="#t_RSAF_1">RSAF</gloss> Commander General
                            Hashim and $200,000 for its present commander, General Zuhair. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> said Northrop’s files
                            were replete with remarks concerning these payments. Early when the
                            subject was mentioned, there were comments questioning whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> was telling the truth that
                            these payments had in fact been demanded by the Saudi officers. Later,
                            however, the tone of the memos appeared to change and the company seemed
                            convinced that these were genuine demands. The files indicated that the
                            first payment (to General Hashim) had been made but there was no similar
                            reference in the files about the second payment (to General Zuhair).
                            Despite these references, there was no hard evidence that either payment
                            had been received by the generals. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1"
                                >Barger</persName> assumed that when he described what the
                            investigation had uncovered and what was in the auditors report, he
                            would be closely questioned by the Saudis on this for proof of payment,
                            since under Sharia law, circumstantial evidence is not acceptable.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM_1">Feldman</persName>’s
                            question whether Northrop planned to pursue its request that its
                            testimony before the <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName>
                            Committee remain confidential to protect the company’s interests in
                            Saudi Arabia, Mr. Willens said Northrop was considering what to do. It
                            had already been advised informally by Mr. Levinson that this request
                            would be turned down. The company would ask that the names of the
                            generals not be disclosed but, in all likelihood, their names would come
                            out in public.</p>
                        <pb facs="0516" n="481" xml:id="pg_481"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> said there were several
                            other ancillary problems. First of all, he understood that Prince Sultan
                            had sent a letter to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                                >Ellsworth</persName> about Northrop commission payments to TRIAD
                            but he did not know what it said. He would like to have a copy. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> said he would look into
                            the question of Northrop’s receiving a copy of the letter but in the
                            meantime had no objection to his knowing its content. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> then read Prince Sultan’s letter
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> then asked what the
                            Department’s position should be. He planned to go first to Jidda to
                            consult with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> and
                            he hoped that the Ambassador would be able to accompany him on some
                            calls. He also hoped the Ambassador would arrange appointments for him
                            so that he would not have to go through <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName> to obtain them. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> remarked that indeed we wanted
                                <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> to meet first with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> to review the
                            present situation and get the benefit of his views. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> was already informed of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName>’s proposed visit and had
                            recommended that he first see Prince Sultan. While the Embassy might be
                            helpful in arranging an appointment for <persName corresp="#p_BT_1"
                                >Barger</persName> with Prince Sultan, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> did not believe it would be
                            appropriate for the Ambassador to accompany him on the call.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> said another issue was
                            that the company’s notes (not the auditors’ reports) contained numerous
                            references relative to Lockheed which explained why certain things were
                            done. There were references for example that General Hashim had removed
                            Northrop and GE representatives from meetings related to the original
                            F–5 sales contract discussions because Northrop had not paid anything as
                            Lockheed had done.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> said, there
                            was the question of what happens if the Saudi government decides that
                            TRIAD is no longer a bona fide agent. What happens to the various
                            American companies that use TRIAD as their agent. This becomes even more
                            complicated by the fact that Northrop is now in the midst of two major
                            negotiations, the last half of Peace Hawk IV which relate to add-ons for
                            the F–5Es and Fs (radars, ECM, laser guided bombs, etc), and Peace Hawk
                            V which involve the design and construction of the infrastructure
                            facilities for the <gloss target="#t_RSAF_1">RSAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM_1">Feldman</persName> said he believed
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> would want to
                            talk about the reach of the Northrop disclosures. Were only the two
                            generals mentioned? It was our understanding that at least one Saudi
                            prince (Prince Khalid bin Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman) had been mentioned.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> replied that both
                            generals names are mentioned as is Prince <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName>, but the latter is a recognized businessman.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> said that he and other
                            outside directors had discussed this matter with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> about six weeks ago.
                            Regarding the payment to General Hashim, <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName> had said this was a problem Northrop <pb
                                facs="0517" n="482" xml:id="pg_482"/> had gotten itself involved in
                            and he had helped the company to extricate itself from going any deeper.
                            With regard to the payment to General Zuhair, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> had not said anything. As for
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> had made the point that he is
                            a well known and recognized businessman.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName>’s
                            question whether there might be any other disclosures that will touch on
                            other Saudi personalities, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1"
                                >Barger</persName> did not think so, although Minister of Defense
                            Prince Sultan is often mentioned in the company memoranda but not in the
                            audit report. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> said
                            that there were basically four groups of documents: the auditors’
                            report, the oral examination made by Northrop’s group of outside
                            directors, the legal opinions prepared by the Northrop Legal Advisor
                            (Wilmer, Cutler and <persName corresp="#p_PTR_1">Pickering</persName>),
                            and company documents. He thought he had looked at all of the
                            documents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Willens said it was possible that Prince Sultan’s name might come to
                            the forefront because the company’s documents indicate the belief that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> had close
                            connections with Prince Sultan, though there are no allegations of any
                            payment by <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> to Sultan.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> had told <persName
                                corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> that of course he knew Sultan
                            and had been his close friend for many years but it was no more than
                            that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM_1">Feldman</persName> asked if we knew of
                            any business relationship between <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName> and Prince Sultan. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> said he had asked the same
                            question to <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> who had
                            denied any, and had said “Why should Sultan ask me anything, he has much
                            more money than I do.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName>
                            pointed out that the Northrop documents also refer to Sultan insisting
                            that sales go via the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> route rather
                            than commercial sale to avoid problems relating to agents’ fees.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM_1">Feldman</persName> noted that while there
                            was concern over the $450,000 payments, questions would inevitably be
                            raised whether any of the $20 million or so Northrop paid <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> under Peace Hawk IV had been
                            passed to others. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> said
                            that except for a small payment of between $5 and $10,000 to a few
                            individuals, there was nothing he had seen. Asked if the files contained
                            anything to justify that the services provided by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> were worth what Northrop had
                            paid, Mr. Willens said he was not aware this existed. If the question is
                            raised by the <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> Committee
                            whether payments to others had been made from the big commissions
                            received by <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>, Northrop
                            would say that it was unaware of any.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> asked if [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] might be implicated. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> said that [<hi
                                rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>] is mentioned and while
                            company documents contain some allegations regarding [<hi rend="italic"
                                >name not declassified</hi>], there is no indication of any
                            payments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> added that
                            once the story comes out, all kinds of inferences would be drawn.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> noted one other problem
                            which he would raise with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                                >Ellsworth</persName> when he meets him in the Pentagon on Friday.
                            This was <pb facs="0518" n="483" xml:id="pg_483"/> that when Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> sent his letter to
                            Prince Sultan in March about the agents’ fee for the next Peace Hawk
                            program, <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> claimed the
                            letter had been instigated by Northrop to reduce its commission to him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> could be expected
                            to pursue this line and say that Northrop’s disclosures before the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> Subcommittee were in
                            furtherance of this campaign.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> said he would try to
                            explain to the Saudis that Northrop has no way of evading requests to
                            testify before Congressional committees or refusing to respond to
                            subpoenas. Recalling his experience with <gloss target="#t_ARAMCO_1"
                                >ARAMCO</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName>
                            remarked that the Saudis still believe US corporations have a great deal
                            of power and influence in the US and do not have to make disclosures
                            unless they have some special motive for doing so. The company was
                            therefore concerned that Saudi reaction would be very strong and the
                            company could lose its position in the Kingdom. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> was also concerned that events
                            could move very quickly once the Saudis were aware that there would be
                            public disclosures. He hoped that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1"
                                >Akins</persName> could support the point that under US law Northrop
                            has to respond and is being forced by legal action to make these
                            disclosures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SS_1">Sober</persName> said he would welcome
                            hearing from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> after he
                            meets with <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> officials. We would
                            inform Embassy Jidda regarding his travel plans. While we would not want
                            to instruct the Ambassador to go along on any meetings, we were
                            sympathetic with his problem of needing Embassy help to get appointments
                            with Saudi officials to avoid going through <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName>. While the US obviously had a considerable
                            stake in Northrop’s continued business operations in Saudi Arabia, it
                            seemed clear that this essentially was a problem to be dealt with by the
                            company with the Saudi Government and <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName>, at least in the first instance. The US
                            Government could not be seen as intervening in any action that could
                            come before the courts. If the Saudis raise questions to us about
                            Northrop’s need to make disclosures, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> will of course respond in an appropriate way.</p>

                        <p>1. For Cairo: We agree that you should not ask to meet with Sultan on
                            this subject.</p>
                        <p>2. For Jidda: Believe it would be useful for you to meet with Sultan and
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>, in your discretion,
                            to attempt to sooth Saudi irritation and to contain damage to our
                            relations. You may emphasize that disclosures are not the fault of
                            Northrop or <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and are not aimed at
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> but are the result of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> law and legal procedures. We would
                            also appreciate your view on whether transmittal of <persName
                                corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName> letter of May 23 will elicit
                            sharp Saudi reaction, and if so, how matter can be best managed to
                            minimize any Saudi feeling that it is being pressured or embarrassed by
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. We agree you should not become
                            involved in Northrop’s negotiations with Sultan relating to the status
                            of Northrop’s agreement with Triad. Therefore, believe you should not
                            advise <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> on the substance of
                            the letter he proposes Sultan to send to <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"

                        <p>133649. Subject: Northrop’s “Commission” Problems. Ref: Jidda 4028.</p>
                        <p>1. After careful review of issues, Department requests Ambassador provide
                            May 23 letter to Prince Sultan. In doing so, you should state regret
                            over troubling Sultan with another letter but explain that for legal
                            reasons, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> needs a written response
                            from Sultan specifically addressing Commission in Peace Hawk IV
                            program.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>: Should Sultan’s response
                            disapprove all or part of Commission, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> would have basis for action and Northrop, according to
                            its counsel, would have legal argument in effort to avoid liability for
                            payment of all or part of balance of Commission to Triad. Northrop has
                            already paid $6 million. Sultan’s response, however, will not eliminate
                            likely Northrop-Triad legal dispute. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1"
                                >FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Because Sultan’s May 17 letter is unclear with regard to retroactivity
                            intended for policy statements regarding Commission, it is not useful
                            with respect to programs prior to Peace Hawk V program. Accordingly,
                            specific letter regarding Peace Hawk IV program is essential.</p>
                        <p>4. We do not wish you to request Prince Sultan’s permission at this time
                            to release text of May 17 letter as statement of <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> policy in all cases. We believe <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> should issue clear policy statement
                            prohibiting agent fees unless they are reasonable, justifiable and
                            clearly identified in contract. However, we would prefer to transmit to
                            you our views on this matter in greater detail for you to discuss with
                            Sultan at a later date.</p>

                        <p>Summary: On June 9 Ambassador met with Prince Sultan, Saudi Minister of
                            Defense, to discuss problems of Northrop Corporation and agents’ fees
                            with Saudi Arabia. He said congressional investigations of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military sales had caused <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> to appear in a predominantly favorable
                            light. Northrop books showed payments of $450,000 to Adnan Khoshoggi,
                            but no proof this money actually paid (as has been alleged) to Saudi
                            officials. Re agents’ fees, Ambassador noted that issue of fees for
                            Peace Hawk V clarified by Prince’s letter of May 17; issue remained of
                            fees under Peace Hawk IV, and unless this resolved satisfactorily
                            Northrop Corporation could be liable to expensive litigation. Sultan
                            replied that he had not known of Commissions in connection with <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> sales prior to receiving <persName
                                corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> letter; he would not approve

                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> case. He urged a statement be issued
                                <gloss target="#t_ASAP_1">ASAP</gloss> by <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> affirming that neither it nor <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"

                        <p>1. On June 9 Ambassador called upon <gloss target="#t_MODA_1"
                                >MODA</gloss> Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz to discuss problems of
                            Northrop Corporation, and payment of agents’ fees in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador began by reviewing for Prince background to current
                            investigations and hearings in the Senate and the House. He noted that
                            revelations and reports of impropriety involved several <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> firms in various countries, and
                            that—according to Senator <persName corresp="#p_PC_1"
                            >Percy</persName>—Saudi Arabia record of dealings with <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> companies was creditable. Ambassador
                            said that with regard to Saudi Arabia, Northrop records indicated a
                            payment to Adnan Khoshoggi of $450,000 ostensibly for benefit of two <pb
                                facs="0523" n="488" xml:id="pg_488"/> Saudi generals. Ambassador
                            emphasized that payment of these monies to Khoshoggi the only sure fact:
                            We had no indication any payments made to Saudi officials or that such
                            officials had behaved improperly.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambassador said Prince’s reply of May 17 to Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>’s letter of March 7
                            about Peace Hawk V program was clear. He noted though that <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> lawyers believed some ambiguity still
                            existed regarding agents’ fees for the Peace Hawk IV program. For this
                            reason he wished to present Sultan with a letter from General <persName
                                corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName> which we hoped would lead to the
                            clarification of this latter point. Unless such clarification could be
                            obtained, Ambassador explained, Northrop could be liable to heavy
                            financial losses via lawsuits. (The letter was read in Arabic to the
                            Prince.)</p>
                        <p>4. The Ambassador urged that in dealing with these difficult and
                            sensitive matters, Sultan consider that the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> procedure was still probably the most desirable from
                            the standpoint of the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s interests.
                            There would be no more confidentiality accorded to <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s arms purchases if it went the
                            contractor-to-government route; commissions would be unavoidable and
                            would certainly be much larger. He hoped that Sultan would deal with
                            this problem with the same coolness and judgment he had showed at other
                            times when our relations were under strain. He urged that no action be
                            taken that might give heart to those hostile to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Saudi friendship, or harm a military supply
                            relationship that has been of value to both sides for many years.</p>
                        <p>5. Sultan thanked the Ambassador for his thoughtful presentation, and
                            asked if he might call upon the expert advice of his legal advisor, Dr.
                            Ghezi Nuseibeh. In Nuseibeh’s presence Sultan said the issue of agents’
                            fees and commissions would have to be dealt with in a way that took into
                            consideration the joint interests of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> and Saudi Arabia. The problem of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> firms abroad would not as a rule
                            concern him—but with regard to any suspicion or hint of wrong-doing by
                            such a firm in Saudi Arabia, he wanted full and prompt information. He
                            wanted also the fullest information we had about anything that might
                            indicate the possibility of misconduct by officials of the Ministry of
                            Defense. He recalled that three years before he had forced an Oerlikon
                            agent to leave the country, and to repay $400,000 in bribes paid to
                            Ministry officers. The officers had been cashiered and disgraced.</p>
                        <p>6. Sultan also believed it important—in the present “highly-charged
                            atmosphere”—that the integrity of the negotiating principals not be
                            impugned. He had never known of agents’ fees in regard to <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> sales until he received Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>’s letter and he was both
                            surprised and hurt by the manner in which it was delivered. It would
                            have been much more appropriate for it to have been sent confidentially
                            through the Ambassador. In any case, the information on agents’ fees did
                            not appear in any document in his files. In commercial
                                (government-to-<pb facs="0524" n="489" xml:id="pg_489"/>contractor)
                            sales, agents’ fees could be left to a company and its agent, as a
                            matter apart from the company’s contract with the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>. But with regard to <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> sales, he had to insist that
                            absolutely no agents’ payments could be made for either Peace Hawk IV
                            (General <persName corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName>’s letter).</p>
                        <p>7. On the general question of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> sales,
                            Sultan recalled he had spoken critically of them to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BT_1">Barger</persName> (Cairo’s 6516). He believed,
                            however, that the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> route remained
                            probably the best for large military sales. He reminded the Ambassador
                            he had expressed preference to the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            for <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> be the Raytheon improved Hawk
                            system, the Lockheed ground environment system, and Bendix-Syanco’s role
                            in <gloss target="#t_SAMP_1">SAMP</gloss>. In these cases the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s reply had not been to encourage the
                            government-to-government route. Were he to learn that such a commission
                            had in fact been paid, he would terminate the entire Peace Hawk program.
                            He promised a written reply to General <persName corresp="#p_FHM_1"
                                >Fish</persName>’s letter by June 10.</p>
                        <p>8. Sultan then said he thought the best way for the air to be cleared
                            would be if the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would make an
                            announcement about the proper conduct of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Saudi <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> cases. His
                            lawyer suggested the following statement: Quote We have looked into the
                            question of our foreign military sales (<gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss>) programs to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There is no
                            indication whatever that either the United States Government or the
                            Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has engaged in any improper conduct. The Saudi
                            Government moreover has informed the United States Government that it
                            did not know of any agents’ fees in the past in connection with <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> sales, nor will it permit any such
                            payments in the future. End quote.</p>
                        <p>Comment: Sultan’s first draft provided for a final statement which read:
                            Quote . . . did not know of any agents’ fees in the past in connection
                            with <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> sales, would not have approved
                            them, and would not permit any such payments in the future. End quote.
                            The intermediate clause the Ambassador pointed out could complicate
                            matters by evoking <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> issues going
                            back many years. He suggested the clause be omitted and that the future
                            handling of such cases be allowed to stand clearly as of now. Sultan
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>9. In closing, the Ambassador said congressional investigations by
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> and Representative
                            Hamilton would probably also deal with government-to-contractor deals in
                            various parts of the world. Sultan asked for early information on
                            anything that might pertain to Saudi Arabia; he would get to the bottom
                            of all rumors and accusations.</p>
                        <p>10. Action requested</p>
                        <p>A) The Department’s views and concurrence <gloss target="#t_ASAP_1"

                        <p>138345. Subject: Northrop Agent’s Fees. Ref: State 137147.</p>
                        <p>1. In your meeting with Sultan, request you state that <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is preparing to issue policy statement
                            to effect that no commission will be permitted for sales under FMSA
                            unless it is in a reasonable amount for services rendered by a bona fide
                            commercial agent and has been specifically disclosed to and approved by
                            the buyer-government in advance.</p>
                        <p>2. We do not believe it would be productive at this sensitive time for
                            you to try to dissuade Sultan from any public statement or publication
                            of documents he might feel necessary.</p>
                        <p>3. At your discretion, however, you may point out the following:</p>
                        <p>A. Because of possibility of reviving publicity on Northrop (addressed in
                                <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>) we do not desire to
                            issue any joint statement with Saudis at this time.</p>
                        <p>B. As noted <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, publication of
                            May 17 letter would provide basis for questions regarding Sultan’s
                            assertion he stated Saudi policy to you and <gloss target="#t_USMTM_1"
                                >USMTM</gloss> Chief as soon as he received <persName

                        <p>C. Timeliness of any <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> statement
                            addressing only Northrop problem would seem questionable given
                            possibility that <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName>
                            Subcommittee or other body may turn up new allegations regarding actions
                            by other US companies in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>D. Blanket <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> prohibition of all agents
                            fees would pose problem if, as appears likely, services by local agents
                            such as travel arrangements, translations services, appointments, visas,
                            are essential to effective operations by <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> contractors in Saudi Arabia. New <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy para 1 would permit <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> to review and approve or disapprove
                            fees proposed for such services in future <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> contracts.</p>
                        <p>4. At this time, we do not believe you should discuss legal or financial
                            consequences for Northrop or its ongoing programs in Saudi Arabia of
                            Sultan’s prohibition of agents fees in Phase IV. This would <pb

                            3197.</p>
                        <p>Summary: As Saudis move toward a policy on Somalia, they again request
                            definition of our intentions and objectives re Soviet base facilities in
                            Berbera, and of our willingness to replace <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> as source of military supply for Somalia. <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> is inclined to press Somalis not to
                            allow base ever to be activated; they believe that if it were activated,
                            Soviets would simply dig in despite pressure and criticism, and raise
                            hue and cry about Western rights and facilities elsewhere in the region.
                            Intensity and immediacy of Saudi pressures on Somalis, however, may
                            slacken because of linkage established by <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> briefings between Soviet presence and US interest in
                            expanding our facility in Diego Garcia. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. We have received another request from the Saudis for a definition of
                            our intentions and objectives with respect to the Soviet facilities at
                            Berbera, Somalia.</p>
                        <p>2. Calling attention to their surprise and puzzlement over unexpected
                            publication of aerial reconnaissance photography which they had been

                                xml:id="pg_493"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> any further action of his own
                            government on this situation. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> has
                            definitely decided to concentrate on a strategy of pressuring the Somali
                            regime not to allow the Soviet base ever to be activated—as opposed to
                            waiting for missiles to arrive and then hoping to force the Soviet Union
                            to make an embarrassing and expensive withdrawal under a spotlight of
                            publicity.</p>
                        <p>3. Prince <persName corresp="#p_TBAS_1">Turki</persName>’s reasoning was
                            concise: The Saudis estimate that the Somalis were honestly ignorant of
                            the nature of the Soviet installation in the past, and may still be
                            unconvinced; the Soviets undoubtedly realized from the beginning that
                            their base would be exposed sooner or later, and must have already
                            discounted the political liability in consideration of greater long-term
                            military advantages; the Soviets must, therefore, be expected to “dig
                            in” and resist all efforts to force them to abandon the Berbera
                            facility; if there is any chance to overcome Soviet determination to
                            remain, however, it will be before the base is fully activated and while
                            there is yet some plausibility to the claim that the real purposes of
                            the installation were misrepresented by “Imperialist propaganda.”</p>
                        <p>4. Prince <persName corresp="#p_TBAS_1">Turki</persName> “unofficially”
                            voiced his government’s concern that if the Berbera base were activated,
                            Soviet reaction to protests from regional governments would take the
                            form of an international hue and cry over <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> military rights and facilities at Bahrain, Masirah and
                            Diego Garcia. This would put irresistible pressure on the Saudis to
                            support a policy of keeping the entire Indian Ocean, Red Sea and Persian
                            Gulf areas free of all foreign bases, a policy which they would, under
                            present circumstances, consider a net disadvantage to themselves and to
                            the free world generally. If the Soviet reaction succeeded in posing
                            American “withdrawal” from those “foreign bases” as a reasonable quid
                            pro quo for the closure of the Berbera facility, the Saudis fear that
                            the United States would be inclined to reach a stand-off accommodation
                            with the Soviet Union in favor of preserving the unchallenged right of
                            both great powers to dispose their strategic influence in the Indian
                            Ocean region. “In that event,” said <persName corresp="#p_TBFAS_1"
                                >Turki</persName>, “Saudi Arabia would be the ultimate loser. The
                            existence of a Soviet air/communications/missile base at Berbera is a
                            direct and immediate threat to our security. Tolerance of its existence
                            would also significantly undercut our efforts to keep the region free of
                            Communist military influence, and would most particularly weaken the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> Government’s resistance to
                            Soviet demands for naval base rights at Aden.”</p>
                        <p>5. The pace and energy of further Saudi efforts to pressure the Somali
                            regime can be expected to slacken measurably as a result of the
                            publicity given this subject by the Defense Department in the context of
                            justifying our own proposed naval facilities in the Indian Ocean. The
                            favorable impact of our “exclusive” and “Top Secret” briefings has <pb
                                facs="0529" n="494" xml:id="pg_494"/> likewise been severely
                            dissipated, and replaced by growing suspicion in Saudi minds that they
                            were being “used.”</p>
                        <p>6. Efforts to generate renewed Saudi activity vis-à-vis Somalia must
                            await a response to Prince Saud’s request (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1"
                                >reftel</gloss>) that they be permitted to assure Somalia of the
                            willingness of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to replace the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as a source of military
                            supply should the expulsion of the Soviets from Berbera result in

                            concern is equipment and they constantly compare their inventory with

                            that part of the problem is unwillingness of the <gloss

                        <p>SUMMARY: In meeting with <gloss target="#t_MinDef_1">MinDef</gloss>
                            Prince Sultan July 14 Ambassador pointed out that under terms of
                            Kashoggi’s contract with Northrop Corporation, company could be forced
                            to pay up to one hundred million in agent’s fees. This could either sink
                            Northrop, or force it to withdraw from all Saudi operations—in either
                            case, it would seriously harm the development of the Saudi air force.
                            Sultan agreed to get in touch with Kashoggi to advise him not to
                            pressure Northrop nor to demand his legal fees from it. Sultan was
                            certain Northrop could go ahead and sign Peace Hawk III extension with
                            no concern about any legal action Kashoggi might take at not receiving
                            agent’s fee. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. During meeting with <gloss target="#t_MinDef_1">MinDef</gloss> Prince
                            Sultan July 14, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName>
                            said the main purpose for his brief return to the Kingdom was to raise
                            with Prince the important and delicate matter of Northrop’s operations
                            in Saudi Arabia. He said first that as a result of Prince Sultan’s
                            disapproval of agent’s fees in connection with foreign military sales,
                            the Defense Department had decided—with regard to all its <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> programs about the world—to prohibit
                            agent’s fees unless (a) they were specifically identified and (b) a
                            clear and proper identification was made of the agent’s services to
                            justify any commission fee. The Prince listened with approval, and asked
                            if this meant that there would henceforth be no room in <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> contracts for the straight
                            middleman—the influence peddler—the Ambassador said that was so.</p>
                        <p>2. The Ambassador then said to Sultan that with regard to Northrop’s
                            activities in Saudi Arabia, it appeared clear from Sultan’s statement no
                            agent’s fees or commissions could be paid for any of the company’s
                            projects in Saudi Arabia. Prince Sultan affirmed this was exactly the
                            case. If a company were to do so, he said, it would quickly find itself
                            out of Saudi Arabia. The Ambassador then explained to <pb facs="0536"
                                n="501" xml:id="pg_501"/> Sultan that although Northrop could not
                            charge for agent’s fees for several large projects now underway or in
                            negotiation in Saudi Arabia, Adnan Kashoggi enjoyed a binding contract
                            with Northrop that entitled him to a 5% commission on all sales of
                            Northrop products or services to Saudi Arabia—even if such commissions
                            are not included in the costs of such sales that are being paid by the
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>. If Northrop continues with its
                            projects in Saudi Arabia, therefore, it could be held liable to pay a
                            total in agent’s fees of a sum that could approach 100 million dollars.
                            The total profits of Northrop last year were only about a quarter of
                            this; and if Kashoggi pressed his advantage under American law, it could
                            result either in Northrop’s collapse, or in its withdrawal from all
                            Saudi projects. Either way, the Ministry’s of Defense highly successful
                            air force development would be seriously disrupted.</p>
                        <p>3. The Ambassador said that lawyers from the Department of State and the
                            Department of Defense had considered the situation very carefully, and
                            had only one possible remedy to suggest: that the Saudi Government, and
                            His Royal Highness Prince Sultan should appeal to Kashoggi’s sense of
                            patriotism and public service, and ask that he annul the portions of his
                            contract with Northrop that provided for payment of a fixed fee for all
                            sales to Saudi Arabia or at least for payment of all sales dealing with
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> cases.</p>
                        <p>4. Sultan asked if our lawyers believed it would be proper for him to
                            speak up on such a matter involving a Saudi citizen and an American
                            corporation? When the Ambassador replied that they did, Sultan said
                            firmly that nothing could be allowed to impede rapid, smooth and
                            successful development of the Royal Saudi Air Force. Since Kashoggi was
                            not a government official but a private Saudi citizen, Sultan would
                            instruct him by way of a “personal suggestion” that he waive his rights
                            to agent’s fees, and under no circumstances press the company for them.
                            The Ambassador asked if on the basis of the Prince’s assurance it would
                            be safe to tell the Northrop Corporation that it could proceed to sign
                            the extension of Peace Hawk III without having to fear any adverse
                            financial repercussions because of its contract with Kashoggi. Sultan
                            said there would be no <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> no trouble
                            from Kashoggi and that the company could proceed with the required
                            extension.</p>
                        <p>5. In closing, Sultan mentioned that he had recently received two letters
                            from Northrop board chairman Tom Jones asking if Sultan’s prohibition
                            did in fact apply to payment of all agent’s fees of any sort. Sultan’s
                            reply was that it most certainly did apply to all agent’s fees and he
                            thought the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government should be
                            appreciative to him for his stand. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> said the prohibition of agent’s
                            fees might significantly lower the cost of major projects to the
                            Ministry of Defense and Aviation. Sultan said he very much hoped this
                            would be so.</p>

                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated Saudi Arabia.]</p>
                        <p>MR. ATHERTON: We have been negotiating for some months the agreement to
                            regularize the status of the Mid-East forces in Bahrain. You remember
                            during the ‘73 war they invoked the termination clause. There were three
                            issues. Two of them have been resolved. The third issue is one we are
                            going to have to reach a decision on quickly. They want to specify a
                            date for the final termination of the presence of the Mid-East forces in
                            Bahrain, as of mid-1977. And we have up to now managed to keep that from
                            becoming part of the agreement and negotiation itself. Where it now
                            stands is that they plan simply to send us a unilateral notice, saying
                            that this is their intention. We have got a memorandum coming to you
                            which examines several options that we might look at other than just
                            acquiescing. I don’t think there is any chance of turning them around on
                            this short of getting the Shah and King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName> publicly to say that they welcome—and neither one
                            of them I think is willing to do this. The Bahrainians feel they are
                            vulnerable—</p>
                        <pb facs="0538" n="503" xml:id="pg_503"/>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Why do we need them if we get Diego Garcia?</p>
                        <p>MR. ATHERTON: I don’t think we do. My recommendation in this memo is
                            going to be we make a joint statement by them and us that we have
                            amicably agreed—</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Why do we have to do that? Why not let them make a
                            unilateral statement?</p>
                        <p>MR. ATHERTON: I think we gain something from doing it.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: What do we gain?</p>
                        <p>MR. ATHERTON: I think we gain some political credit.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: With whom?</p>
                        <p>MR. ATHERTON: With the Arabs in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: With what Arabs?</p>
                        <p>MR. ATHERTON: I think basically with all of the Emirates, with the
                            Saudis. The alternative is simply—</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: I have never known an Arab whom you gain anything
                            with from withdrawing.</p>
                        <p>MR. ATHERTON: We are going to be withdrawing anyway. The other way it
                            looks as though we have been kicked out.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: But we are also getting it extended. Anybody knowing
                            an Arab statement of intention knows that between now and 1977 that may
                            mean we will go out in 1977 or in 2063. A unilateral declaration by the
                            Bahrain government doesn’t mean anything. I don’t see what we gain by
                            agreeing to it.</p>
                        <p>MR. ATHERTON: Well, we have got the memo which looks at this in more
                            detail. I think it is worth looking at as one of the options.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: I am very pre-disposed against announcing now that
                            we are going to get out in 1977. I am not fighting for staying in there.
                            Once we have Diego Garcia, we can announce in ’77. I see absolutely
                            nothing we gain by announcing it today. Let them make a unilateral
                            statement that they won’t renew it in ’77.</p>
                        <p>Anything else?</p>
                        <p>Carl?</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: We have several upcoming problems with these high commissions
                            that are being paid on military sales in the Persian Gulf area. And as
                            of the moment, Northrop’s contract with Kashoggi is in trouble.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: With whom?</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: A chap named Kashoggi, who owns the Triad Financial Corporation,
                            who is the commission agent or the sales agent for Lockheed, Raytheon,
                            Northrop and several others. His fees run from 4 to 17 percent on sales
                            to the Saudi Arabian government. Prince Sultan has refused to permit
                            further fees on the Peace Hawk program. Unfortunately, the next phase of
                            the program is about a billion dollars. And Mr. Kashoggi has refused to
                            release Northrop from their contractual obligation to pay four percent
                            on that the moment the contract is signed with the Saudi Arabian
                            government. So we are now at an impasse.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: What is that program?</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: That is the whole program of their air force, building an air
                            force.</p>
                        <p>We also have a little disagreement with the Department of Defense as to
                            our position on payment of fees. I have taken the position that fees
                            should not be paid to these intermediaries unless disclosed to and
                            approved by the paying government—it is added on to the price and it is
                            paid by the purchasing government. We are in a little disagreement with
                            the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> on that point at the
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: What do they want to do?</p>
                        <pb facs="0539" n="504" xml:id="pg_504"/>
                        <p>MR. MAW: They are on the spot a little bit, because they have approved a
                            good many of these fees. I can find nothing good that comes out of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Except that that is the way business is done in the
                            Middle East. While Protestantism is a great religion, it is not the one
                            in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>MR. HABIB: And the Far East, too.</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: In military sales, we go out and sell a program to a country,
                            and then we cut somebody else in on it. I think we have some
                            responsibility to make sure that the purchasing government at least
                            knows what we are doing and what they are paying for. And when it was
                            disclosed to Sultan that—</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: He was outraged, right—that he wasn’t getting the
                            four percent. Never had heard of a thing like this.</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: He wasn’t getting any of this particular one.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: I can see that would create bad feelings.</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: Now, the disclosures that are going to come in Lockheed will
                            show much more—much greater money movement and even to higher officials
                            in the Saudi Arabian government. And hopefully those payments will not
                            be disclosed. But I’m afraid they will be disclosed. And we are going to
                            be in the middle, of course, for having permitted the payments without
                            disclosure to the Saudi Government.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: But what is our problem?</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: Our problem now is to keep the program moving while litigation
                            is going to take place between Northrop and Kashoggi. We are just
                            referring it back to the Saudi government.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: The Lockheed are commercial contracts primarily, so it
                            doesn’t go through the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: The C–130s, we stepped out of it. That is why they are higher
                            fees. And we have to do something about our whole licensing of those. We
                            grant the licenses here in the State Department with no disclosure about
                            payments. These fees have been used for—</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: But is anyone thinking of the impact of all of this
                            on Saudi Arabia, where they have been doing it like this for 2,000
                            years?</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: They want to change now.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: They don’t want to change. They are being forced to
                            change by us, and they are going to go to other suppliers. Don’t tell me
                            the Saudis want to change.</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: The Shah issued an order a year ago no more commissions in Iran.
                            And that has been pretty well enforced.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: My point is are we going around on a Protestant
                            missionary exercise or are we—I just want to be sure we <pb facs="0540"
                                n="505" xml:id="pg_505"/> maintain our influence in Saudi Arabia. I
                            am not in favor of paying commissions.</p>
                        <p>MR. EAGLEBURGER: We are sending Billy Graham there next week.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: I just want to make sure we are not harassing these
                            people for doing something which—</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: The disclosure is coming out of the Hill.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: First it comes out of the <gloss target="#t_SEC_1"
                                >SEC</gloss> and then <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName>
                            picks it up and exposes it all.</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: And this Northrop report is not very happy reading for Saudi
                            Arabia.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: Lockheed is going to be worse.</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: Much worse—payments to generals, the chief of the Air Force got
                            extra money.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Is anybody here who knows Saudi Arabia is
                            surprised?</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: No.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: They regularly add five percent to their
                            contracts.</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: You wouldn’t mind if they were normal sales and just a few
                            million dollars. But when they run into the hundreds of millions of
                            dollars, they get a little—</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: I am not saying that I like it. I am just wondering
                            whether we are not antagonizing the whole royal family there.</p>
                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: We are for sure. This is going to be our biggest problem.
                            In Iran, too, we are going to be antagonizing the Shah.</p>

                        <p>MR. INGERSOLL: And the Shah’s relatives are involved.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: Do we have to pursue this to the bitter end?</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: We are going to be called on to say what are we doing about
                            these payments, are we supporting the briberies or aren’t we.</p>
                        <p>MR. HABIB: It applies to other straight-out aid programs, too. The
                                <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> committee is on to
                            commission payments on aid programs to the Far East.</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: They are going to legislate on this. I hope we can avoid
                            legislation. We don’t want a criminal offense of paying commissions,
                            because some of these commissions are perfectly legitimate.</p>

                        <p>MR. HABIB: Some of them are contrary to law, however, on some of the aid
                            programs to Asia.</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: That is right.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: What is the issue now?</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: Well, the issue now is to let you know that this problem does
                            exist between Sultan and Kashoggi.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: I just hope that somebody keeps in mind that the
                            royal family in Saudi Arabia controls our oil supply, and that
                            moderation in the Middle East depends importantly on what the Saudis do.
                            I just hope that that is being kept in mind.</p>
                        <p>MR. MAW: Very much.</p>

                        <p>1. Since <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> (A), Northrop met

                            his lawyers in Los Angeles on August 4 to discuss agent fees problem. At
                            that meeting, <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> stated

                            program.</p>
                        <p>2. Triad lawyers (Macleod, Fuller, Muir, and Godwin) subsequently
                            presented Northrop with a letter dated August 6 (copy being pouched to
                            Embassy) which inter alia states that (a) Triad has reviewed Northrop’s
                            two letters setting forth correspondence on the agency issue and a
                            proposed termination agreement; (b) Triad regrets existence of
                            circumstances prompting Northrop to propose termination of agreement;
                            (c) Triad has invested substantial amounts of time, effort, and capital
                            with Northrop to initiate and attain successful Peace Hawk program; (d)
                            Triad therefore intends to assure that any modification of its
                            contractual rights take into account its performance; (e) proposed
                            termination agreement and release are not necessary or appropriate under
                            alleged policies of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> or <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>; (f) despite Northrop allegations that
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> policies with regard to Peace
                            Hawk program require termination of agreement, Triad has not found
                            confirmation of that position within rules and regulations of <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>, rather believes that <gloss

                                >SAG</gloss> to interfere with legitimate commercial relationships;
                            (g) Triad is therefore proceeding as rapidly as possible to clarify in
                            its own mind <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s position and is
                            seeking ascertain precise policies and desires of <gloss

                            between Triad and Northrop as well as previously recognized distinction

                            marketing organization representatives; and (h) for all these reasons
                            Triad intends to pursue its full legal rights and remedies under present
                            agency agreement and it does not recognize or accept any right on part
                            of Northrop to terminate agreement.</p>
                        <p>3. Northrop legal counsel points out that Triad letter was written after
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>’s meeting with
                            Prince Sultan and possibly other Saudi officials. However, it

                            gone back to Saudi Arabia to plead his case where he will endeavor
                            present it before Saudi Council of Ministers (ref B) arguing that Prince
                            Sultan exceeded his authority in seeking to compel Triad to terminate
                            its agency agreement with Northrop.</p>
                        <p>4. In light problem posed for Northrop if agency fee question not settled
                            before August 16 when Phase III extension begins, Chargé should deliver

                        <p>5. Begin text: Your Royal Highness: I hope you will excuse me for not
                            presenting this message in person but family reasons require me to
                            remain in the United States a few weeks longer. My daughter has just
                            successfully undergone a difficult operation. Thanks be to God, she is
                            now convalescing very nicely but I want to be with her when she returns
                            to Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <pb facs="0543" n="508" xml:id="pg_508"/>
                        <p>You will recall our meeting of July 14 when I explained that one of the
                            purposes of my brief return to the Kingdom was to raise with you the
                            important and delicate matter of Northrop Corporation’s operations in
                            Saudi Arabia. Your Royal Highness affirmed to me that no agent’s fees or
                            commissions could be paid for any of Northrop’s or for any other foreign
                            military sales to your Ministry and if Northrop were to do so, it would
                            quickly find itself out of Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>The US Department of Defense has issued instructions specifically
                            prohibiting any agent fees for foreign military sales to the Saudi
                            Ministry of Defense and Aviation unless specifically identified and
                            approved in writing. This prohibition applies to the Peace Hawk III
                            extension which the Saudi Government has just approved. This will of
                            course amount to a very large saving for the Saudi Government.</p>
                        <p>It will, of course, be of interest to Your Royal Highness that similar
                            requests have been received and implemented by the Department of Defense
                            for Iran and other countries. Since our conversation, Northrop has
                            sought to terminate its agency agreement with Triad before commencing
                            further Peace Hawk projects. Otherwise, as I told Your Royal Highness,
                            its lawyers have concluded that Northrop could be held liable to an
                            agent’s fee in excess of the corporation’s anticipated worldwide
                            profits.</p>
                        <p>I have just learned that Triad has refused to terminate its agency
                            agreement with Northrop. In fact, I am told Triad is appealing its case
                            to the Saudi Council of Ministers. Northrop therefore finds itself in a
                            most difficult position in view of the fact that the next phase of the
                            Peace Hawk program is to begin on August 16. Northrop’s lawyers have
                            informed us that unless the corporation is able to terminate its agency
                            agreement promptly (or be reimbursed for Triad fees), Northrop will have
                            to withdraw from Peace Hawk projects since Triad has indicated by letter
                            to Northrop that it intends to pursue its full legal rights and remedies
                            and does not recognize or accept any right on the part of Northrop to
                            terminate its agreement nor, it alleges, does it find any confirmation
                            inside the Saudi Government of Your Royal Highness’ explicitly stated
                            prohibition.</p>
                        <p>I regret that I am unable to discuss this matter with you personally at
                            this time but wished to inform you of these recent developments as soon
                            as possible so that you might take appropriate timely action to resolve
                            the current problem and ensure smooth continuation of the Peace Hawk
                            program. As I have noted, Northrop has concluded that either the agency
                            fees must be paid on demand by Triad or Triad’s present agency
                            arrangement with Northrop as it relates to foreign military sales must
                            be terminated if Northrop is to continue in the Peace Hawk program. I am
                            looking forward to seeing you at the end of <pb facs="0544" n="509"

                        <p>Summary: (A) Chargé had Ambassador’s letter on Northrop’s fees delivered
                            to Prince Sultan August 9, with intention to follow-up with Sultan on
                            August 10 after his meeting with Senator Scott in Ta’if. On morning of
                            10th, however Sultan informed Senator he could not leave Riyadh. (B) On
                            same day General <persName corresp="#p_AJH_1">Ahmann</persName>
                            presented Sultan with amendment to Peace Hawk Phase III <gloss
                                target="#t_LOA_1">LOA</gloss>. Sultan received him with four of most
                            senior <gloss target="#t_SAAF_1">SAAF</gloss> Officers also present and
                            immediately began to discuss Ambassador’s letter. Sultan did turn-around
                            from his meeting of July 14 with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1"
                                >Akins</persName>: He said there was no way he could put pressure on
                            Triad nor interfere in the business relationships between it and
                            Northrop. He blamed <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> for not having
                            told him earlier about agents’ fees, and repeated that in future no fees
                            could be paid for Peace Hawk contract. Sultan said <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was obliged, however, to see that
                            Peace Hawk program went on anyway either by providing blue suiters or
                            another contractor. If this couldn’t be done he would buy planes
                            elsewhere “perhaps even Russia or China.” (A statement we think made for
                            effect—we would be on British-French Jaguar as alternate to F–5). (C)
                            Embassy believes Sultan’s position is firm. He wants Peace Hawk program
                            to succeed, but what is now probably uppermost in his mind is how to
                            assure his continued authority at top <pb facs="0545" n="510"
                                xml:id="pg_510"/> levels of <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>. To
                            this end he is probably ready to blame any setback to Peace Hawk on
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> that let him down, and Zionist
                            elements—who working against Saudi Arabia as they are against Jordan and
                            Turkey. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi relations on a broad
                            front would suffer if this were to take place. (D) Action recommended:
                            (a) We do not think an appeal to <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> to pressure Kashoggi would work or be welcomed by
                            him; (b) Could Northrop-Triad lawyers work out some compromise solution?
                            It would be to financial interests of each to do so; (c) Could <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> with its own political/defense
                            interests in Saudi Arabia help pressure Kashoggi’s company to reach some
                            kind of workable agreement with Northrop? End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. Upon receipt of Ambassador’s letter (ref C) Saturday August 9, Chargé
                            telephoned Prince Sultan’s Office Director Col. Tassan in Ta’if, told
                            him of letter, and said he would like to present it and obtain Prince’s
                            reactions as soon as possible. Chargé suggested this might take place
                            after Senator Scott of the Armed Services Committee met with Prince on
                            August 10. Office Director said Prince was in Riyadh, but he expected
                            him in Ta’if next morning for Senator Scott’s meeting. To facilitate
                            Prince’s consideration of issue, Chargé had Ambassador’s letter
                            delivered to Sultan’s office in Ta’if during Saudi business hours August
                            9 by <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> messenger. Tassan in turn
                            delivered Ambassador’s letter to Sultan in Riyadh same day so that
                            Sultan could give it advance study.</p>
                        <p>2. The next morning (August 10) Royal Diwan again confirmed to Embassy
                            Sultan was expecting to see Senator Scott in Ta’if—perhaps early in the
                            afternoon. But shortly before Senator Scott’s meeting with King
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> (11:45 a.m.) he was
                            told Prince Sultan had changed his plans and would have to remain in
                            Riyadh.</p>
                        <p>3. That same day <gloss target="#t_USMTM_1">USMTM</gloss> General
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJH_1">Ahmann</persName> saw Prince Sultan in

                            Hawk Phase III <gloss target="#t_LOA_1">LOA</gloss>. General <persName

                            follows:</p>

                        <p><gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss> Prince Sultan opened the meeting
                            with a discussion of the letter from American <gloss target="#t_Amb_1"
                                >Amb</gloss> which is quoted in ref C. In his statements Sultan
                            reversed his position ref Triad/Northrop relations 180 degrees from
                            position that they took during his 14 July discussions with American
                                <gloss target="#t_Emb_1">Emb</gloss>. The points made by Sultan are
                            paraphrased as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. I cannot interfere with the business relations between two commercial
                            companies (Northrop and Triad). The two companies are not even Saudi
                            companies.</p>
                        <pb facs="0546" n="511" xml:id="pg_511"/>
                        <p>B. My position in this matter has been made very clear. First, I did
                            [not] know that fees were being paid by Northrop to Triad on earlier
                            phases of Peace Hawk. Second, there will be no future fees paid to
                            middlemen on any future Peace Hawk contract.</p>
                        <p>C. I am very disappointed that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            allowed such fees to be paid without advising me. I further consider
                            that since the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, not <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>, made the decision to allow payment of
                            fees the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, not <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>, should be responsible for quote
                            straightening out the present problems between Northrop and Triad
                            unquote.</p>
                        <p>At this point I referred to his (Sultan) earlier conversations with
                                <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> in which Sultan advised
                                <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> that he would take action
                            to ensure that Triad did not demand future commission payments by
                            Northrop. At this point, Sultan became visibly agitated and said in
                            effect quote yes, in verbal discussions with <gloss target="#t_Amb_1"
                                >Amb</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> I agreed that I would talk
                            to Kashoggi on this matter. I have done so. But I did not guarantee that
                            Triad would not demand an honoring of its contract with Northrop. There
                            is no way that I can put pressure on Triad or force it into such a
                            position unquote.</p>
                        <p>I then covered the fact that the Northrop contract would end on 16 Aug 75
                            and that note 8 of Amendment Two (2) to Peace Hawk Three made a
                            continuation of Northrop operation contingent upon quote the prior
                            termination of any preexisting agreements requiring Northrop to pay any
                            sales commission fees with respect to this amendment unquote. Sultan was
                            then briefed on the interim solution suggested by ref A. Sultan stated
                            that he had no objection to extending Northrop’s efforts in this manner
                            for 46 days, or even for two months, however, he further stated that he
                            would not sign Amendment Three until he received a letter from the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> (at least from the American
                                <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>) which officially answered the
                            following questions:</p>
                        <p>A. Why is the amendment valid for a period of 46 days as opposed to some
                            other time period?</p>
                        <p>B. What is the purpose of the extension? Is it to allow time for the
                            Northrop and Triad lawyers to effect a solution to their problem?</p>
                        <p>C. What are the estimated costs for this extended period of work and how
                            will it be financed? Answers were provided but Sultan reiterated that he
                            wanted an official letter from <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            answering these questions in writing before he would sign Amendment
                            Three.</p>
                        <p>Sultan then seemed to mellow somewhat from his agitated state and said
                            quote what is the solution to this whole problem? Unquote. I stated that
                            if Triad could not be convinced to abrogate their contract with Northrop
                            that I, personally, could see no workable solution. Sultan stated that
                            there is one solution. Since the Peace Hawk is government to government
                            program, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and specifically the
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss>, could <pb facs="0547"
                                n="512" xml:id="pg_512"/> replace Northrop with other contractors or
                            blue suiters to ensure that Phase III extension and Phase V continued
                            and the modernization/expansion of the <gloss target="#t_RSAF_1"
                                >RSAF</gloss> would not be adversely affected. I interjected that
                            even if this could be done Northrop would continue to be directly
                            involved in Peace Hawk IV and that the agents’ fee problem would
                            continue to exist in that area. At this point Sultan looked at the
                            ceiling and finally said quote I will repeat two points. One, I do not
                            want any fees paid to middlemen. Two, I cannot interfere in private
                            relations between commercial companies, unquote. Sultan’s attitude and
                            words in this area indicated to me that he was in effect saying that in
                            those parts of the program where Northrop must be involved let Northrop
                            and Triad come to a private arrangement but do not tell me.</p>
                        <p>Sultan then repeated his allegations that this whole problem of agents’
                            fees was caused by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> allowance of
                            agents’ fees in Phase One, Two and Three of Peace Hawk. He further
                            stated that it was his position that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> had to find a solution or that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> would find new aircraft and new people to help them
                            with the modernization of the <gloss target="#t_RSAF_1">RSAF</gloss>.
                            Finally, he said that he was preparing an answer to <gloss
                                target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> recent letter that would
                            explain his position fully. Sultan at this point said that he would like
                            to discuss the modernization of the Saudi Arabian Army (<gloss
                                target="#t_SAA_1">SAA</gloss>). In his monologue on this subject,
                            accompanied by continuous and vigorous head nodding on the part of his
                            four senior officers he made the following points:</p>
                        <p>A. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> did not give them what they
                            wanted, and what they need, in the impact package on the <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> and SP 155 Howitzer.</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, by refusing to make any type of
                            real commitment to <gloss target="#t_SAA_1">SAA</gloss> modernization in
                            view of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Middle East reassessment is
                            apparently forgetting the long and true friendship between US and <gloss
                                target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> and specifically forgetting the efforts
                            of <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> to keep oil prices down. <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> efforts in this area reduced <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s potential revenue considerably and
                            were motivated by pure friendship for <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>, not any political or monetary gain for Saudi Arabia.
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> by not being willing to make
                            any thing but gestures in response to the urgent request of 15 June 75
                            by <gloss target="#t_HRH_1">HRH</gloss> Princes <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> and himself was in fact
                            destroying the great friendship which has existed between Saudi Arabia
                            and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss></p>
                        <p>C. <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> could see potential enemies and
                            feared these potential enemies. They feel most strongly that they must
                            build up their capability to defend themselves. They want and need the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to help them in this area on an
                            expedited basis. If <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> chooses not to
                            help them, they will go to the devil himself to get armaments. Sultan
                            then smiled and said the devil includes Russia and China but, of course,
                            not Israel. At that point, I reminded Sultan of our earlier
                            conversations in which we had agreed that immediate delivery of
                            equipments listed on their 15 June 75 would not be practical from either
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> viewpoint <pb facs="0548" n="513" xml:id="pg_513"/> in
                            that extensive training of <gloss target="#t_SAA_1">SAA</gloss> in
                            operation and maintenance of equipment would be required before it could
                            be effectively integrated into <gloss target="#t_SAA_1">SAA</gloss>.
                            Sultan said that this was true but at this point <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> had made no major commitment to provide anything but
                            inadequate numbers of TOWs and SP 155s.</p>
                        <p>Sultan then said that he was sure that the President, Defense and State
                            wanted to assist <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> in modernization
                            and expansion of <gloss target="#t_SAA_1">SAA</gloss>. However, he was
                            sure that the trouble is with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Congress which is in his opinion too much affected by Zionists. I said
                            that if there are people attempting to destroy US/SAG friendship, you
                            will hand such people a victory.</p>
                        <p>Not by acting because of impatience. Sultan said there is a limit to our
                            patience. However, we still very much want to be friends and partners
                            with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and demonstrate this we
                            will:</p>
                        <p>A. Wait with increasing impatience until you have completed your Middle
                            East reassessment.</p>
                        <p>B. In the interim we will be conducting an American reassessment.</p>
                        <p>C. If we do not like the results of your Middle East reassessment, we
                            will be prepared to go elsewhere (including to the devil) for what we
                            need.</p>
                        <p>Discussions then turned to the proposed agreement on <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military training forwarded by ref C
                            and provided to Sultan by American Embassy Jidda as well as <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> cases AAA and AAB. Sultan again became
                            quite agitated and said the following:</p>
                        <p>A. We do not want to buy <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            partnership. It is not the money it is the principle. We want you and
                            your people here because <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> is our
                            friend not because we are reimbursing <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> for your salaries etc.</p>
                        <p>B. I do not think the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would have
                            made such a proposal to the late King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName>. I pointed out that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> did reimburse <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> for
                                <gloss target="#t_COE_1">COE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SANG_1"
                                >SANG</gloss> efforts. Sultan replied <gloss target="#t_COE_1"
                                >COE</gloss> builds buildings, <gloss target="#t_SANG_1"
                                >SANG</gloss> is involved with another <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> agency. Neither has same friendship meaning as <gloss
                                target="#t_USMTM_1">USMTM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I also pointed out that Iran was reimbursing <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> for our security assistance efforts. Sultan said Saudi
                            Arabia is a better friend to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> than
                            Iran. I also pointed out that primary motivating factor on reimbursement
                            was potential congressional pressure to reduce size of MAAGS/Missions
                            and potential adverse effects on <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>/Saudi relationship if disclosure was made in <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> news media that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> tax payer dollars were being used for
                            security assistance efforts in Saudi Arabia. Sultan ignored these points
                            and reiterated his statement that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            wanted American military here based on friendship not reimbursement.</p>
                        <p>Sultan then said that he wanted me to make sure that all points covered
                            in our meeting were forwarded to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            and specifically to <pb facs="0549" n="514" xml:id="pg_514"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName>. He then stated that he had
                            great confidence in <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> and in the in-country
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military effort. He then said
                            that he realized that he had been rather harsh in his reaction to the
                            support proposals and if there was anything I needed for <gloss
                                target="#t_USMTM_1">USMTM</gloss> it would be provided. Following a
                            discussion of promised leased family houses that had not been provided
                            as promised and need for additional housing at Dhahran and Riyadh Sultan
                            directed the <gloss target="#t_MODA_1">MODA</gloss> staff to immediately
                            provide the promised houses and to provide funds for the immediate
                            construction of five four bedroom houses for <gloss target="#t_USMTM_1"
                                >USMTM</gloss> at Dhahran and additional housing at Riyadh.</p>
                        <p>My overall evaluation of this meeting follows. I have provided a copy of
                            this message to <gloss target="#t_AmEmb_1">AmEmb</gloss> Jidda who might
                            want to provide their assessment.</p>
                        <p>A. Sultan has evidently been overruled within the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> on any efforts to force Kashoggi to
                            abrogate the Northrop-Triad contract. He is in a virtually untenable
                            situation. His statement in <gloss target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> news
                            media that there will be no commission fees on future
                            government-to-government programs leaves him no maneuvering room.</p>
                        <p>B. As a result, he has adopted a hard line which attempts to place blame
                            for commission fees on <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. I think
                            that he realizes the probable futility of this line since he, at one
                            point, suggested the compromise of alternate contractors or blue-suit
                            efforts to continue Phase Three and Phase Five. He obviously had not
                            thought out effect of his proposed compromise on Phase IV in which
                            Northrop must continue involvement. I was frankly surprised by his
                            apparent suggestion to pay agents’ fees in Phase IV as long as he is not
                            aware of them. This seemed to be a hip-shot answer which, in retrospect,
                            I suspect Sultan will disavow.</p>
                        <p>C. Unless Northrop-Triad negotiations have produced some breakthrough I
                            do not see where the discussions in this meeting led us any closer to
                            any acceptable solution on the fee question.</p>
                        <p>D. Unless some acceptable solution to fee problem is found, it is my
                            opinion that Sultan will be in considerable trouble within <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> and will lose confidence of <gloss
                                target="#t_RSAF_1">RSAF</gloss>. This could not fail to effect
                            standing and influence of <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>
                            in <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>. My perception is that this
                            situation [garble] and some solution acceptable to <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> must be found to avoid uncorrectable and wide crack in
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>/Saudi relations.</p>
                        <p>E. Discussion of the need for <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            commitment to a rapid modernization/expansion of <gloss
                                target="#t_SAA_1">SAA</gloss> were more brutal but not significantly
                            different in content from earlier discussions of this subject. However,
                            threat to go to Russia or China for assistance is a new one to me. As I
                            stated during discussions in Washington in July, <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> is looking for a very clear signal
                            that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> intends to take urgent actions
                            to assist <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> in fastest possible
                            modernization of <gloss target="#t_SAA_1">SAA</gloss>. Impact packages
                            were not enough of a signal. Unless we can give such a signal very soon
                                <gloss target="#t_MODA_1">MODA</gloss>
                            <pb facs="0550" n="515" xml:id="pg_515"/> will go elsewhere. Sultan’s
                            statement that they will wait for our Middle East reassessment is
                            tempered by his statement re an American reassessment. In this regard, I
                            believe the preliminary actions to obtain equipment from other sources
                            are already underway and that the longer it takes for Saudis to receive
                            the signal, the more likely the use of other suppliers.</p>
                        <p>F. I was surprised at the vehemence of Sultan’s reaction to support
                            proposals. Intensity of reaction could have been much affected by
                            general unhappiness of Sultan over fee situation and his perceived lack
                            of responsiveness of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to 14 June
                            1975 requests. At any rate, this attitude on part of <gloss
                                target="#t_MODA_1">MODA</gloss> must be changed or our ability to
                            accomplish an increased security assistance role is virtually nil.</p>
                        <p>G. Presence of our senior <gloss target="#t_SAAF_1">SAAF</gloss> officers
                            was surprising and unexpected. Anticipated that Sultan would prefer to
                            meet alone because of sensitivity of the problem. Sultan seemed to be
                            playing to the senior <gloss target="#t_SAAF_1">SAAF</gloss> officer
                            audience in his enunciation of his hard line in respect to fees and
                                <gloss target="#t_SAA_1">SAA</gloss> equipment requests. Presence of
                            these officers was particularly unexpected because of verbal information
                            I have been receiving that major reorganizations of <gloss
                                target="#t_SAAF_1">SAAF</gloss> designed to move younger officers
                            into positions of increased authority is in the offing.</p>
                        <p>H. Despite general hard line, I think Sultan desperately wants and needs
                            continued good relations with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> and,
                            in fact, is almost begging for some solution to fee problem and some
                            definite commitment re <gloss target="#t_SAA_1">SAA</gloss>
                            modernization. My reading of Sultan’s attitude even during his most
                            agitated and unfriendly statements was one that said in effect: <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, I have been your friend; now I am up
                            against the wall; help me find some solutions.</p>
                        <p>Suggest that time is more than ripe for high level <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> approach to <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> on whole subject of continued military cooperation and
                            specifically on the fee problem. Unless some firm agreements and
                            understandings are effected, major deterioration of military
                            relationship will be fast and irrevocable.</p>
                        <p>Request that you advise soonest on actions you intend to take relative to
                            requested letter forwarding Amendment Three to Peace Hawk Three <gloss
                                target="#t_LOA_1">LOA</gloss> and any specific actions you want me
                            to take on other matters.</p>
                        <p>4. Comment: I had the opportunity to review the Ambassador’s letter with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_AJH_1">Ahmann</persName> the evening of
                            August 9 and to discuss with him how we might best try to solve the
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>-Northrop commission problem. I
                            concur in the General’s analysis and comment and consider them
                            perceptive. Sultan has radically changed his position from the one he
                            expressed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> on
                            July 14 (ref C). His influence over Kashoggi was apparently not enough
                            to enable him to call Kashoggi off. I wonder in a real test of strength
                            if Kashoggi may be able to <pb facs="0551" n="516" xml:id="pg_516"/>
                            hurt Sultan’s personal and political status as much or more than Sultan
                            can hurt Kashoggi economically. It also seems clear Sultan couldn’t
                            obtain sufficient support from Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> and the Council of Ministers to a policy of getting
                            tough with Kashoggi. The feeling may have been: “It’s Sultan’s hot
                            potato, let him handle it.”</p>
                        <p>5. Sultan does not plan to change his position. This is suggested by the
                            broad attendance of <gloss target="#t_MODA_1">MODA</gloss> officers at
                            his meeting with General <persName corresp="#p_AJH_1">Ahmann</persName>,
                            and his proceeding directly to discuss the Ambassador’s letter. At
                            almost all other meetings with Sultan—even on less sensitive affairs—he
                            has been alone and has usually preferred us to provide the interpreter
                            as well. General <persName corresp="#p_AJH_1">Ahmann</persName> has told
                            me Sultan’s strong opposition to agents’ fees was extremely popular
                            among younger and middle-level officers. He could not try to change this
                            position without discrediting himself in the eyes of the officer corps.
                            The political damage to his position in the Council of Ministers would
                            be great also.</p>
                        <p>6. It appears to me that Sultan does not have it in his power to resolve
                            a Northrop-Triad confrontation. He knows—and we have told him—how this
                            could damage the Saudi Air Force. But what must now be uppermost in his
                            mind is how to ensure his continued authority and survival at the top
                            levels of the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>. To minimize the
                            damage to his position, I believe, he would let the Peace Hawk program
                            founder, and “blame the foreigner.” Should all remedies fail he would
                            heap the maximum amount of blame upon the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> for having misled him, and having welched upon its
                            commitments. The <gloss target="#t_RSAF_1">RSAF</gloss>’s problems would
                            be presented to the Saudi public as caused by the same
                            anti-Arab/pro-Israeli forces in Congress that have caused military
                            supply problems for two other good friends of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> in the Middle East: Jordan and
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>7. If the Peace Hawk program goes on the rocks as a result of this
                            imbroglio, <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> relations would suffer along a broad front. Sultan
                            would try to bounce back with his military constituents by promising
                            them even better aircraft from non-<gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            sources. (We think his mention of possible Russian or Chinese arms
                            sources was for impact; our bet would be on the British-French Jaguar.)
                            Our efforts to expand the work of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Saudi Joint Commission would suffer; our arguments for
                            Saudi cooperation on oil and finance would lose weight.</p>
                        <p>8. Action recommended. As Averell Harriman used to say after listening to
                            long analyses of a problem “What are we going to do about it?” We don’t
                            think it would help or change matters if we were to go to Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> with the kind of
                            arguments we’ve already made to Prince Sultan. We can be sure Northrop’s
                            fees have been discussed with <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>, but he has his own position to think of, and would
                            prefer to stay clear of this nasty problem.</p>
                        <p>9. A possible approach to a solution might be to inform Northrop of the
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s stand, and suggest that
                            lawyers for Northrop and Kas<pb facs="0552" n="517" xml:id="pg_517"
                            />hoggi each motivated by their principal’s interests seek an easement
                            whereby (a) Northrop obtained satisfactory assurance that Kashoggi would
                            not demand his entire pound of flesh—it might sink them; and (b)
                            Kashoggi would still get some profits and the prospect of more—which
                            would be better than what he would get now if Northrop refused to go
                            ahead with future phases of Peace Hawk.</p>
                        <p>10. A final possibility presents itself: If Prince Sultan cannot apply
                            pressure upon Kashoggi—since Kashoggi is not representing a Saudi
                            firm—could the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government in its
                            own political/defense interests help pressure Kashoggi to reach some
                            kind of workable agreement with Northrop that would not push the company
                            under, and allow Peace Hawk to go on?</p>
                        <p>11. As for answering Sultan’s questions about extending Northrop contract
                            46 days, recommend letter of reply be worked up between <gloss
                                target="#t_USMTM_1">USMTM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> and be presented to Sultan over General <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJH_1">Ahmann</persName>’s signature or mine. The
                            questions mostly deal with technical details of Peace Hawk contract and
                            we should have Ambassador for broader issues.</p>

                        <p>Your basic purpose in making a stop in Taif is to enlist Saudi support
                            for phase two of the Egyptian-Israeli disengagement. You will <pb
                                facs="0553" n="518" xml:id="pg_518"/> also seek to strengthen in
                            King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>, and in Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_SIFI_1">Saud bin Faisal</persName>, the new
                            Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, the conviction that you
                            personally, and the United States as a government, are firmly committed
                            to a final, peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
                            Additionally, you should seek to reassure the Saudis, including Prince
                            Sultan, the Minister of Defense, of our commitment to support the
                            modernization of the Saudi armed forces.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Specifically</hi>, your objectives will be:</p>
                        <p>—to allay Saudi fears that the implementation of this agreement will
                            diminish our concern for further progress, particularly on the
                            Syrian-Israeli front;</p>
                        <p>—to elicit Saudi support in our efforts to obtain Syrian acceptance of
                            the Israeli-Egyptian agreement;</p>
                        <p>—to reassure the Saudis that, despite Congressional actions toward Turkey
                            and Jordan, the Administration remains desirous of continuing to respond
                            to the needs of those countries for military equipment and that the
                            Administration would take the strongest action possible to insure that
                            nothing disturbs the harmonious military supply relationship now
                            existing between the United States and Saudi Arabia;</p>
                        <p>—to encourage the Saudis to use the leverage of economic assistance on
                            the Somalis toward the end of reducing and ultimately removing the
                            Soviet presence from Somalia;</p>
                        <p>—to encourage the Saudis to move ahead on their program of military
                            assistance to the Yemen Arab Republic by reaffirming our willingness to
                            sell reasonable amounts of military equipment;</p>
                        <p>—to assure <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> that we wish to
                            reach mutually satisfactory progress through the reconvened Preparatory
                            Producer-Consumer Conference and subsequent dialogue, and to emphasize
                            the deleterious effect on the Free World’s economy if there is another

                        <p>The assassination of King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> on March 25 did not disturb the fundamental
                            internal political stability which has characterized Saudi Arabia for
                            the past decade. Indeed, the smoothness of the transfer of power
                            provided visible evidence of the stability of Saudi governmental
                            institutions. The previous cabinet continued with only one major change:
                            the appointment of one of the late King’s sons, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SIFI_1">Saud bin Faisal</persName>, to the vacant
                            position (following Saqqaf’s death) of Minister of State for Foreign
                            Affairs, from his previous position as Deputy Minister of Petroleum and
                            Minerals.</p>
                        <p>The country now enjoys a form of dual leadership in which the
                            hard-working and competent Crown Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> relieves the quieter, <pb facs="0554" n="519"
                                xml:id="pg_519"/> more retiring King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName> of much of the burden of complicated
                            international and technical affairs. The King personally prefers a
                            ceremonial role but is forced by his position to participate in
                            discussions for which he is by education and experience inadequately
                            prepared. Care must be taken to extend to him, at least outwardly, the
                            deference and respect accorded his more capable predecessor. It is
                            likely that Crown Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>
                            will participate in all of your discussions with the King. These
                            discussions may take the form of a three-way dialogue in which you speak
                            to the King, who turns to the Crown Prince to reply. When unassisted,
                            the King has been known to ramble, to reply with pat cliches, and to
                            stray from the topic at hand.</p>
                        <p>One other noteworthy change accompanying the accession of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> was the elevation of Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_AS_1">Abdullah</persName> to the position of
                            Second Deputy Prime Minister, the number three position of leadership.
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_AS_1">Abdullah</persName> remains Commander
                            of the National Guard. He is likely to attend the meeting with the King,
                            but may be reluctant to speak, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>]. The elevation of <persName corresp="#p_AS_1"
                                >Abdullah</persName> to the number three position was strictly in
                            accordance with the principle that the senior leadership positions,
                            unless declined, are awarded to the sons of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud</persName> in order of
                            descending age. While Minister of Defense Sultan, junior to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AS_1">Abdullah</persName>, had no right to expect the
                            number three position himself, and has suffered no diminution of his own
                            personal power, he chafes under the new arrangement which now, in
                            meetings of the Council of Ministers, places Sultan in a position of
                            deference to <persName corresp="#p_AS_1">Abdullah</persName>, with whom
                            he could previously contend as an equal.</p>
                        <p>Our bilateral relations, while outwardly good, are troubled by Saudi
                            dissatisfaction with what they view as a lack of dispatch in responding
                            to requests for armaments; by doubts raised by Congressional treatment
                            of arms requests for Jordan and Turkey; by embarrassing revelations of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> Subcommittee that
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> funds have been used, in the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>-supervised Northrop F–5
                            contract, to pay large agents’ fees to a Saudi businessman, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Adnan Khashoggi</persName>, who may have made
                            improper payments to Saudi military officers; by different approaches
                            over the formula for reconvening the preparatory conference of oil
                            consumers and producers; and by the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            position on the Arab boycott and its anti-Jewish visa policy.</p>
                        <p>The Saudis’ main concern in talking to you, however, will be over the
                            question of future Israeli withdrawals in Sinai and Golan. Since this
                            second phase of the withdrawal has taken so long to achieve, the Saudis
                            will be asking for your prognosis concerning future withdrawals. The
                            Saudis will be concerned about the absence of substantial progress on
                            Golan and its effect on President Asad’s position. The Saudis view Asad
                            as a moderate in his own environment and will be <pb facs="0555" n="520"
                                xml:id="pg_520"/> concerned that a lack of progress on the Syrian
                            front will weaken his domestic position.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">YOUR APPROACH TO THE SAUDIS</p>
                        <p>In your opening remarks to King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName> you should begin by paying tribute to the memory
                            of King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>, from whom you
                            received much wisdom and good counsel. You should state that you look
                            forward to the benefit of similarly good counsel from His Royal Majesty.
                            You have already heard of His Majesty’s concern and interest in
                            improving the standard of housing and medical care in the Kingdom. All
                            of our efforts, in fact, are directed toward bringing peace to the
                            entire region so that each nation’s resources can be utilized in
                            improving the standard of living of all of its citizens, just as His
                            Majesty is attempting to do in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>In reviewing the steps which have led up to the present state of the
                            Middle East peace talks, you should:</p>
                        <p>—describe the delicate political situation in Israel and how this
                            complicates negotiations;</p>
                        <p>—reiterate the need for continued Saudi support of Egypt, especially
                            against attacks from Iraq and Libya;</p>
                        <p>—underline our commitment to do as much as possible to promote movement

                            these delicate negotiations and our hope that such Saudi support will
                            continue;</p>
                        <p>—discuss the consequences of a move to expel Israel from the United

                        <p>The Saudis have become very concerned at the treatment by Congress of
                            Turkey and Jordan over arms sales to these countries. They are puzzled
                            that we could treat an ally like Turkey or a close associate like Jordan
                            in such a fashion. They are also concerned that Congress may pass
                            restricting legislation, such as Senator <persName corresp="#p_KRT_1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>’s proposal for a six-month moratorium on arms
                            sales to the Persian Gulf. The Saudis have wondered aloud to a number of
                            recent visitors (including Senator Mansfield and Army Chief of Staff
                            Weyand) whether the US is a reliable partner for an important
                            political/military relationship.</p>
                        <p>The Saudis have also been watching closely how we respond to their
                            different arms requests. Before Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1"
                                >Akins</persName> left on leave <pb facs="0556" n="521"

                                >Fahd</persName> and Prince Sultan pressed him hard for decisions on
                            a number of items, some of which are new. Saudi unhappiness was
                            alleviated to some extent when the Ambassador was able to come back a
                            few weeks later and indicate we were prepared to sell 50 <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> launchers and 500 missiles (an initial
                            portion of a larger order), with deliveries within 120 days of Saudi
                            acceptance, and to lend 24 rehabilitated 155mm howitzers pending the
                            manufacture and delivery in 1977–78 of an order already contracted for.
                            There remain, however, a number of outstanding requests which have been
                            delayed either because (a) they are new and require a policy review and
                            decision (i.e., armored personnel carriers, M–60 tanks); (b)
                            presentation to the Congress has been delayed in light of recent
                            Congressional reaction over the Hawk sale to Jordan (i.e., construction
                            of harbor facilities for the Saudi navy) or (c) a decision has been put
                            off pending completion of the reassessment (i.e., briefing on advanced
                            aircraft—F–14, F–15, F–16, and F–18).</p>
                        <p>Saudi sensitivities have been further heightened by the activities of
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName>’s Subcommittee.
                            Recent revelations by Northrop before Senator <persName

                            Saudi military officers. The Saudi leadership is concerned lest it be in
                            for more disagreeable surprises when the Subcommittee scrutinizes the
                            activities of other American companies supplying military equipment or
                            services. Prince Sultan has recently affirmed, in the presence of his
                            senior generals, his opposition to the use of <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> funds for agents’ fees for military purchases, while
                            also maintaining that he is unable for legal reasons to insist that the
                            TRIAD firm of <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Adnan Khashoggi</persName>
                            agree to terminate its agency agreement with Northrop. Northrop
                            maintains to us that it will be unable to pay the required agents’ fees
                            out of company profits alone and that it will therefore be unable to

                        <p>—We have very much in mind pending Saudi requests for various military
                            equipment and services, and we will do all in our power to be as
                            responsive as possible. As you know, I asked Deputy Secretary of Defense
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> to visit Saudi
                            Arabia last April. I am aware that there are a number of outstanding
                            requests that have not been responded to. We should plan to have another
                            meeting of the Joint Security Commission fairly soon for another
                            in-depth review.</p>
                        <p>—During the period of our reassessment of the state of affairs in the
                            Middle East and at a time when Congress is taking increased <pb
                                facs="0557" n="522" xml:id="pg_522"/> interest in all aspects of our
                            arms sales, there have inevitably been some delays and obstacles which
                            we must work together to overcome. We have no intention of slowing down
                            the process of responding to Saudi requests, but the degree of public
                            interest does require careful consultation with Congress to get the
                            understanding needed to proceed with these requests. The Saudis must be
                            patient and accept our assurances that we are moving as fast as we
                            can.</p>
                        <p>—It is reasonable to assume that as we make more progress toward a
                            permanent peace in the Middle East, we can expect Congress and the
                            American public to become less sensitive to the sale of military
                            equipment and services destined for defensive needs of countries in the
                            Middle East.</p>
                        <p>—In response to my own inquiries into the matter, I understand that the
                            Department of Defense will soon be ready to brief the Royal Saudi Air
                            Force on the F–14, F–15 and F–16 aircraft and a concept briefing on the

                            proposing dates for this briefing. The Administration will shortly begin
                            consultations with the Congress to insure its understanding of the
                            considerations which led us to respond positively to Saudi wishes.</p>

                        <p>Oil Minister <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> had indicated
                            earlier that if a consumer/producer conference were to have any impact
                            on oil prices, the conference should take place before the <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> Ministerial on September 24. We have
                            explained to <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> why this is
                            not possible. We expect the French will issue invitations by the end of
                            August to a resumed Preparatory Conference in October. This, we believe,
                            will help moderate the size of any oil price increase.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> is insisting
                            on—and we have agreed to—the creation of a fourth Commission on Monetary
                            and Financial Affairs. The Saudis are interested primarily in seeking a
                            mechanism that will protect the value of their investments from
                            inflation. Our problem has been that the Saudi terms were so sweeping
                            and vague that this fourth Commission could have ended up preempting
                            work of the Group of 20. We are also concerned lest we get trapped in
                            trade-off positions between financial issues and raw material issues. We
                            have now accepted the establishment of a fourth commission but with
                            terms of reference that will limit its discussion of monetary reforms
                            and concentrate on the issues before the three other commissions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> also says that the success

                            membership, how members are selected, the functions of the secretariat,
                            and the means of inter-commission coordination. We recognize that these
                            problems exist but we believe that if all participants approach these
                            procedural problems with a view to working them out, they should be
                            quickly resolved.</p>

                        <p>—We are concerned over the serious international economic effects that
                            another increase in the price of oil would cause. We are also concerned
                            over the domestic effect such an increase would have on inflation and
                            unemployment, and on the progress we are beginning to make toward
                            economic recovery.</p>
                        <p>We would be interested in Saudi views on what can be expected at the next
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> meeting. We hope the Saudi
                            Government will take a long-term view of any decision on oil prices and
                            use its influence to hold the line against increases at the September
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> meeting, since it alone has
                            the power to do so. Saudi Arabia’s security—like our own—ultimately
                            depends on achieving a strong and healthy world economy.</p>
                        <p>—We are moving forward with our plans for the Prepcon which we expect
                            will resume in October. We are pleased that most of the procedural
                            issues have now been resolved and we feel that those remaining can be
                            dealt with quickly provided there is good will on both sides.</p>
                        <p>—On the question of the fourth Commission on Monetary and Financial
                            Affairs, because of the importance we attach to our relations with Saudi
                            Arabia and the major contribution we expect it to make to the
                            producer/consumer dialogue, we have agreed to its establishment. We
                            expect in return, however, that the Saudis will agree to limit its terms
                            of reference to assure that the commission does not get into areas which
                            are within the competence of existing and responsible international

                            nature of the Soviet presence at Berbera, during which briefings,
                            including aerial photos, were presented to Prince Saud, <persName

                            recognized the danger posed by the Soviets. In May, June, and July,
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> officials asked if the US was
                            prepared to cooperate in an attempt to induce the Somalis to remove the
                            Soviets. On July 14, Prince Saud reiterated questions previously asked:
                            would the US agree to supply Saudi-financed US arms to Somalia to
                            replace Soviet weaponry; would the US share equally the cost of
                            replacing the $60 million in Soviet economic aid now being provided? Our
                            response to date has been to state that our position is still under
                            study in Washington, but that Kenyan and Ethiopian sensitivities make
                            the question of arms sales to Somalia an especially sensitive issue. It
                            is likely that the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> will take
                            advantage of your visit to seek clarification of our position. Failure
                            to show continued interest in this problem will strengthen their present
                            suspicion that we raised the issue of Berbera to sell our position on

                            the importance of this issue and of the threat to the region and to
                            international shipping, posed by the Soviet presence in Berbera. We
                            share the desire to wean Somalia away from dependence on the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>—We are considering a modest aid program in Somalia as evidence of our
                            desire to improve relations and as a test of Somali responsiveness. <hi

                        <p>—We believe that consultations with Ethiopia and Kenya on arms sales are
                            premature and should only be undertaken when we can be absolutely
                            certain that US arms would be acceptable to the Somalis. Otherwise such
                            a step would needlessly alarm these two countries whose continued
                            cooperation we depend upon for maintenance of stability in the sensitive

                                >YAR</gloss>). In a letter from Ambassador <persName

                            May, we made a variety of recommendations to the Saudis on how to
                            proceed with the modernization program. The letter stressed that,
                            although we support balanced tri-service development, emphasis should be
                            given first to modernization of the Yemeni army. The Saudi response to
                            the letter was somewhat ambiguous. After the Yemenis threatened at the
                            beginning of July to turn to the Soviets for military training and
                            equipment, the Saudis promised to make specific commitments to the

                        <p>In order to be as helpful as possible, we have transmitted to our Embassy
                            in Jidda letters of offer covering a $1.5 million “impact package,”
                            which would be a first demonstrative step in a larger program. Later
                            steps which we have proposed to the Saudis include a shipment <pb
                                facs="0560" n="525" xml:id="pg_525"/> of 1,300 rifles—to equip one
                            Yemeni infantry brigade; engineering equipment; and eventually equipment
                            and training to cover the whole spectrum of an adequate modernization
                            program. We do not really have any idea at this point of what the Saudis
                            want, for they have not responded to many of the principles and concepts
                            which were proposed in our May letter. If current Saudi thinking is
                            still along the lines reflected in the shopping list which they gave to
                            us in September 1974, they are thinking in terms of a program with a
                            total cost in the range of $50 to $100 million.</p>
                        <p>We have tried to avoid pushing the Saudis too far on this program, lest
                            they revive the position they held until late last year—that is, the
                            United States should pay a substantial portion of the bill. At the same
                            time, we have encouraged the Yemenis to try to get the Saudis to commit
                            themselves to a real program.</p>
                        <p>It would be appropriate for you to raise the subject with the Saudi
                            leadership, and note the importance we attach to it. This would serve to

                            perhaps increase their forthcomingness with the Yemenis.</p>

                        <p>—I understand that your government has been very generous—in the amount
                            of some $700 million—in commitments of economic support to Prime
                            Minister Al-Ghani when he visited here a month ago. This is certainly a
                            wise policy on your part, since Yemen—with her large population—will
                            inevitably play an important role in Arabian Peninsula affairs,
                            regardless of her economic condition. I am sure you agree that
                            developments in South Yemen (<gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>)
                            will be most significantly influenced by progress in North Yemen.</p>
                        <p>—I understand that you are now prepared to make specific commitments to
                            modernize the Yemeni armed forces, and I wish to applaud your wisdom and
                            foresight in this decision. As you know, we stand ready to work with
                            you, to provide equipment and training as appropriate for North Yemen’s
                            defensive needs. To this end we have delivered letters of offer to cover
                            an “impact package”, which we think would be a prudent demonstrative
                            start on a comprehensive program. We are further prepared to offer you
                            further letters of offer covering such things as infantry rifles and
                            engineering equipment for early delivery.</p>

                        <p>—For the overall program, however, we would like to know more about your
                            thinking. We wish to work with you, but in order to be responsive, we
                            need to know more about your plans. If you will give us the broad
                            outlines of what you have in mind for the Yemeni army, navy, and air
                            force, we will fill in the details and make appropriate offers.</p>

                            <p>Northrop’s F–5 or “Peace Hawk” program with the Saudis under the
                                Foreign Military Sales program began in 1971 and is divided into
                                five phases rising in contract value from $42 million for Phase I to
                                possibly $2.04 billion for Phase V now under negotiation (see
                                attached table). Northrop’s agent, <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                    >Khashoggi</persName>, is contractually entitled to a 4–5%
                                commission on all Peace Hawk contracts.</p>
                            <p>Under US regulations governing the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                    >FMS</gloss> program (now being revised), sales commissions
                                could be included in the recoverable costs of the contract without
                                being specifically identified to the buyer government if <gloss
                                    target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> concluded they were reasonable.
                                    <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s test for reasonableness
                                appears to have been largely subjective and until recent months had
                                seldom rejected a proposed agent’s fee. As the price of Peace Hawk
                                contracts escalated, it became necessary for <gloss
                                    target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> to evaluate the reasonableness of
                                proposed agent’s fees far exceeding those it had <pb facs="0562"
                                    n="527" xml:id="pg_527"/> ever dealt with. This coincided with
                                the <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> Subcommittee
                                inquiry into Northrop’s overseas commission payments sparked by
                                disclosure that the company had channeled illegal campaign
                                contributions in the US through one of its European agents.</p>
                            <p>Instead of seeking discussion with the Saudis on the fee problem and
                                without consulting the Department or the Embassy, <gloss
                                    target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> sent a letter on March 6 to Saudi
                                Defense Minister Prince Sultan through the mail stating that it
                                could not evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed agent’s fee of
                                at least $45 million for the Phase V contract. It followed this up
                                with a similar inquiry regarding the $23 million fee for the Phase
                                IV contract which had already been signed. Sultan reacted by saying
                                he had no knowledge of prior agent’s fees and directing that none be
                                paid for <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> sales to his Ministry.
                                Though we were eager to comply, Northrop advised us that its
                                contract with <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>
                                required commissions on all Peace Hawk sales and that the company
                                could not continue its program in Saudi Arabia unless it could
                                recover commission costs.</p>
                            <p>In his recent trip to Jidda, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1"
                                    >Akins</persName> discussed this problem with Sultan who agreed
                                to ensure that <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>
                                would waive his contract rights to permit Northrop to continue its
                                Peace Hawk program. <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName>, however, argued his case stating that Sultan
                                had no authority to compel TRIAD, a non-Saudi company, to terminate
                                its agency agreement with Northrop. Sultan has now shifted his
                                position saying that he cannot interfere with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>’s contract while
                                continuing to insist that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                                ensure that no agent’s fees are paid on Peace Hawk, if necessary by
                                changing contractors or assigning US Air Force personnel to carry
                                out the project.</p>
                            <p>We consider that Northrop’s involvement in the project is essential
                                to its smooth continuation and we are exploring means to this end
                                with <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> and Northrop
                                representatives. These could include assigning blue suiters (<gloss
                                    target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> estimates about 500 would be
                                required), having another company take over the
                                maintenance/training/construction part of the program, or
                                encouraging Northrop obtain a release from its contractual
                                obligations to <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>.
                                Though we contemplate no further exchanges with Sultan at this time,
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> upon his
                                return to Jidda may be able to detect more flexibility in the Saudi
                                position than is apparent in past formal pronouncements.</p>

                                jockeying for position to scrutinize Lockheed’s overseas sales
                                promotion payments. These total $202 million since 1970 with nearly
                                half going to <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>.
                                Since all Lockheed’s sales in Saudi <pb facs="0563" n="528"

                                legal complications such as those generated by Northrop’s problems.
                                However, full disclosure of Lockheed’s payments may prove far more
                                damaging to Saudi-US relations since we understand that the Lockheed
                                documents strongly indicate payments through <persName

                            <p>Lockheed’s legal counsel has agreed to permit us to read potentially
                                damaging documents when and if they conclude that their public

                            <p>Raytheon expects to follow Lockheed on the block. Its sales to Saudi
                                Arabia have also been outside of the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                    >FMS</gloss> program and produced something in excess of $50
                                million in commissions for <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                    >Khashoggi</persName>. Raytheon is currently negotiating a

                                which could approach $1 billion where the agents fee might exceed
                                20%. Raytheon, however, realizes that the commission is too large to
                                justify as fair payment for services rendered and has decided it
                                must discontinue negotiations unless it can secure a release or an

                        <p>I am writing with regard to a report appearing today in our press that we
                            are planning to make some changes in our Ambassadors overseas including
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName>, and attributing
                            this to proposed changes in American policy.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that Your Majesty will not give credence to any report
                            that we envisage changes in our policy toward Saudi Arabia. That policy
                            has always been based on a firm conviction that United States and Saudi
                            interests are best served by a relationship of confidence, friendship,
                            and cooperation. It remains our intention to do everything possible to
                            strengthen the relations between our two countries in the future as we
                            have in the past.</p>
                        <p>It is true that we do envisage some changes in Ambassadors. I very much
                            regret that this fact has been published prematurely, but I want you to
                            know that it is our intention to seek soon Your Majesty’s agreement to
                            accredit to Saudi Arabia one of our most respected and senior
                            professional diplomats. Our present thinking is that this change would
                            not occur much before the end of the year, and meanwhile I want to
                            assure you of our continued full confidence in Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> and in Mr. <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_SIFI_1">Sa’ud</persName> August 20. <persName

                            Chargé told him Secretary’s letter made distinction between some of
                            Kraft’s info—which may in part have been correct—and the interpretations
                            Kraft was putting on that info. <persName corresp="#p_SIFI_1"
                                >Sa’ud</persName> said Kraft’s sources were nevertheless very good,
                            and that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> was handling diplomatic

                            probably the less we say henceforth the better. <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"

                            news on military supply would be reassuring—especially to <persName

                            agreement. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. I saw Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_SIFI_1">Sa’ud</persName> at 1900 local August 20. I told
                            him Joseph Kraft had the day before published a column discussing the
                            significance of various ambassadorial shifts which he said were planned.
                            I had a letter from the Secretary to His Majesty on this subject. Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_SIFI_1">Sa’ud</persName> replied he had read
                            the Kraft article that morning.</p>
                        <p>2. After reading the letter he said “it looks as if Kraft was right.” I
                            answered that the essential point of your letter had been to distinguish
                            between Kraft’s information on ambassadorial changes—some of which was
                            correct—and the significance he attributed to them. Kraft was an able,
                            imaginative reporter and the conclusions he drew about a shift in the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> disposition toward Saudi Arabia
                            were his own and not those of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Government. <persName corresp="#p_SIFI_1">Sa’ud</persName> said he hoped
                            so. He remembered, however, that some very sensitive discussions between
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> had been accurately
                            reported in one of Kraft’s columns and that his sources seemed very
                            authoritative.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SIFI_1">Sa’ud</persName> asked if it was true
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">William Porter</persName>
                            would be coming to Saudi Arabia. I said I didn’t know and could not
                            comment. <persName corresp="#p_SIFI_1">Sa’ud</persName> said he’d wait
                            and see but that it seemed to him the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> was handling relations with one of its oldest and
                            closest friends in the area in an unusual way.</p>
                        <p>4. Comment: (A) There’s probably nothing we can say that will keep the
                            Saudis from speculating that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1"
                                >Akins</persName>’ departure portends a cold spell in <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi relations. They will be
                            discomposed—especially Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>. (B) It will be easy for us to protest too much,
                            and I think henceforth, the less said about the implications of the
                            shift, the better. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> official people
                            in Saudi Arabia are making no comment when asked about the Kraft report.
                            (C) When you come to Taif you might briefly repeat the assurances in
                            your letter and express regret over the leak. You might also tell the
                            Saudis the name of the new Ambassador. To keep it in [garble] would be
                            to tantalize them. If <pb facs="0567" n="532" xml:id="pg_532"/> you
                            yourself asked for the agreement the nomination would be off to a good
                            start. (D) The <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> will be watching our
                            actions closely for signals. If we want to reassure them that we really
                            mean what we say it would be good if Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> could soon give them some
                            agreeable news—perhaps about delivery of military items. (E) Finally, we
                            really ought to improve personnel handling of Ambassadors. The last one
                            I worked with first learned of his transfer when he received a message
                            requesting agreement for his successor. When the ligatures between
                            ambassadorships are ragged, our friends get apprehensive. They wonder if
                            their great ally is as stable, nerveless and systematic as they count on
                            him to be.</p>

                        <p>6008. Pls pass Secretary’s party. Subject: Assignment of New Ambassador
                            to Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>1. Immediately on his return to Jidda August 24, Counselor of Embassy Isa
                            Sabbagh received word that Crown Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> wanted to see him as soon as possible. Counselor
                            Sabbagh saw the Prince the following day in Taif.</p>
                        <p>2. Crown Prince told Counselor Sabbagh that the subject of the
                            Ambassador’s transfer dominated the last three Cabinet meetings. He said
                            no Saudi doubted the Kraft allegation that the United States was trying
                            to “send a signal” to Saudi Arabia; that it intended to adopt a new hard
                            line. But, <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said, if the
                            United States thinks it will be able to bend Saudi Arabia to its wishes
                            by this method it is mistaken.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> was the best Ambassador
                            who had ever been in Saudi Arabia; and on the basis of what he had
                            accomplished here for the United States the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> would certainly have to agree. He listed the lifting of
                            the oil boycott, the moderate position Saudi <pb facs="0568" n="533"
                                xml:id="pg_533"/> Arabia had taken on oil prices, the formation of
                            the Joint Commission, extraordinary advance of American business in the
                            Kingdom in the last two years and American domination of the military as
                            examples of things accomplished by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said that King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> had given all Cabinet
                            Ministers orders to receive the Ambassador whenever he wished (we had
                            been told this by several other Ministers) and asked if the Ambassador
                            had ever had trouble seeing the King, the Crown Prince, or any other
                            Cabinet member. Counselor Sabbagh said he thought not. The Prince said
                            the new Ambassador would have a difficult time seeing any Minister and
                            he asked about Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName>.
                            Mr. Sabbagh said he did not know him.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> saw Petroleum
                            Minister, at the Minister’s request, August 26. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> also asked about Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> who, Kraft claims, is
                            coming to Jidda. The Ambassador said he knew Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> very well, that he was one of
                            the best officers we had in our Foreign Service, that he would be
                            honored to have him replace him and it would be difficult for the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to choose a better man for this job or
                            any job. <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1">Yamani</persName> said that was
                            too bad because Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName>
                            would not be able to function in Saudi Arabia. “He will see me only on
                            the rarest occasion and if he ever raises the subject of oil prices, he
                            will be declared persona non grata.”</p>
                        <p>6. The Secretary should be prepared to answer Saudi questions on the
                            subject when he arrives.</p>

                            I want to thank Your Majesty for a very warm welcome. Your hospitality
                            is always so generous.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>:</hi> I
                            hope you are not too tired. Is it safe to say you are by now used to
                            such a hectic pace? The papers and radio are saying that you have
                            travelled tens of thousands of miles just to get 8 miles for Egypt, but
                            it is more than 8 if you measure it from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            It is really about 50 kilometers if you measure from the Suez Canal to
                            the new Israeli line.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>:</hi>
                            We thank God that your mission succeeded.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            I thank Your Majesty for your very warm reception. It is typical of the
                            Kingdom.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>:</hi>
                            We wish you could stay for a rest. The climate in Taif is very
                            invigorating, although it can become unsettled, even with showers, in
                            the afternoon.</p>
                        <pb facs="0570" n="535" xml:id="pg_535"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            As I told His Highness, Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>, we are grateful that progress has been made but it
                            is only a first step in the progress which must lead to an overall
                            settlement. For the past 48 hours my colleagues and I have had almost no
                            sleep because we were constantly going back and forth from Israel to
                            Egypt to pin down the negotiations. As I said to His Highness, the only
                            smiling faces we have seen have been in Arab countries, not in
                            Israel.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>:</hi>
                            We have a bedouin expression that this kind of fatigue shall produce a
                            good result because it comes from a good effort. We all hope this is a
                            step in the right direction and that the next step will have still
                            greater progress.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            We shall try to get another agreement on the Syrian front. We will make
                            a significant effort even though the problem is extremely difficult.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>:</hi>
                            We hope you do not turn your back on the Syrians, or on the
                            Palestinians, either. If you ignore those who own the territory, there
                            is no possibility of a solution. You must not ignore Jerusalem,
                            either.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            I said last night in both Jerusalem and Alexandria that this is only a
                            step and that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will continue to
                            participate in the process of moving toward peace. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> made the same point very strongly
                            in announcing the Agreement. I will ask our Ambassador to send Your
                            Majesty a text of our President’s statement.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>:</hi> I
                            hope that upon your return to Washington, you will see to the supply of
                            the arms they need for Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Pakistan. Of course,
                            Prince Sultan wants our needs to be met first, but we must also worry
                            about the others. They have legitimate needs and they are all fighting
                            against Communism.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            We agree. They need to be helped. It is in our own national interest. I
                            have had preliminary discussions on this with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>:</hi>
                            Turkey is very important strategically since it guards the Bosphorus and
                            the entrance to the Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            The Congressional decision on Turkish arms was one of the most
                            short-sighted ever taken by a legislative body. We shall request a
                            change in the law when Congress returns and I think we have a good
                            chance of getting it through this month.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>:</hi>
                            Turkey is really more important to you than to us.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            That is true. Jordan is also a problem with Congress and we will try to
                            get a favorable decision on HAWKs for Jordan this month.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>:</hi>
                            Pakistan is facing two deadly enemies on its borders—India and <gloss

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            But the Pakistanis have no money. The problem is not with us. We have
                            removed the embargo.</p>

                            I have the impression that someone has been talking to Your Majesty

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>:</hi>
                            Let them pay in installments. We and Iran are the only countries in the
                            area who could help but we have set aside money for so many projects.
                            Instead of giving wheat to the Soviets, help your friends.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            The Soviets pay in cash and if <persName corresp="#p_YAZ_1"
                                >Yamani</persName> does not behave we will make them pay in oil.</p>

                            You have an obligation to help the Pakistanis. They have had floods and

                            I told him about the status of the negotiations. I like him very

                            This is the impression conveyed to us by your Ambassador and it has been
                            the same policy for many years. You must see this the way we do.</p>

                            We don’t want Sultan to be annoyed, so don’t forget about our arms. We

                            We are not used to dealing with countries that can pay cash but I think
                            I brought some good news to Sultan and I think we solved most, if not

                        <p>Summary: During a meeting with <gloss target="#t_MinDef_1">MinDef</gloss>
                            Prince Sultan September 10, Ambassador pointed out that problems related
                            to Northrop Corporation’s F–5 projects and payment of agent’s fees had
                            been postponed but not solved. Unless Northrop’s agent <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Adnan Khashoggi</persName> could be persuaded to
                            relinquish his agent’s fees, Northrop might have no choice but to go
                            bankrupt, or cease operations in Saudi Arabia. Either way the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s interests would be hurt. Sultan said
                            Northrop’s problems were not his fault; he had a contract with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, and he expected the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to stand behind it. He suggested the
                            replacement of Northrop personnel by Blue Suiters, or that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>—which had started the problem—change
                            its laws or pressure <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> to
                            give up his claims. Sultan was impressed however to learn that appeals
                            by governments of Jordan and Iran to Northrop agents in their countries
                            had been successful. He said if <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            could provide him with a letter giving details <pb facs="0573" n="538"
                                xml:id="pg_538"/> of the successful action against agents in Iran
                            and Jordan, he was willing to have another crack at <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>. Sultan also intends to
                            promulgate a comprehensive ban against all agent’s fees for military
                            sales, either by the <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> or government
                            to contractor route. He and his lawyers wonder if such an order—if
                            issued by a sufficiently high and authoritative Saudi Governmental
                            body—would give the Northrop Corporation and other companies an out
                            before <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> laws on grounds of force
                            majeure. His legal advisors and Min State for Foreign Affairs Prince
                            Saud are working on such a <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            statement of policy. Would this work? Could Dept provide a letter giving
                            details of successful pressure against Northrop agents in Jordan and
                            Iran? End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. Ambassador met with <gloss target="#t_MinDef_1">MinDef</gloss> Prince
                            Sultan <persName corresp="#p_SIAS_1">bin Abd al-Aziz</persName> in Taif
                            afternoon September 10 to discuss numerous US/Saudi military questions
                            (septels). Following the six month extension to February, 1976 on Peace
                            Hawk III, the Ambassador said the problem Northrop Corporation faced
                            with Agent’s fees in the Peace Hawk Program had been postponed, but not
                            solved. The total amount of fees due to <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Adnan Khashoggi</persName> under the subsequent phases of the Peace
                            Hawk Program, could total well above $80 million. These amounts—as had
                            previously been pointed out to Prince Sultan—would exceed the company’s
                            profits in any operating year. Since company lawyers had concluded there
                            was no way Northrop could avoid payment of <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName>’s fees on the Peace Hawk Program—whether or
                            not these fees were allowed by the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            as part of the total cost of the Program—the company faced either
                            bankruptcy or a need to withdraw from its Saudi Arabian operations. The
                            Ambassador noted that <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>
                            was extremely rich, and he had thought that <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName> might be susceptible to an appeal from the
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> to his Saudi Arabian
                            patriotism. Surely <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>
                            would not want to harm the well-being of a country that had furnished
                            him the basis for his present financial well-being, and could continue
                            to be important to him in the future?</p>
                        <p>2. Prince Sultan said the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> must be
                            fair, and recognize this was really not his problem. He was in no way to
                            blame for Northrop’s difficulties. He had been dealing for years on this
                            program with the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and had never been
                            told by any Ambassador or <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            representative, before <gloss target="#t_Asst_1">Asst</gloss> Secretary
                            of Defense <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>, that
                            agent’s fees were involved in <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            cases. He noted, moreover, that all of these sales cases included a
                            statement to the affect that “no agent’s or commission’s fees had been
                            paid to obtain the aforementioned contract.” He said that his contract
                            moreover was not with Northrop but with the United States Government,
                            and he expected the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to stand behind
                            its commitments. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> therefore
                            could pay the agent’s fees itself, or take over the operation of the
                            contract with Blue Suiters, or change the law under which <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> had a hold on the Northrop
                            Corporation. The trouble <pb facs="0574" n="539" xml:id="pg_539"/> all
                            came about because of the Department of Defense and Congress, and they
                            should try their hand at solving it. If it was the intention of the US
                            to harm its political and military relationships with Saudi Arabia, it
                            should speak more plainly. In the meantime, he was in no way to blame
                            for Northrop’s debacle. At this point Sultan called in his legal advisor
                            Dr. Ghazi Nuseibeh and reviewed for him the preceeding discussion.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> said that from
                            the standpoint of equity there was something to be said for Prince
                            Sultan’s position. On the other hand, as a practical matter, and as a
                            matter of realism, he could assure the Prince the US Government would
                            not repeat not pay <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>’s
                            agent’s fees, nor would it take over the operation of the Northrop
                            contract. He asked again if there were not a possibility that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> might forego his commission
                            on succeeding portions of the Peace Hawk contract? It seemed to the
                            Ambassador he could be asked to pass up this particular opportunity for
                            profit. Alternatively, the Ambassador, who thought Sultan might have
                            been looking for ways out of the impasse, asked if he (Sultan) had ever
                            thought of considering Peace Hawk IV and V as part of the overall Peace
                            Hawk effort, and therefore part of an old case. In these circumstances
                            agent’s fees might still be payable notwithstanding the strong and clear
                            position his Royal Highness had taken last spring against future
                            payments of such amounts.</p>
                        <p>4. Sultan said he could never do that. Such an attempt to get around the
                            clear dictates of law and morality would be wrong. It would never be
                            accepted by the Council of Ministers nor by the Saudi public at large.
                            He would not even wish to mention such chicanery to any Saudi official.
                            Sultan asked why the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> didn’t try to
                            put pressure on <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>?
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName>’s corporation after
                            all was not Saudi but American. <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName> had many business interests in the United
                            States and Sultan thought the US Government could easily let <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> know that his stubbornness
                            was hurting US interests, and that as an important American businessman
                            he ought to withdraw his claims against Northrop. It seemed to Sultan
                            that an approach to <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> by
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would be more logical, and also
                            more likely to get results.</p>
                        <p>5. The Ambassador again argued that surely <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName> would not and could not remain indifferent to
                            an appeal to his patriotism and to his business future from the Saudi
                            Arabian Government. He noted that when faced with a similar situation
                            the Shah and King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> both
                            had forced—in the name of their country’s defense interests—local agents
                            to stand down from their legal rights. Surely claims of national
                            interest were just as binding upon Saudi citizens? Sultan said this was
                            of course true, and asked the Ambassador whether the situations in Iran
                            and Jordan were actually comparable to the one they were discussing <pb
                                facs="0575" n="540" xml:id="pg_540"/> in Saudi Arabia. The
                            Ambassador said to the best of his knowledge they were. Sultan then said
                            he would be willing to have another go at <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName>, and would again try to persuade his fellow
                            ministers to support him if the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            could provide him with an official letter stating (A) the similar nature
                            of the Northrop contracts in Iran/Jordan/Saudi Arabia, (B) the action
                            the other governments had taken—either via royal order, a parliamentary
                            decree or some executive order against the agent, (C) the response of
                            the agent and (D) an affirmation that the agent’s fees were subtracted
                            from the previous total of the government to government contract. Sultan
                            also said that because he would have to cite <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName> by name, he would like the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s letter specifically to mention the
                            identity of the agents in the other countries. The Ambassador said he
                            would see what kind of a letter along these lines he could obtain from
                            Washington. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Prince Saud here
                            joined the discussion.</p>
                        <p>6. Sultan told Saud the question of agent’s fees had been a bothersome
                            one and all these fees must be stopped. He asked the Ambassador if all
                            other US companies had paid large agents’ fees? The Ambassador said,
                            that of the companies now being investigated in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, Raytheon paid large agent’s fees on
                            its contractor to government sales, but he had been assured by the
                            company that it had paid no bribes. The Saudi Government therefore
                            probably should not expect hostile Congressional attention to be given
                            to the Hawk missile and the improved Hawk missile contracts with
                            Raytheon as with the Northrop or Lockheed contracts where alleged bribes
                            were also involved. He also told the Prince, that as a result of the
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s stand on <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> cases, US regulations had been changed
                            to require a clear statement of the amount of the agent’s fees. The
                            regulations would soon also require a similar statement of agents fees
                            on all contractor to government sales as well.</p>
                        <p>7. Sultan thought this was excellent and should have been done long ago.
                            He had been discussing the agent’s fees problem with Crown Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> and Prince Saud, and
                            was preparing a government instruction that would (A) prohibit payment
                            of any agent’s fees for any military-type sale, from any nation, be the
                            sale <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> or government to contractor.
                            (The Prince was confident the Council of Ministers would agree to apply
                            this ban to para-military organizations such as the National Guard as
                            well), and (B) prohibit any non-Saudis from functioning as agents for
                            any projects in the civilian sector, and (C) prohibit non-Saudis from
                            receiving any portion of agent’s fees. Sultan spoke indignantly about
                            the numerous Lebanese that were benefiting from the lucrative agent’s
                            practice in Saudi Arabia. If this continued, he imagined the only jobs
                            hard-working Saudi citizens could find in a year would be on the
                            government payroll. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not

                        <p>8. Going back to Northrop’s problems, Sultan wondered why his earlier
                            prohibition of agents fees—which he noted had been publicly <pb
                                facs="0576" n="541" xml:id="pg_541"/> read throughout the
                            Kingdom—did not allow Northrop to plead force majeure in the courts of
                            California. Could the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> strengthen
                            the ban? Prince Saud and Dr. Nuseibeh thought this might help Northrop.
                            Saud did not believe it would be necessary to go as far as issuing a
                            royal decree on the subject; Dr. Nuseibeh agreed. Sultan said he might,
                            as Minister of Defense, address such an order to the chairman of the
                            Council of Ministers, Crown Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>, and ask the Crown Prince to promulgate it in his
                            name, or in that of the Council of Ministers. The legal standing of such
                            an order would be identical to that of a Royal Decree, and—faced by the
                            prospect of official displeasure and an absolute ban against payment of
                            agents’ fees any place—the company would have an effective basis on
                            which to make a force majeure argument in American courts. Prince Saud
                            and Dr. Nuseibeh were instructed to get to work on the project
                            immediately. Sultan said he would provide the Embassy with a copy of
                            whatever was promulgated, and in the meantime he hoped the Ambassador
                            would try and get as soon as possible from the Department a letter along
                            the lines mentioned in paragraph 5 above.</p>
                        <p>9. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> made a
                            strong case for himself with the Council of Ministers, evidently
                            overriding Sultan’s earlier decision. His victory, equally evident, was
                            not repeat not complete. If Sultan had been looking for ways to continue
                            payments to <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> he surely
                            would have considered the exit raised in paragraph 3. Not only did he
                            reject vigorously the possibility of continuing some agents fees in this
                            particular <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> case but he proposes
                            stopping all agents fees on all military contracts—including the
                            National Guard. If these new regulations are actually promulgated Saudi
                            Arabia will have taken a long step forward; it will have removed a major
                            irritant to the young or more honest in the officer corps, and hence
                            have enhanced chances for continued stability in the Kingdom.</p>

                            the new Saudi orders will apply to government-company contracts as well
                            as <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> cases and that as a result of

                            Lockheed Bribe.</p>
                        <p>Summary: On September 10, I told Minister of Defense Prince Sultan that
                            Lockheed had admitted paying some $20 million in bribes overseas, and
                            that Senators <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_PW_2">Proxmire</persName> were pressing the
                            company and the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> for the names of
                            the bribe recipients. Lockheed records showed that according to Adnan
                            Kashoggi, [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] had received
                            some of this money. Sultan said the Department or President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> must do whatever is necessary to
                            make sure the names are never divulged. The claims were obviously false,
                            but if they were made by the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Congress they have to be taken by the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> as an indication of deliberate <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> hostility. It would mean the end of the special <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi relationship, and Sultan did not
                            exclude Saudi Arabia’s turning to the Soviets on the rebound. I urged
                            Sultan not to overreact; if he did so the anti-Arab elements in the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> would have won their game.
                            Sultan wants copies of all information on Lockheed that has been given
                            to the Department of State. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. I saw Minister of Defense Prince Sultan Sept 10 and told him we had
                            very disturbing information about the way Lockheed has been doing
                            business overseas: Lockheed has admitted to paying some $20 million in
                            bribes to promote its exports, and two Committees headed respectively by
                            Senators <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_PW_2">Proxmire</persName> were investigating the
                            company. I also told Sultan that the Committees were demanding to know
                            to which countries these monies had been paid, and specifically who were
                            the recipients in each. I said Lockheed and the Department of State were
                            standing firm against divulging the names of alleged payees, but that
                            congressional pressure would certainly continue and <pb facs="0578"
                                n="543" xml:id="pg_543"/> increase. This was of concern to us
                            because Lockheed records claim that some bribes went to [<hi
                                rend="italic">names not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>2. I said my presentation was in line with my earlier assurances to him
                            that we would keep him informed on all developments to do with Congress’
                            scrutiny of bribes and agents’ fee. If it looked as if the company would
                            be compelled to release the names to the Congress, I would let him know
                            as soon as the news reached me, whatever the hour of day or night. I
                            assured the Prince the only persons aware of this information—apart from
                            the head of Lockheed and some of the company’s lawyers—were a handful of
                            top State Department officials, my secretary, and my Deputy, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HH_1">Hume Horan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. The only Saudis I had discussed this with were Foreign Minister Prince
                            Saud, who had asked to be briefed (Saud took notes, remarked only that
                            “this could be very serious” and asked that I give the same information
                            to Crown Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> and Prince
                            Sultan), and Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> who
                            listened with great interest. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> said the investigations were clearly inspired by
                            the opponents of good Arab-American relations and asked that we discuss
                            the matter more fully later.</p>
                        <p>4. I informed Sultan that Lockheed records apparently showed the monies
                            had been paid to Adnan Kashoggi, and that they had been placed in
                            numbered Swiss banks. We had only Kashoggi’s word, however, (as stated
                            in Lockheed files and correspondence) that the accounts were those of
                                [<hi rend="italic">names not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>5. Sultan said the names cannot <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not
                            ever be revealed. The Department of State and—if necessary—President
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> must do whatever is
                            needed to ensure in this respect the continued privacy and inviolability
                            of Lockheed’s files. Sultan said it was inconceivable to him how anyone
                            who was familiar with the personal wealth of the Saud family, [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] should ever
                            think one of them would ever be party to such a heinous and elaborate
                            circumlocution for a paltry few million dollars. But this was not the
                            point. Sultan knew that if such an accusation were made with the stature
                            of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Congress behind it, its
                            official <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> nature would be
                            universally believed. The results would be drastic. They would be felt
                            in the Saudi Arabian Government—but the Saudi Arabian Government, Sultan
                            said, was not the government of [<hi rend="italic">names not
                                declassified</hi>] alone. It was many more people than they; in
                            fact, it was the entire state. The effect of such an accusation would be
                            the end <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> the end of the special
                            relationship between the United States of America and the Kingdom of
                            Saudi Arabia. In measured, serious tones Sultan adjured the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government to end discussions and
                            speculation of the Lockheed case by whatever means and whatever efforts
                            that required.</p>
                        <p>6. I told Sultan I would pass this message on to you just as he had
                            expressed it to me. Sultan added—in the same quiet and direct mode <pb
                                facs="0579" n="544" xml:id="pg_544"/> of address he had used
                            earlier—that if the United States was intending systematically to harass
                            Saudi Arabia it should speak plainly and let the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> know. For his part, the Saudi Arabian
                            Government wanted to remind the United States Government that others,
                            including even the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics would always be
                            glad to help Saudi Arabia if the United States persisted in its
                            unfriendly stance. Syria and Egypt had already shown the Arab world how
                            Soviet arms, and a Soviet presence were compatible with continued
                            self-respect and national sovereignty. Sultan added this was not said as
                            a threat but as a fact. He hoped that circumstances would permit the
                            Saudi Arabian Government to remain a friend of the United States in the
                            Middle East.</p>
                        <p>7. Sultan closed this portion of the discussion by saying that he wanted
                            to receive as soon as possible copies of all the original material on
                            the Lockheed case that the Department of State possesses. I commented,
                            as I had previously to Prince Saud and Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> that the Saudis must not <gloss
                                target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not overreact. Sultan might be right
                            in assuming anti-Arab elements would exploit the investigations but if
                            Saudi Arabia turns against the United States its enemies will have won
                            their game.</p>
                        <p>8. Comment: If the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] names are leaked to the media by the
                            investigating committees, the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> will
                            claim loudly it is the victim of a pro-Zionist conspiracy. It will react
                            against the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> as a whole because (a)
                            it can’t direct its reactions to one branch of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and not another; and because (b) from
                            its standpoint, Zionists would be in any case the predominant element
                            and the only ones to profit. It is only this last point that might
                            enable us to salvage the situation if the names (God forbid) are
                            released. It is certainly the point I intend to keep hammering on in all
                            future discussions of the subject.</p>
                        <p>9. Action requested: Receipt of all pertinent Lockheed materials for
                            delivery to Prince Sultan, i.e. all documents already given to the

                        <p>6332. Subject: Sultan’s Further Views on Lockheed Bribes. Ref: A) 218708;
                            B) State 218793; C) Jidda 6333.</p>
                        <p>1. Yesterday morning, immediately on receiving ref A, I told Prince Saud
                            that the names had not been given to the Congress. He replied that we
                            should be thankful for small blessings and he trusted that the
                            administration would ensure that the names are never given to Congress.
                            He said that Prince Sultan would still want to see me the following
                            day.</p>
                        <p>2. I saw the Prince at one o’clock this afternoon (10 <gloss
                                target="#t_GMT_1">GMT</gloss> Sept 14). By that time, I had received
                            ref B. Unfortunately, Saud had already told him the names were not in
                            the hands of Congress and when I told him they were, he reacted icily. I
                            told him we had the word of Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF_1"
                                >Church</persName> that the names would not be released to the
                            press. He asked if anyone in the United States Government were naive
                            enough to accept Senator <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Church</persName>’s
                            word as binding.</p>
                        <p>3. I told Sultan that there was indeed a real danger that the names would
                            be leaked. I also said that if they were, it would be extraordinarily
                            important for the Saudis not to overreact. There were quite clearly
                            individuals in the United States and elsewhere who would like to exploit
                            this incident to disrupt relations between the two
                            countries—permanently, if possible. But Saudi Arabia must not <gloss
                                target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not fall into <pb facs="0581" n="546"
                                xml:id="pg_546"/> their trap. If they do, only the enemies of the
                            two countries would benefit.</p>
                        <p>4. Prince Sultan listened attentively but made no commitment. He said he
                            had a few questions he would like to ask:</p>
                        <p>A. How is it possible for the State Department to inform him one day that
                            the names had not been given to the Congress and inform him the next day
                            that they had been? Is this not something the State Department has a
                            right to know? Can it not demand this information either from the
                            company or from the Congress?</p>
                        <p>B. Did the State Department make any effort to prohibit the company from
                            giving the names to the Congress? He assumed not and if not, then why
                            not?</p>
                        <p>C. Why is the State Department not able to get copies of the documents
                            from Lockheed before they are released to the press? Prince Saud will
                            ask for these documents when he is in the States, and he trusts they
                            will be available to him at that time. Perhaps, the Prince said, the
                            Saudis should go to Lockheed directly. If Lockheed wishes to have any
                            future in the country it will surely give them the documents.</p>
                        <p>D. Does the United States recognize the consequences of the release of
                            such things to the press? Has it been made clear to the State Department
                            the strength of the feelings of Saudi Government on this matter? (The
                            other questions may have been only rhetorical and I did not answer. I
                            told him I could answer this one, however: the feelings of the Saudi
                            Government, as expressed by Princes Sultan and Saud, had been reported
                            fully.)</p>
                        <p>E. Is this part of the new “hard line” toward Saudi Arabia? Is the United
                            States Government trying to humiliate the Saudi Government? If so, the
                            reaction in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere would be highly negative. (I told
                            him I was sure it was not: The administration itself would be highly
                            embarrassed if the names are leaked to the press.)</p>
                        <p>5. Prince Sultan said that he had just talked with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Adnan Khashoggi</persName> and had asked him if he
                            had at any time ever mentioned to any company representative the names
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>].
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> replied that he
                            would swear on the holy Koran that he had not. He had, however, arranged
                            for the company to pay $2 million to former Air Force General Hashem and
                            $5 million to [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>6. Prince Sultan said he wanted a commitment from <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Adnan Khashoggi</persName> that within the next
                            three days he would break all relations with the three companies,
                            foregoing all commissions. Prince Sultan said that he expected to have
                            evidence within the next day from <persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName> that he had done this.</p>
                        <p>7. Comment: The agents’ commission problem seems to have been solved if
                            ref C and paragraph 5 of this cable are actually put into effect. <pb
                                facs="0582" n="547" xml:id="pg_547"/> I urgently request that this
                            information not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not be passed to
                            any of the companies involved; it will be public knowledge soon enough.
                            Sultan said he wanted both actions (<persName corresp="#p_KA_1"
                                >Khashoggi</persName> relinquishing his agencies and the new Saudi
                            decree) taken before the names of the persons allegedly bribed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> hit the press. It
                            is important, he said, that their actions—which they have considered for
                            a long time—not appear to the public as reactions to the Senate
                            disclosures. I told him we would continue to try to keep the names
                            confidential but could guarantee nothing.</p>
                        <p>7. The Saudis will probably react against us for what they consider our
                            failure to protect them from embarrassment and to what they still
                            consider our “new hard line” toward them. Sultan seemed impressed with
                            my argument that they should do nothing to harm our long-term
                            relationship and I hope their reaction will be only to refuse to do some
                            of the less important things we are constantly asking them to do, e.g.
                            help third countries; grant overflights; support our positions in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. And our companies probably will
                            lose the next few big construction projects. If the Saudis limit
                            themselves to this, we’ll have escaped neatly for I cannot overemphasize
                            their current anger.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I am pleased to have the
                            opportunity to meet you. I regret I never met His Majesty King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> and I look forward to meeting

                            relations are extremely important.</p>
                        <p>Let me first clarify a couple of points which may be of concern.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> is one of our
                            very top diplomats. He is going there because we are upgrading our
                            representation there with one of our very best people. It’s for no other
                            reason. Replacing <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Akins</persName> with
                                <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> has no other meaning.
                            We think <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> will be able to
                            upgrade our relations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> I convey the greetings of His Majesty King
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> and I thank you for
                            the opportunity to convey them. We agree on the closeness of our
                            relations. The closeness of our relations is such that if there are any
                            problems, we can discuss them frankly and openly. We hope the intensity
                            of our relations will continue to grow.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> So do we. As you know, we tried
                            very hard to keep the Middle East from stagnating. We think what we have
                            achieved has been in the interest of world peace. I assure you that we
                            will not stop here. This is just a building block towards peace. We will
                            keep working for further steps. We will not back out, but we will be
                            active toward our common goal.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> We put tremendous weight on your efforts,
                            Mr. President. There is anxiety in the Middle East as to where we go
                            from here. Most would accept a step-by-step approach if only they knew
                            where they were taking us. President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> has put his entire faith in you and has taken
                            immense risks for peace—with the other Arabs and with his army. Where is
                            the balance? We see reports from Israel that this is the last move, that
                            the settlers on Golan won’t be moving, etcetera. That also causes
                            concern.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I developed a very fine
                            relationship with President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            at Salzburg. I feel a personal commitment to him to see that this
                            agreement is carried out. I look forward to meeting President Asad. I
                            tried to meet him in August but it didn’t work out. Secretary <persName

                            I look forward to meeting him.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Do you know him?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> Yes. I think he is realistic and truthful in
                            his presentation. Syria has more territory under Israeli occupation
                            since ‘73 than before.</p>

                            agree with His Highness that President Asad is a man of moderation.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> Syria has accepted Resolution 242 as the
                            basis of a settlement, but Israel has not. If peace is to be achieved,
                            it can come only through the exercise of America’s persuasive powers on
                            Israel.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I can assure you we used them to
                            the utmost. And we will continue to do so as we move down the road of
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>I took some personal risk in agreeing to the request from <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and Rabin for American
                            technicians. It helps me if we can have as much support as possible in
                            the Arab world for the agreement. It helps us in continuing our pressure
                            to keep things going. When the Arabs raise questions, it makes it harder
                            for me.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            It is the perception here that we brought pressure on Israel. If, having
                            paid the price with the Jews here, we are attacked by the Arabs abroad,
                            many Americans will think there is no point in engaging. This is the
                            first time we have had movement in peacetime and it sets the path for
                            further steps. I will talk further with you on this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> We don’t see why the people should attack
                            it, because it is like the previous one.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            It is more significant.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> What worries us is the promise of new
                            military equipment and unusual equipment—like the Pershing. When
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was in Saudi
                            Arabia, we considered the agreement a positive step. We continue to hold
                            that view, but we need assurances that Israel looks at it that way. The
                            demand by Israel for equipment indicates they are not seeking peace but
                            more American aid.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> You should know that we qualified
                            the words, and the commitments we made very carefully. I said we
                            promised to study them.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            The F–16 can’t be delivered before 1979. We will study the Pershing very
                            carefully. These things we will hold as a condition for movement. If we
                            have not made a dramatic movement toward peace by 1979, we will be in a
                            very difficult situation. There is no commitment at all on the
                            Pershing.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> Is it true that there is no agreement until

                            economic assistance will come in the annual foreign aid legislation and
                            probably won’t be considered for a month or two.</p>

                            The drafting in Geneva is not finished yet. By the time it is, we hope
                            to have the technicians approved.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> There is one point that Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> wanted to be raised—the
                            Palestinians. Recognition of their rights in peace is important. They
                            have a destabilizing capability now. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned the possibility of
                            contacts with them.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            It would have to be done carefully.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> It would have to be held very
                            closely because it is a sensitive issue in the United States. We

                            talks would be helpful—if it became public, it would make it difficult
                            to make more movement.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> Just one more point that His Majesty asked
                            me to raise—the information on companies which is now coming out in this
                            country. We would like to know what it is coming out. One is the legal
                            aspects of bribery—which should be dealt with in the committees. The
                            commissions that people used is added to the government-to-government
                            price. Our government will take the position that it will not pay these
                            charges.</p>
                        <p>If names get thrown around in these hearings, it would have a very bad

                        <p>THE SECRETARY: (after a 15 minute tete-à-tete). His Highness was just
                            expressing his views that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            should move further along on the question of the Palestinians. I told
                            him about the difficulties this presented for us and the general
                            direction we were prepared to follow.</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: I think it is essential for the Palestinians to come into
                            the picture eventually. It is a most difficult issue but the only way to
                            solve the Middle East problem is to bring the Palestinians into the
                            picture if we stand on the legality of representation. It will do no
                            good to describe the Palestinians as terrorists and the Middle East
                            issue won’t be resolved if their rights are not taken into account. The
                            Arab countries have tackled this issue by accepting the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> as the only representative of the
                            Palestinian people. Dealing with them (the Palestinians) as an entity
                            will make them more constructive and responsible.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I expressed our general view when I spoke to Crown Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> and we will pursue
                            that course. We will not change. It is for us a very delicate and
                            complicated problem. We hope you will understand our problem just as we
                            understand your concerns.</p>
                        <p>In speaking to His Highness about my Cincinnati speech, he mentioned that
                            he had heard that I had referred to an increase in the price <pb
                                facs="0587" n="552" xml:id="pg_552"/> of “Arab oil” as having a
                            serious consequence for the world economy. I did not use the word “Arab
                            oil” and I want to give you the text of my speech (Secretary asks for
                            the text).</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: This is what I understood that you had said. The reference
                            to “Arab oil prices” has become a very common expression in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> press.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: (pointing to the text) Here is what I said, it shows what
                            can happen in the press if they do not quote you correctly. I said “But
                            another oil price rise would severely jeopardize these hopes.”</p>
                        <p>What about our bilateral relations?</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: This morning, with the President, I referred to the
                            publicity given in Congress concerning commission payments and the
                            problem this poses for us. Can anything be done with company
                            documents?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: (to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>)
                            Is there anything we can do about this?</p>
                        <p>MR. ATHERTON: We are trying to work with the committees in Congress by
                            pointing out the adverse political impact if allegations are made
                            regarding foreign officials. I believe it has had some effect but it is
                            limited. We have also been in touch with the companies to point out the
                            foreign policy problem.</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: We would like to have whatever information is available so
                            that we could study it and determine if there have been any illegal
                            activities. In fact, we would welcome any information which the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> uncovers so that we can take
                            appropriate action.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Our government is not investigating alleged illegalities.
                            We are not aware whether any of the activities reported by the companies
                            before the Congressional committees constitute illegal activities. You
                            would be the best judge of this. There are allegations that have emerged
                            at the hearings but we can’t control these hearings.</p>
                        <p>What about military supply? (turning to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName>) I discussed our military program in detail
                            when I was in Taif. Are there any hold-ups?</p>
                        <p>MR. ATHERTON: I am not aware of any.</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: We have prepared a letter listing the items which require
                            action on your part. We expect to deliver it to you shortly.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: (to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>) Is
                            the administrative machinery ready so that we can give attention to
                            these requests?</p>
                        <p>MR. SISCO: Yes.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We would like to have it so that your Ambassador can call
                            attention to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName> or myself
                            when there is bureaucratic confusion over your arms requests. We can
                            generally cut through the red tape.</p>
                        <pb facs="0588" n="553" xml:id="pg_553"/>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: All of our military purchases emanate from our discussions
                            in the Joint Commission. We have indicated the type of armaments we
                            seek. But there have been problems of deliveries and this creates
                            difficulties because these purchases are geared to specific phases in
                            our modernization program.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I have talked to the President about sending Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName> to Saudi Arabia
                            on a visit.</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: As you know, he has a standing invitation to come at any
                            time. Prince Sultan has expressed great interest in his coming.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I am scheduled to see Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName> tomorrow and I will raise
                            it then.</p>
                        <p>How long are you staying in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: Until September 30. I give my speech on the 29th.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Is Baroody still there? Isn’t he the dean in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: Yes, he is a well-known figure in the United Nations. He
                            received one vote this year to be the President of the Assembly as did
                            the representative of Mauritius. Baroody also got a vote last year. Each
                            year he gets at least one vote. He is a very flamboyant person.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That reminds me of the disastrous experience we had when
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> was President
                            and he met with the President of Mauritius who had come for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. A briefing memorandum had been prepared
                            but for Mauritania, not Mauritius (laughter). President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> took pride in not speaking from
                            notes and he would memorize the points in the briefing paper. Once he
                            got started for this meeting, however, there was no way of stopping him
                            (laughter). The President talked about the trend toward re-establishing
                            relations and our welcoming relations with Moslem countries. It was a
                            good briefing paper for Mauritania but the President’s dialogue bore no
                            relation to Mauritius and it was shattering (laughter).</p>
                        <p>This reminds me of another story. At the time of the oil embargo, I am
                            told Baroody came to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> riding on a
                            donkey in order not to waste energy (laughter). I know that the
                            Presidency (of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss>) is scheduled
                            to go to the Middle East next year and perhaps Baroody will get it.</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: I know that Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam is campaigning
                            hard for this job.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I like Khaddam. I like the Syrians. When they are
                            convinced something must be done, they act.</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: The Syrians feel very strongly about getting movement on
                            their front. The Syrians need an assurance that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> will <pb facs="0589" n="554"
                                xml:id="pg_554"/> act. They are convinced that a commitment by the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> to act is very important.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I can’t complain about the conduct of the Syrians and of
                            President Asad, whom I like very much, and of Foreign Minister Khaddam.
                            Events have moved more slowly for the Syrians than I would have hoped. I
                            have always told them what my views were, so what I said to President
                            Asad, that I would stick by my word, is absolutely true.</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: I appreciate this assurance. I want to thank you for your
                            many courtesies.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY I expect I will be seeing you in New York.</p>
                        <p>PRINCE SAUD: Yes, I hope so.</p>

                        <p>Summary: We have detected no air of crisis in Saudi-<gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> relations here in the Kingdom but a
                            crisis is a virtual certainty if a large scale arms agreement is
                            concluded between the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> and the
                            Soviet Union. The <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> will react
                            strongly and negatively. Saudi (and thus <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>) interests in the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>
                            will suffer but the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> will be the big
                            loser. The Saudis can be counted on to cut off their very extensive
                            economic subsidies and impede the flow of remittances. Some of their
                            largesse will doubtless be diverted to “alternate power centers” since
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> will have discredited
                            himself in Saudi eyes. In the process we suspect he will also have
                            undercut what support now exists within the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss>
                            <pb facs="0590" n="555" xml:id="pg_555"/> for progress, centralization
                            and modernization in the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>. We should
                            continue our efforts with the Saudis to encourage tangible support for
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName>. The Saudis will have
                            no interest, however, in competing with the Soviets for <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName>’s affections. In view of the
                            almost certain damage to Saudi-<gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>
                            relations and the negative impact on <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> interests, we believe that we again would be justified
                            in making very strong representations to <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1"
                                >Hamdi</persName> against conclusion of an arms deal with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. As we have reported (ref A), there has not been any air of crisis in
                            the past several weeks within Saudi Arabia over the state of
                            Saudi-Yemeni relations. On the contrary, things have seemed to be
                            proceeding in an unusually satisfactory direction though at a slower
                            than desired pace. If, however, the information in ref B is true (even
                            though it raises more questions than it answers), we can understand the
                            air of crisis being generated in Sana’a by <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1"
                                >Hamdi</persName>’s inner circle. And if an arms deal of the
                            magnitude suggested is concluded, there will indeed be a crisis in
                            Saudi-Yemeni relations—a crisis of very major proportions.</p>
                        <p>2. We agree that what is needed before we take any action is more hard
                            information. We have been hampered locally in this by the absence of
                            those most intimately connected with Yemeni affairs—which itself
                            reflects Saudi relaxation in regard to their relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>. Minister of Defence Prince Sultan is
                            vacationing in Geneva after the <persName corresp="#p_GA_1"
                                >Ghashmi</persName> visit and his own official visit to France. He
                            is not scheduled back for another ten days or two weeks. Foreign
                            Minister Prince Saud has been in Oman for the last two days. We have
                            left word that the Ambassador wants to meet with him as soon as possible
                            in Jidda, Riyadh or elsewhere. A meeting has now been set for tomorrow,
                            Nov 18. We have had a request in for an appointment with Crown Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> who has himself been
                            extremely busy traveling. But in the absence of Saud and Sultan, we are
                            reluctant to press for an urgent meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>. He would not understand the
                            need for an urgent meeting simply to review the <persName
                                corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName> visit, and if we were to tell
                            him of the pressure of Russian arms offers a very negative atmosphere
                            would quickly build up on the Saudi side (See below). [<hi rend="italic"

                            <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> whose recent visit to
                            the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> was the ostensible cause of the
                            crisis in <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> governing circles. At the
                            working level our information gathering attempts have elicited nothing
                            to suggest a budding crisis. On Nov 16, Colonel Dhahiry, the Ministry of
                            Defense Action Officer for the Yemen told our Pol/Mil Officer he
                            believed matters were going well and that the arms assistance program
                            for the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> is now with the Cabinet. We
                            have gotten nothing from the Foreign Ministry but that doesn’t mean
                            anything.</p>
                        <p>3. By now the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> will have received the
                            reports from its military attaché in Sana’a on the high-powered <gloss

                            for more information. If what they hear seems to them to indicate that
                            the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> was hammering out an extensive
                            arms deal with the Soviets at the time <persName corresp="#p_GA_1"
                                >Ghashmi</persName> was in Riyadh and <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1"
                                >Hamdi</persName> was making reassuring noises to Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_TBAS_1">Turki</persName> in Sana’a, we think the Saudis
                            may react strongly. Certainly their first reaction will not <gloss
                                target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not be to make a nonciliatory gesture
                            towards <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> or to make any
                            dramatic and far-reaching commitments in the military or economic
                            sweepstakes.</p>
                        <p>4. We will hold off on detailed recommendations for action until we have
                            more facts, but in the meantime believe there are a number of
                            considerations which should be borne in mind. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> turn to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for arms on a very large scale as
                            suggested, Saudi interests in the Yemen (and hence our own) will suffer
                            a serious setback. The big loser, however, will certainly be the <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>. We doubt that the Soviets would be
                            willing to contribute a fraction of the amount in economic assistance
                            that the Saudis have been paying out to the <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> in budget support (i.e. $700 million/year). These
                            funds would certainly stop flowing almost immediately to the central
                            government; we would not be surprised if a very large amount of that
                            money was then diverted to what the Saudis perceived as alternative
                            power centers. The Saudis cannot, over the short run, do without the
                            million or so workers now living in Saudi Arabia but they can quite
                            easily cut back if not cut off the flow of remittances to the <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>. This must exceed $500 million/year
                            and we assume its loss would compound the financial difficulties of the
                                <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1"
                                >Hamdi</persName> himself, of course, would be discredited in Saudi
                            eyes. Whether his progressive and modernizing ideas would also be
                            discredited is another question but we suspect they would. For lack of a
                            better alternative the Saudis would probably in any case give more
                            support to the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>’s conservative
                            traditional leaders.</p>
                        <p>5. We agree that it is important to try and maintain Saudi support for
                            the Hamdi regime, and will continue to press this view on Saudi leaders.
                            This summer we recommended—when it seemed as if President <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> might have concluded an arms
                            deal with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>—that “the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would be justified in urging President
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> to unmake such
                            decision because of the harmful effect they would have on our security
                            interests in Saudi Arabia and the peninsula, and on Saudi-Yemeni
                            relations.” (Jidda 4832). Perhaps it is again time for such a
                            representation to be made.</p>
                        <p>6. It would be regrettable if the <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1"
                                >Hamdi</persName> regime considered—because of our sympathy and
                            concern for the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>’s economic and
                            political development—that we are able to move the Saudis rapidly in the
                            direction the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> desires. We think of
                                <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName>’s adjuration “do your
                            part with the Saudis” (Sana’a 3192). Under the influence of such a
                            belief, <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> could overplay his
                            hand and endanger Saudi-Yemeni cooperation and <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                            would warn against becoming too linked to Syria at risk to Jordan’s

                            to moderate <pb facs="0593" n="558" xml:id="pg_558"/> its policies. But
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said he is aware the
                            executive branch is in a weakened position to cope with anti-Arab
                            elements in the Congress and elsewhere. He pleaded that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> refrain from taking further actions
                            that would publicly embarrass Saudi Arabia, saying he is prepared work
                            with <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> and other Arab governments to
                            modify boycott and visa practices but can only do this if there is
                            period of calm out of the public glare. He agreed that if <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> were to react intemperately to recent
                            moves in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>, it would [garble] be
                            helpful anti-Arab elements to achieve their goal. The tone of <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s discussion was more one of
                            appeal than recrimination. Had the news from Washington been less
                            uniformly bad (other than our decisions on military supply, which were
                            helpful), he might have come on stronger. But as it was he may have felt
                            there was little point in shouting into the wind. <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> anti-discrimination measures may
                            embarrass <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s political
                            position. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> would welcome Ambassador <persName

                        <p>3. Meeting with King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> and
                            Crown Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>: Saturday
                            afternoon, December 20, I met with King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName> and Crown Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>. I conveyed to each of them the personal best
                            wishes of President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and
                            yourself. I told them that after your Paris talks you asked that I
                            proceed to Saudi Arabia to review with Saudi leaders latest <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> thinking re Middle East and to
                            reassure them about position on various matters of greater bilateral
                            concern. I noted that I was visiting other countries in the area as
                            well, but that you regarded my visit to Saudi Arabia as the most
                            important. I stressed to both of them that we were determined to
                            continue to work for progress toward a Middle East peace settlement.
                            King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> seemed to agree
                            with all I said. I told him I appreciated his receiving me, and would
                            pass on to you and to President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName> whatever advice I should receive from his
                            Ministers. On the basis of talking points you approved, I reviewed with
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> in considerable
                            detail our views toward the Palestinian question and the January meeting
                            of the Security Council, and the paramount need for the United States
                            and its Arab friends to work together in a spirit of mutual
                            understanding—notwithstanding the strains and pressures under which
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> relations with the Arab world
                            and Saudi Arabia from time to time were subjected. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> himself spoke copiously on these
                            topics in the course of a 3½ hour meeting. Summary of what he said
                            follows.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s traditional friendly ties with
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>: <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> asked me to first convey his gratitude to you for
                            sending me to Saudi Arabia. This was a propitious time for a high-level,
                            face-to-face review of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi
                            relations. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> wanted me to
                            know also he would be talking to me not as a <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> Government official, but as a friend without
                            affectation or exaggeration. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> said <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi
                            friendship was of long standing, and he wanted it to remain firm and
                            unshakeable. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> knew over <pb
                                facs="0594" n="559" xml:id="pg_559"/> the years how much Saudi
                            Arabia had suffered for the sake of this friendship, especially in the
                            days of the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s intense and at times
                            violent confrontation with Gamal Abdul Nasser between the years
                            1957–1967. In those days in all the Arab world only Saudi Arabia was
                            willing to stand firmly and publicly by its ties of friendship to the
                            United States. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> contrasted
                            this behaviour with that of other states who secretly protested they
                            were our friends, but whose public record did not bear them out. He
                            reminded me that Saudi Arabia did not recognize any Communist state, and
                            that he did not see any change in this policy as likely. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> knew, moreover, we could always count
                            on Saudi help in efforts to bring about a situation in the Middle East
                            that would give the Communists and the radicals less purchase.</p>
                        <p>5. Zionist and Communist hostility to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Arab friendship: <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> believed that Zionists and Communists saw <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi friendship as dangerous to their
                            aims, and—acting independently and for different reasons—were doing
                            their best to weaken it. For obvious reasons, Russia was eager to return
                            to Egypt and other Middle East countries via subversion, provision of
                            military assistance programs or any other way. At all costs, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said, we must try to prevent the
                            reappearance of Communist-led or dominated regimes in the Arab world.
                            For the radicals to make a comeback would be a tragedy for the moderates
                            in the area, for the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>,
                            and—regardless of what Israeli officials might think—a tragedy for
                            Israel, too. Israel was opposed to better <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Arab relations because it knew this could bring closer
                            the day when it would have to relinquish the occupied territories and
                            seek some political ways of resolving its problems with the
                            confrontation states—none of which, <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> stressed, any longer questioned reality of Israel’s
                            existence.</p>
                        <p>6. In this regard, <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> was
                            concerned at <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> statements that Israel
                            could not be indifferent to the massive presence in Saudi Arabia of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military matériel, and that as
                            a result Saudi Arabia may have acquired the characteristics of a
                            confrontation state. From time to time, moreover, the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> has informed the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> by the Embassy in Jidda of Israeli
                            violation of Saudi airspace near the Strait of Tiran, (King <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> and Prince Sultan also
                            expressed concern to me about increased Israeli militancy towards Saudi
                            Arabia. I urged all of them not to attach too official a character to
                            statements made by individual Israeli politicians.)</p>
                        <p>7. A role for <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> in peace talks:
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> thought it was high
                            time for Israel as well as the United States to tackle problems of
                            peacemaking and especially of the Palestinians in a creative way. In
                            particular, <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> thought the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> ought to give some
                            encouragement to the moderate wing of the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss> which he thought would quickly respond to any American
                            overtures. If we were to do so, the stock of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>’s pro-Communist elements would
                            collapse. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> urged we find
                            some way of overlooking those aspects of the Palestinian position that
                            seem unrec<pb facs="0595" n="560" xml:id="pg_560"/>oncilable with
                            Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. If we could do so, he thought
                            we would see in retrospect how our initiative had paid off. I stressed
                            need for move by <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> toward position on
                            Israel adopted by confrontation states.</p>
                        <p>8. Current strains on <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi
                            friendship: Returning to <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi
                            relations, <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said he knew
                            they were being subjected to hostile pressure and wondered what could
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> do? He knew the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government and especially the
                            executive branch was in a weakened position to cope with anti-Arab
                            elements in the Congress and elsewhere. There were even, he noted, some
                            anti-Arab elements among <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> officials.
                            He said, however, the campaigns in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> against Saudi Arabia were a great embarrassment to
                            Saudi Arabia: after each public affront by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss>, pro-Soviet Arabs would come to the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> as if pleased, and ask how much more
                            humiliation the Saudis were prepared to endure from their American
                            friends. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> affirmed he had
                            opposed such radicals all his life, and as a Saudi official would do his
                            best to continue to stand with <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> But
                            how long could he continue unflinchingly to do so?</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> noted that as a result
                            of his agreement with you of June 1974, <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> economic relations with Saudi Arabia are flourishing,
                            but if <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> banks and private
                            corporations are to put obstacles in the face of this agreement, and if
                            Congress is to attack <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi
                            cooperation, what is the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> to do? The
                                <gloss target="#t_FRB_1">FRB</gloss>’s injunction to member banks,
                            he considered ill-judged, harmful above all to the American economy, and
                            an invitation to our European competitors to displace us in Saudi
                            Arabia’s rich commercial and capital market. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> cited the Arab boycott as
                            another area where public outcry in the United States was making it hard
                            for the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> to modify its position—even
                            though he personally believes the boycott is ineffective and deprives
                            the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> of services of many firms which
                            could be useful to Saudi Arabia’s development.</p>
                        <p>10. On the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s visa policy, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said if this matter had been
                            raised in a private setting a natural solution in the course of things
                            could have been found. But instead the issue had been raised publicly
                            and the radicals are now standing by to attack Saudi Arabia if it shows

                            asked why Saudi Arabia could not inquire about the personal status of
                            visa applicants. Can any state accept such a limitation on its sovereign
                            concern for its security? The United States would not indiscriminately
                            allow Communists or Palestinians to pass its frontiers, and for the same
                            security reasons Saudi Arabia was presently denying entrance to many
                            thousands of Arab Moslems. If the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            is prepared to distinguish among fellow Arabs, “it has the right to do
                            so against anyone else, I guess.” <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> pleaded that the United States refrain from taking
                            deliberate actions that would <pb facs="0596" n="561" xml:id="pg_561"/>
                            embarrass Saudi Arabia. He asked that I convey to you and to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s earnest desire that any points at
                            issue between the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and Saudi Arabia
                            be handled quietly and privately. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> hoped that reason would prevail and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would not subject Saudi Arabia to any
                            more embarrassment before other Arabs and its own people. He agreed,
                            however, with the point that I had made that if the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> were to react in an intemperate way to
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> measures on visas and boycotts,
                            it would play into the hands of elements opposed to good <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi relationships. It would only be
                            helping <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s critics achieve their
                            goal. He seemed disposed to consider ways in which Saudi visa practices
                            could be modified if public pressures on <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> abated.</p>
                        <p>11. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> may be worried
                            about the vehemence and momentum of anti-discriminatory and anti-boycott
                            moves that are being made in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            and which are regarded here as being aimed at Saudi Arabia. Just as such
                            measures can embarrass Saudi Arabia before its radical critics, so can
                            they embarrass Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>
                            before any of his critics in the Council of Ministers. The tone of
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s discussion was more
                            one of appeal than of recrimination. It certainly was more moderate than
                            that which was reported in Jidda <gloss target="#t_reftel_1"
                                >reftel</gloss>. Had the news from Washington been less disturbing
                            to <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>, he might have come on
                            stronger. But, as it was, he may have felt there was little point in
                            shouting into the wind. In terms of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss>-Saudi relations, the Embassy thinks the timing of my
                            visit—as it so happened—was opportune as I was able on the spot to
                            provide the Saudis with reassuring attention at a time when they must
                            have needed it.</p>

                            conclusion of my discussion, Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> thanked me for the news I had brought him of

                            January. He was pleased by my assurances that the great importance the
                            United States attached to its relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
                            would in no way be diminished. In fact the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss>-Saudi bond could only increase in importance with the

                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said he was looking
                            forward to meeting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1"
                                >Porter</persName> and would receive him in the same frank, friendly

                        <p>1. On Saturday, December 20, Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> met with Minister of Defense
                            Sultan to discuss US-Saudi military supply relationship and other
                            matters. (These are being reported via <gloss target="#t_septel_1"
                                >septel</gloss>.) Meeting lasted two hours and forty-five minutes.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> was accompanied by
                            Chargé <persName corresp="#p_HH_1">Hume Horan</persName>, <gloss
                                target="#t_CHUSMTM_1">CHUSMTM</gloss> Brigadier General <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJH_1">Ahmann</persName>, Mr. Joseph Hoenig of <gloss
                                target="#t_DSAA_1">DSAA</gloss>, and Pol/Mil Officer Jesse
                            Lewis.</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> began by saying
                            that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            particularly had asked him to review with Prince Sultan in detail status
                            of our military supply and training programs. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said that Prince Sultan would
                            recall that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            had conveyed a number of decisions on these matters to Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> and himself while in Taif in
                            early September. Since then the US Government had received the Prince’s
                            letter of September 17 with further requests for shorter delivery times,
                            different quantities, etc. It also seemed to us that in some instances
                            there might have been a degree of differing interpretations as to
                            presentations made during the Secretary’s Taif visit. Sultan asked <pb
                                facs="0598" n="563" xml:id="pg_563"/> if Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> was in fact saying <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was going to change or to amend what
                            had been his clear understanding and that of other Saudi leaders as a
                            result of the Secretary’s discussions in Taif? Sultan pointed to a
                            memorandum before him which he said were his and Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s minutes of the discussion. The
                            Prince said he believed he had conveyed his understanding of that
                            meeting to the American Embassy as well. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> replied that the United
                            States Government, of course, stood by what we had said. There was no
                            change in our policy nor in the offers we had made, but he said it was
                            quite possible, in a discussion of such extensive and complicated issues
                            with Saudi leaders, that some points of variance might afterwards
                            arise.</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> emphasized,
                            however, that an unprecedented effort had been made in Washington by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and Deputy
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> to be
                            responsive not only to Sultan’s request of June 15, but also to Sultan’s
                            additional requests of September 17. He believed the magnitude of our
                            effort would be apparent to Sultan as well as the considerable success
                            we had had in meeting the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s
                            defensive needs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>
                            emphasized, moreover, that as a result of Washington’s intensive and
                            high-level review, a decision had been taken to give special priority to
                            meeting Saudi Arabia’s defensive needs from production lines of
                            uncommitted equipment. In addition, our response to a number of Sultan’s
                            requests could begin promptly. Some requests could be filled in the very
                            next year, and others could begin to be filled in that time as a result
                            of diversion of some initial deliveries from current production or even
                            from US Army stocks. This was true of such top-priority items on
                            Sultan’s lists as Howitzers, APCs, M–60 tanks, and <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> missiles and launchers.</p>
                        <p>4. With Prince Sultan’s agreement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> then spoke about the specific nature of our
                            responses to his requests for sales and accelerated delivery of
                            equipment. (At this time, Sultan called for his own records on military
                            sales cases, and point by point followed Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>’s presentation by reference
                            to his own files.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>
                            told Prince Sultan that additional detail about quantities of equipment
                            and the scheduling of deliveries would be provided after the meeting in
                            the form of a written response from him to the Prince’s letter of
                            September 17. (Text of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName>’s letter is based on guidance previously
                            developed in coordination between State and <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss>. Text is being reported <gloss target="#t_septel_1"
                                >septel</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>5. Sultan made fewer interjections in the course of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>’s presentation than might
                            have been expected.</p>
                        <p>A) M–113 APCs: Sultan was reassured to learn that the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> was to receive the total numbers of
                            armored personnel carrier it had requested (1104) and to learn that the
                            apparent discrepancy between the US offer and Saudi expectations was the
                            result of differences in military <pb facs="0599" n="564"
                                xml:id="pg_564"/> terminology. He appeared satisfied, even pleased,
                            to hear that the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> would have in its
                            possession by mid-1977 no less than a total of forty <gloss
                                target="#t_APC_1">APC</gloss>-type vehicles, counting those on loan
                            with Howitzers.</p>
                        <p>B) M60–A1 tanks: Sultan seemed pleased by our offer to deliver twenty-one
                            tanks from scheduled production in the first and third quarters of 1977.
                            In response to his question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> confirmed these would be of the latest model
                            and equipped with laser equipment—as requested by Prince Sultan.</p>
                        <p>C) <gloss target="#t_LAW_1">LAW</gloss> anti-tank rocket: Sultan was
                            satisfied to learn that the entire order (5000) would be provided to him
                            out of US Army stocks in 1976, if the letter of offer could promptly be
                            signed.</p>
                        <p>D) <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> launchers and missiles: After
                            some discussion and explication, Sultan expressed no objection to the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> response.</p>
                        <p>E) Redeye anti-aircraft missile: Upon being told that problems of test
                            and support equipment did not permit us to deliver Redeye to Sultan
                            until the first quarter of 1978, Sultan asked if just a few missiles and
                            a minimal quantity of test and support equipment could be provided
                            sooner. Sultan said he knew the Redeye was an interim weapon in the US
                            Army and if the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> were not to receive
                            its Redeyes until 1978, the US would be using that missile’s successor
                            and the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> would be farther behind the
                            times in incorporating such a weapon into its armed forces. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said we would look
                            into this question. (Comment: General <persName corresp="#p_AJH_1"
                                >Ahmann</persName> and Mr. Hoenig will discuss this matter with
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> officials in late
                            December.)</p>
                        <p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> concluded his
                            presentation by telling Prince Sultan that letters of offer for the
                            major outstanding items could be prepared promptly if he agreed, and
                            would be submitted to Congress after the end of year recess sometime in
                            mid-January. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was prepared to send a
                            training team to Saudi Arabia in early January to deliver unsigned
                            letter of offer and to brief the Ministry of Defense on the equipment
                            and training necessary for the Saudi Arabian Army successfully to absorb
                            the program this equipment represents.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName> said finally that
                            such a large-scale and rapid modernization of the Saudi Arabian Army
                            would require intensive in-country training and expansion of contractor
                            support. He said that if we are to bring additional personnel into the
                            country an adequate support base and additional housing would have to be
                            established. Prince Sultan broke in with a smile to say, yes, he knew
                            all about housing. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> said it would be necessary also for the Prince
                            to give his early attention to certain outstanding <gloss
                                target="#t_USMTM_1">USMTM</gloss> support cases, Prince Sultan said
                            he would look into the matter promptly. In Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>’s presence he called to his
                            military aide to prepare the support cases in question soon for his
                            consideration.</p>
                        <pb facs="0600" n="565" xml:id="pg_565"/>
                        <p>8. During Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>’s audience
                            the afternoon of December 20 with King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName>, the King remarked he had been informed of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>’s meeting with
                            Prince Sultan and had been told the results were fruitful. (Prince
                            Sultan entered during the audience for a brief, whispered consultation
                            with the King but there was nothing in what the King thereafter said to
                            suggest the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> was disturbed with our
                            presentation.) Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> (Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>’s last appointment
                            during the day) expressed no judgment about the talk with Sultan.</p>
                        <p>9. It is the Embassy’s impression that the height of tension between the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> over military deliveries is behind us.
                            In the near future, our discussions with Sultan may revert back to more
                            or less normal tones of minor acrimony and grievance. It also strikes us
                            that against the background of current anti-boycott and
                            anti-discrimination actions in the US (which are receiving much
                            attention here), Sultan may feel lucky to get what we are offering him.
                            Our offer today may actually look somewhat better than it would have
                            looked one or two months ago.</p>

                        <p>(C) <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName></hi> opened the meeting with a general
                            statement of his conviction that Saudi Arabia was of great importance to
                            the United States. Our two nations share much in common; there is much
                            that we need from Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia has been most helpful
                            as a moderating force for stability. Saudi Arabia is the key to solving
                            many of the horrendous problems of the Middle East, and it is important
                            that our relations run as smoothly as possible. In this regard we are
                            not managing this relationship as well as we could, either in-country or
                            here in Washington. Even internally, within the elements of the US
                            Government, our cooperation and efforts have not been as good as they
                            should be. <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1"
                                    >Porter</persName></hi> agreed and pointed out that with so many
                            people involved this created problems, that clearly there needs to be
                            one individual in charge. He assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName> that there would be no lack of effort to bring
                            all elements together; the issue is too important for petty rivalries.

                                <persName corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName></hi> commented that
                            within <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> we have not done all that
                            can be done to pull things together. For example, in Saudi Arabia there
                            are four or five separate organizations that should be placed under one
                            head, except perhaps for the National Guard program. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName></hi> said
                            he preferred dealing with one senior military commander and initially
                            could see no reason why the National Guard project manager should be
                            excluded. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                    >Clements</persName></hi> agreed that there is a need to
                            consolidate responsibility but suggested the Ambassador wait on the
                                <gloss target="#t_SANG_1">SANG</gloss> issue until he has had six
                            months to look the situation over, but assured him it was his decision
                            and that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> would support him. <hi

                                    >Porter</persName></hi> indicated his main concern would be that
                            we do nothing within the US Government organizationally that would be
                            divisive in our relations with the Saudis.</p>
                        <p>(C) The conversation then shifted to the importance of close personal
                            relations and access to key Saudis. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName></hi> felt we needed the
                            ability to get to Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>
                            more easily to have his candid views on important issues. <hi

                                    >Porter</persName></hi> pointed out that Arabs, by their nature,
                            are reluctant to take positions—particularly on controversial
                            matters—where they might have to reverse themselves later. However, he
                            intended to have ready access to <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> is
                            the key, but the problem is quite complex; we are dealing with a family
                            corporation and we need to be able to tap in where and when needed.</p>

                                    >Porter</persName></hi> said he had assurances from Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> of any assistance
                            required initially. He hoped that if he had to call on the Department of
                            Defense he would receive the same support. Since initial impressions are
                            vital, he had felt it important to arrive in a military aircraft and
                            appreciated <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s assistance.</p>

                        <p>(C) <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName></hi> pointed out that the Saudis were concerned
                            over price increases, delays in deliveries, and problems connected with
                            agent fees, and that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1"
                                >Porter</persName> should expect to have these problems raised with
                            him frequently. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                    >Clements</persName></hi> also pointed out Saudi concern that
                            the US Government had not provided a sense of direction when needed. For
                            example, we had raised the problem of Soviet presence in Somalia;
                            whereupon, the Saudis had asked what they could do, but we had never
                            really followed up. Also, in the program of assistance for Yemen, we had
                            not provided the impetus needed. <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName></hi> said he felt that we
                            should not take issue with the Saudis over minor points. For example, if
                            they strongly desired equipment for Yemen to be delivered first to Saudi
                            Arabia, we should agree. If we have transfer problems with Congress, it
                            is our job to sort that out back here; his job is to build our
                            relationship and to reinforce it.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName></hi> stressed the
                            requirement to urge the Saudis to phase equipment deliveries to training
                            necessary for proper operation and maintenance. <hi rend="italic">Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName></hi> agreed but
                            pointed out that, as Arabs, they will continue to seek early deliveries
                            of hardware whether they can maintain it or not; that our only option is
                            to keep providing maintenance support indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>(S) The subjects of Saudis training Egyptian pilots, and of US
                            intelligence gathering, were discussed in general.</p>

                        <p>1. At earliest opportunity, you should seek an appointment with Prince
                            Sultan and state that you have been instructed to deliver to him
                            following confidential letter from <gloss target="#t_LTG_1">LTG</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName> which seeks <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> guidance regarding Triad’s claim that
                            it is entitled to an agent’s fee for the Peace Hawk V program. You
                            should tell Prince Sultan that once he has had an opportunity to study
                            letter, Embassy will be happy to transmit his response.</p>
                        <p>2. Following is text of letter: Your Royal Highness: The letter of offer
                            and acceptance for the Peace Hawk V program recently was presented to
                            the Saudi Air Force. It includes a clause stating (in effect) that no
                            agent’s fees will be allowed for the Peace Hawk V program unless such
                            agent’s fee/commission has been identified and payment thereof approved
                            in writing by the Government of Saudi Arabia before contract award.
                            There are no funds now included, in the estimated costs shown in the
                            letter of offer, for payment of any agent’s fees for the program.</p>
                        <p>On March 6, 1975, Assistant Secretary of Defense <persName

                            of an agency agreement between the Northrop Corporation and the Triad
                            Financial Establishment. This letter was associated with an earlier
                            proposal for the Peace Hawk V program. Your response dated May 17, 1975,
                            stated your “non-acceptance of any middleman . . . in any arms contract
                            between the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Government
                            of the United States of America.” This was followed by publication of
                            Decree no. 1275 of the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia dated
                            September 17, 1975. Accordingly, the United States Government took
                            appropriate action to comply with its understanding of those
                            desires.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding, the Triad Financial Establishment now has provided its
                            firm view that the Peace Hawk V proposal is not subject to the
                            limitations provided in the Council of Ministers decree, and has
                            requested the Northrop Corporation to make provision for payment <pb
                                facs="0604" n="569" xml:id="pg_569"/> of an agent’s fee to Triad
                            under terms of the agency agreement. The primary basis for this request
                            by Triad is its interpretation of an interview, purportedly given by His
                            Royal Highness Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> bin
                            Abdul Aziz, which was published in the Lebanese newspaper <hi
                                rend="italic">Al Anwar</hi> on November 28, 1975.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, the Northrop Corporation has identified a potential agent’s
                            fee of approximately dols 77 million for the Peace Hawk V program, and
                            we are identifying this fee to you in accordance with paragraph 20 of
                            the terms and conditions appended to the Peace Hawk V letter of offer.
                            The Department of Defense, as the administrator of the program, is not
                            in a position to assess the appropriateness of this fee and requires
                            your guidance.</p>
                        <p>We have re-examined the Council of Ministers decree and note that it
                            mentions only “arms and equipment” contracts. We therefore believe that
                            it is in our mutual best interests to clarify the matter of “services”
                            contracts. We would appreciate it if you will provide the Saudi
                            Government position regarding inclusion of an agent’s fee in contracts
                            awarded for the Peace Hawk V program.</p>

                        <p>We have a long-standing security assistance relationship with Saudi
                            Arabia, dating back to the signing in 1951 of a Mutual Defense <pb
                                facs="0605" n="570" xml:id="pg_570"/> Assistance Agreement which
                            linked the continued leasing of Dhahran Air Base to the provision of
                            American military training and equipment, including a US Military
                            Training Mission (<gloss target="#t_USMTM_1">USMTM</gloss>). In earlier
                            years when the Kingdom’s revenues were inadequate to meet its budget
                            needs, much of our aid was <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> grant
                            aid. In recent years, we have shifted entirely from grant aid to <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> sales as the basis for our
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>The early years of our security assistance relationship were
                            characterized by relatively small shipments of unsophisticated equipment
                            and limited training for Saudi military personnel both in the Kingdom
                            and in US service schools. The first modernization program began in 1965
                            as a joint US–<gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> effort. Reacting to the
                            Egyptian threat that spilled over from the civil war in North Yemen,
                            (where Nasser was supporting one side with Egyptian troops and aircraft)
                            the Saudis sought to acquire a modern air defense system. The British
                            contracted to provide much of the equipment and training, including
                            sophisticated Lightning interceptors and advanced radar and
                            communications systems. The United States participation was limited to
                            sale of training on Hawk missile batteries through a commercial contract
                            with Raytheon Corporation.</p>

                        <p>The security assistance program in Saudi Arabia is presently managed by
                            four separate DoD organizations: the <gloss target="#t_USMTM_1"
                                >USMTM</gloss>, the Corps of Engineers (<gloss target="#t_COE_1"
                                >COE</gloss>), the Saudi Arabian National Guard (<gloss
                                target="#t_SANG_1">SANG</gloss>) Project Manager’s Office, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> Detachment 22. Six other DoD
                            activities provide support to these organizations. The existence of four
                            separate organizations, rather than a single activity, is the result of
                            responses to individual Saudi requests for specialized assistance over a
                            25-year period. Although complex and even redundant from a managerial
                            point of view, the division of labor represented by these various
                            entities reflects to a considerable extent the political balance in the
                            Kingdom [the Army and the National Guard are intentionally maintained as
                            autonomous and counterbalancing military forces]. The Saudis have
                            rejected our suggestions that these various functions be unified,
                            reinforcing the parochial bureaucratic interests and prerogatives
                            acquired over time by organizations such as the <gloss target="#t_COE_1"
                                >COE</gloss> which prefers to run their own show. The four security
                            assistance activities are staffed with more than 500 military and
                            civilian personnel, a strength projected to more than double by
                            September 1977. The DoD personnel strengths will continue growing until
                            the peak is reached about <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1980. The
                            present population of 1,100 DoD contractor employees devoted to the
                            principal <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> programs will nearly
                            double by the end of <gloss target="#t_CY_1">CY</gloss> 1978.</p>

                            Saudi Arabia. Of the 160 there are 77 personnel with assigned duty as

                            the Saudi army in establishing and operating an integrated logistic

                                >SAMP</gloss>). The program was subsequently expanded to include

                            personnel, who perform maintenance and supply operations and train Saudi
                            army personnel. In November 1972 the Saudi Ordnance Corps Program (SOCP)

                        <p>—The Saudi Arabian Army (<gloss target="#t_SAA_1">SAA</gloss>) is not
                            capable of conducting successful combat operations against a modern
                            military force. However, it is capable of conducting limited cross
                            border operations against the states and principalities of the Arabian
                            Peninsula and assisting the National Guard in controlling internal
                            disorders and insurgencies. Army units were deployed to Syria but were
                            not involved in major combat during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. The two
                            primary factors contributing to a poor combat capability are the dearth
                            of trained/trainable manpower, and poor leadership. Other contributing
                            factors are inefficient training system, poor discipline, a rudimentary
                            understanding and practice of modern army logistics which renders the
                            system incapable of sustained combat service support, a centralization
                            of authority which stifles initiative at the unit level, and an
                            over-reliance on foreign country contractual services for maintenance,
                            training, and operational functions. Personnel strength totals 45,000
                            (3,150 officers, 11,250 NCO’s and 30,600 enlisted personnel). Ground
                            combat strength is shown in the following chart:</p>

                        <p>—The Royal Saudi Air Force (<gloss target="#t_RSAF_1">RSAF</gloss>) is a
                            marginally effective military force. Transport aircraft and fighter
                            forces could operate independently of contractor support for no more
                            than two weeks and could conduct only limited combat operations.
                            Limitations include: lack of fully trained pilots, maintenance, and
                            munitions personnel; minimal training in air-ground operations; and lack
                            of experience in conducting joint operations. Fighter forces would
                            probably perform credibly in small engagements with enemy fighter forces
                            because training has centered heavily on air combat maneuvers and
                            intercepts. Personnel strength totals 15,000 (flying—200 pilots
                            (jet—90); nonflying—300 officers, 400 warrants, approximately 4,250
                            enlisted men, 850 civilians, and 9,000 Air Police). The order of battle

                        <p>1. As the February 12 deadline for the signing of the Peace Hawk V
                            letters of offer approaches, one major issue appears to be fuzzy—the
                            question of agent’s fees.</p>
                        <p>2. On January 13, 1975, we delivered a letter from <gloss
                                target="#t_DSAA_1">DSAA</gloss> Director <gloss target="#t_LTG_1"

                                >SAG</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_MinDef_1">MinDef</gloss> Prince Sultan asking for the
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> position “regarding inclusion
                            of an agent’s fee in contracts awarded for the Peace Hawk V Program.”
                            (ref B). As of today (Feb 7) that letter is unanswered. The Saudi
                            position contained in the September 17, 1975, decree by the Council of
                            Ministers, specifically refers to “the supply of arms or related
                            equipment.” It does not specifically deal with maintenance, training and
                            construction services provided in Peace Hawk V. A message from LtGen
                                <persName corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName> to <gloss
                                target="#t_CHUSMTM_1">CHUSMTM</gloss> (ref A) instructs Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJH_1">Ahmann</persName> to proceed with the
                            signing of the letters of offer regardless of whether a response to the
                            letter on agent fees has been received. The message continues, however,
                            quote Sultan must be advised personally that we must receive formal
                            response to my letter before we can guarantee prompt and full
                            implementation of the Peace Hawk V program. Reason for this is the
                            contractual language to be included in <gloss target="#t_USAF_1"
                                >USAF</gloss>-Northrop contract will be conditioned by content of

                        <p>3. Both the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_CHUSMTM_1">CHUSMTM</gloss> have
                            three main concerns. They are:</p>
                        <p>A. Might Northrop’s financial exposure to its agent <persName
                                corresp="#p_KA_1">Khashoggi</persName> be so great (approximately
                            $77 million) as to force Northrop to back out of the deal or face
                            corporate collapse?</p>
                        <p>B. Would the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> then be legally
                            obligated to provide the maintenance, training and construction services
                            called for in Peace Hawk V if Northrop pulls out?</p>
                        <p>C. If the Saudis sign the <gloss target="#t_LOA_1">LOA</gloss>, Sultan is
                            likely to refuse to answer <gloss target="#t_LTG_1">LTG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName>’s letter on the basis that
                            note 19 of the <gloss target="#t_LOA_1">LOA</gloss> (which prohibits any
                            payment of agents’ fees out of Peace Hawk contract price) is sufficient
                            statement of his intent. In this case are <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> and Northrop confident enough of their legal position
                            to proceed with full implementation of Peace Hawk V?</p>
                        <p>4. We have no confidence that Prince Sultan will choose to answer Gen.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName>’s letter prior to the
                            deadline for signing the <gloss target="#t_LOA_1">LOA</gloss>’s. (The
                            question is further complicated because Prince Sultan is off in the
                            desert hunting with the King and only marginally available.) Once the
                                <gloss target="#t_LOA_1">LOA</gloss>’s have been signed we believe
                            that it would be untenable for us then to inform Sultan that we will not
                            implement the <gloss target="#t_LOA_1">LOA</gloss>’s until we have
                            received a response to General <persName corresp="#p_FHM_1"
                                >Fish</persName>’s letter. (<gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>:

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>Saudi foreign policy under King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName> continues to be marked by caution, with
                            compromise at home and conciliation abroad. The Saudis are not given to
                            bold diplomatic initiatives. They rarely act in haste—a notable
                            exception being their proclamation of an embargo on oil sales to the US
                            during the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, an act that heralded their
                            emergence as a major economic power.</p>
                        <p>Saudi Arabia is a small country in terms of population, and its military
                            capability is not impressive. Hence, it prefers to solve its problems by
                            spending money rather than uttering threats; money is its single most
                            effective diplomatic tool and has been handed out for various reasons to
                            its neighbors, North and South Yemen and Iraq; to the front line Arab
                            states facing Israel; to selected third world countries and, in the form
                            of loans, to Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>After the 1973 war, the Saudis threw their weight and economic leverage
                            behind US efforts to arrange a negotiated Arab-Israeli settlement. They
                            have become disillusioned about the likelihood of success, but probably
                            have been unable to come up with an alternative plan of action. They are
                            therefore content to let Egypt take the lead in setting pan-Arab
                            strategy. Egypt’s currently isolated diplomatic position threatens this
                            option, and the Saudis are doing what they can to smooth over inter-Arab
                            differences and restore Egypt’s position.</p>
                        <p>They also worry about their relations with Washington. The Saudis prefer
                            to do business with US companies to obtain goods and services for their
                            ambitious development plans. They are having second thoughts about this
                            preference in view of the legal actions in the US against firms
                            complying with the Arab boycott against Israel. They are also taking a
                            look at their dependence on the US as a source of arms.</p>

                        <p>The 10 months since Faysal’s death have been marked by the emergence of
                            the personal style in foreign policy of Crown Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>, the new top man in Riyadh. He
                            is far less rigid than was Faysal and more willing to take a fresh look
                            at old ties. He is reluctant, however, to move very far ahead of others
                            in the ruling circle, and some initiatives—such as the effort to arrange
                            a reconciliation with Aden—have been hampered by the necessity for a
                            family consensus. In his efforts to steer policy decisions as near to
                            his own views as possible, <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>
                            seems to have found a useful ally in Faysal’s son Saud, who was
                            appointed foreign minister last fall.</p>

                        <p>Not completely surprisingly the question of the Saudi financing of the
                            Hawk missiles has built into a bit of a problem.</p>
                        <p>February 29—the last date on which the letters of offer for the Hawks
                            could be kept open—passed without a Saudi deposit of the required $74
                            million down payment. Rather than cancel the <gloss target="#t_LOA_1"
                                >LOA</gloss>’s <pb facs="0617" n="582" xml:id="pg_582"/> which would
                            require reopening the whole question with the Congress, they have been
                            put in a hold status.</p>
                        <p>The Saudi position is that they agreed to pay $300 million for a 14
                            battery air defense system. They are still willing to give the
                            Jordanians $300 million for an air defense system but they will not pay
                            more. They have in effect suggested to the Jordanians that they scale
                            down the program.</p>
                        <p>The Jordanian response so far has been that they need the coverage that
                            the presently planned 14 batteries would provide—with a price tag of
                            $720 million (or about $600 million without the Vulcan guns)—and that if
                            the Saudis won’t pay for it they will go to the Russians who are eager
                            to provide a full-coverage system for a low price. They might go to the
                            Russians even if the Saudis will not give them the $300 million to buy
                            from that source. The implications of turning to the Russians are
                            obvious.</p>
                        <p>On instructions from the Department to explore Saudi intentions Hume
                            raised the matter with Prince Saud (<persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> was unavailable) who said that the Saudis would be
                            unhappy about the Jordanians going to the Russians but he was equivocal
                            about whether the Saudis would be willing to pay the promised $300
                            million under those circumstances; he said he thought they probably
                            would. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>, [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] stated flatly
                            “no.” The Saudis would not pay. He said he had also told the Jordanians
                            that turning to the Russians would cause the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> to rethink its present policy of regarding Jordan as
                            its “first line of defense.”</p>
                        <p>The matter is now in limbo.</p>
                        <p>King Hussain is now in Australia on the first leg of a three-week world
                            tour at the end of which he will also visit the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> The subject will obviously be discussed with him then.
                            He will probably attempt to put the blame for the current state of
                            affairs on the Saudis. It seems to us that the real blame belongs with
                            the Jordanians’ failure to keep the Saudis informed. The Saudis have
                            reacted in strong negative fashion to being suddenly handed a bill for
                            twice the already enormous amount they were prepared to pay.</p>

                            however, we may want to review them with senior Saudi officials in hope

                        <p>74947. For Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> from
                            the Secretary. Subject: Air Defense System for Jordan. Ref: Jidda 2101,
                            Jidda 2165.</p>
                        <p>1. We long resisted repeated Jordanian requests that we involve ourselves
                            with the Saudis in negotiating the financing of the air defense package
                            for Jordan. After the Saudi dols 300 million decision, we reconsidered
                            the state of play and decided that it was necessary to try to persuade
                            the Saudis to make some additional funds available. In the light of our
                            experience with <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> last
                            summer, we are sure he would reject out of hand the truncated air
                            defense package we could put together for dols 300 million. Lacking the
                            air defense he is determined to get, we think the chances are at least
                            50–50 that he would eventually seek help from the Soviets, with all that
                            this would entail to our position in the Middle East. We think we now
                            have to try for some additional funding from the Saudis because the
                            stakes are so high.</p>
                        <p>2. You of course have to bell the Saudi cat, and we in turn want to go
                            along as far as we can with what you believe are the tactics most
                            promising of success. Quite frankly, however, your recommended course of
                            action (reftels) has two major disadvantages which have to be weighed
                            against the factors you have presented. First, we want to be in a
                            position to present a joint US-Saudi proposal to Jordan, which we intend
                            not to back away from. It would place maximum pressure on <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> to accept, since to reject it
                            would mean rejecting the most carefully considered advice—and the
                            generosity—of his two closest and most reliable supporters. If we are
                            not careful, under your recommended course of action the Saudis will
                            regard our approach to them as a joint US-Jordanian position.</p>
                        <p>3. Second, there is the time problem. The Saudis are notoriously slow in
                            making decisions. There will be a budgetary paroxysm here <pb
                                facs="0620" n="585" xml:id="pg_585"/> at the end of April if a
                            Jordanian-Saudi arrangement is not fully settled by then, and we will be
                            back to square one, in the mid-1975 stage. Someone will have to pay off
                            termination and other contractual costs we have already incurred. If any
                            new deal could be resuscitated later, it would cost more than the
                            package we negotiated in the summer and fall of 1975 and began to
                            contract for last December. We have to move now.</p>
                        <p>4. While it is probably too late for you to secure any Saudi reactions in
                            time for <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>’s talks here
                            on March 30–31, it is imperative that you begin the dialogue with the
                            Saudis as soon as possible, certainly before the King’s arrival here, so
                            that the Saudis will not consider our approach to have been cooked up in
                            talks here with <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. You can adjust your instructions (State 65708) to take account of the
                            fact that we will press <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>
                            in Washington for acceptance of the two-stage concept, and in the
                            process we will attempt to determine the smallest option he could
                            consider. Whatever that option might be will not necessarily be the
                            final answer for us. Our position will depend on the degree of Saudi
                            financial flexibility, and we hope you will do your best to move them
                            into the $500-million range.</p>
                        <p>6. A few final points:</p>
                        <p>(A) We agree with you that, if <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName> turns down an agreed US-Saudi compromise
                            position, we may be in an embarrassing position with the Saudis. We are
                            counting on you to present the case in such a way as to ensure that the
                            Saudis would not later be able to claim that we misled them. We intend
                            to provide full and square explanations—through you—to any and all Saudi
                            questions and suspicions, fully recognizing—as you have pointed out—that
                            there have been a great many misunderstanding already.</p>
                        <p>(B) In your approach, it is important that you not convey impression we
                            are seeking a Saudi financial commitment for the second stage as well as
                            the first, although we of course hope that they will be helpful. Our
                            thinking has been that <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>
                            should try for help on the second stage from some of the Gulf countries
                            before going to the Saudis once again. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1"
                                >FYI</gloss>: It may be that the second stage will have to remain a
                            year or more distant. End <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(C) You are also correct in assuming that the total price of the first
                            stage and a deferred second stage will run a great deal more than dols
                            713 million. How high costs actually would rise is hard to estimate,
                            although fifteen percent per year is a ball-park estimate.</p>

                            <salute>Your Royal Highness:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>Before the departure of His Majesty King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName> bin Abd al-Aziz on his trip to the Gulf States,
                            Your Royal Highness raised with me the question of the Hawk missile air
                            defense system for Jordan. I requested that His Majesty’s government
                            make no final decision on this matter until my government could look
                            further into the question and develop alternative proposals to meet
                            Jordan’s needs for an air defense system. You will recall the initial
                            proposals involved fourteen batteries of Hawk missiles and 100 Vulcan
                            rapid-fire anti-aircraft guns at a cost of over $700 million.</p>
                        <p>My government has now completed a study of this matter and I submit the
                            results for Your Royal Highness’ consideration. I do this in the hope
                            that our two governments might reach agreement on an alternate course of
                            action which we could jointly present to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We have determined that the initial costs of an adequate air defense
                            system for Jordan can be substantially reduced by dividing the air
                            defense package into two stages. The first stage would omit certain
                            command and control equipment; certain logistical support items and
                            facilities; desirable but marginal depot, maintenance and firing range
                            arrangements in Jordan; all but the most essential training; and all but
                            minimal spare parts required for initial operations in Jordan.</p>
                        <p>In addition to eliminating these lower-priority items, we will make an
                            effort to minimize termination or contract interruption costs which have
                            already been incurred. Though considerably reduced in scope, this first
                            stage package would have to be sound militarily. We believe it would
                            have to provide basic but adequate air defense for at least three of the
                            priority areas which King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName> has indicated that he wishes to protect, which
                            are: Amman/Zarqa; the Azraq military complex; Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_HBAT_1">Hassan</persName> Air Force base; and
                            Qatrana.</p>
                        <p>Payment for the first stage package would extend through mid-1978 for
                            hardware and probably longer for software costs such as <pb facs="0622"
                                n="587" xml:id="pg_587"/> training and contractor services. In
                            accordance with the commitment which the Administration has made to the
                            Congress, we would not be able to involve ourselves financially in the
                            first stage; it would have to be financed as originally proposed by
                            Jordan and Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>The second stage of the air defense system can be negotiated and carried
                            out after supplementary financing has been arranged using whatever mix
                            of internal Jordanian resources and external financing may be developed.
                            Although, as indicated above, the US Government will not participate
                            financially in the first stage, we will consider—in consultation with
                            the Congress—using guaranteed credit arrangements in the second stage.
                            We would hope at that time that Your Royal Highness’ government would
                            continue to be helpful in the matter of developing a Jordanian air
                            defense system, but we are not seeking a financial commitment from your
                            government for the second stage. Our present thinking is that King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> should try for help
                            with the second stage from some of the other states of the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>While we believe that the proposed two-stage approach has merit, and
                            deserves your consideration, we wish Your Highness to be fully aware
                            that the combined cost of the first stage and a deferred second stage
                            will be considerably more than the $713 million which has been estimated
                            for a one stage package.</p>
                        <p>Even under the two-stage approach there would have to be a greater Saudi
                            Arabian financial contribution than the $300 million originally commited
                            by your government to this project. How much more would depend upon the
                            option which is chosen. Within the two-stage approach which I have
                            described, we have prepared several options for the first stage as
                            follows:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>A. Fourteen Hawk batteries and 100 Vulcan anti-aircraft guns. The
                                first stage of a project of this size would cost $520.5 million (or
                                $598.6 million if a 15% contingency figure is added for possible
                                inflation and other unforseen needs.)</p>
                            <p>B. Fourteen Hawk batteries and 36 Vulcans would cost $456.5 million
                                (or $525 million with 15% for contingency.)</p>
                            <p>C. Fourteen Hawk batteries with no Vulcans would cost $420.5 million
                                (or $483.6 million with 15% for contingency.)</p>
                            <p>D. Nine Hawk batteries with 36 Vulcans would cost $348.5 million (or
                                $400.8 million with 15% for contingency.)</p>

                        <p>The fourteen batteries which would be provided under the first three
                            options above (A, B, and C) are necessary if adequate missile coverage
                            is to be given to the four areas which King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> has indicated he regards as
                            of priority importance. Additionally, it is the opinion of military
                            experts that Hawk batteries such as those Jordan is interested in
                            acquiring need a sufficient number of air defense weapons such as the
                            Vulcan to achieve the maximum firing advantage of the Hawks. We
                            understand that Jordan does not have anti-aircraft equip<pb facs="0623"
                                n="588" xml:id="pg_588"/>ment which it could substitute for the
                            Vulcans. Options B and C above would therefore be deficient in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>The fourth option above (Nine Hawk batteries, 36 Vulcans) provides a
                            reasonably good mix of Hawks and Vulcans, but the air defense equipment
                            could not be arranged to cover all four of the areas which King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> has told us require
                            protection. Adequate protection, however, could be given to up to three
                            of the four areas of importance to King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName>. Since the Azraq and Qatrana installations will
                            not be completed for at least another two years, one of these could be
                            left for the second stage.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate an early opportunity to discuss with Your Royal
                            Highness the proposals which I have outlined in this letter and look
                            forward to hearing your wishes in this matter, including your comments

                            Defense. Ref: (A) Jidda 2622, (B) Jidda 2643.</p>
                        <p>1. We have such a short time left in which to help arrange a resolution
                            of the Jordanian-Saudi Hawk funding impasse that I have decided to send
                            a message to Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>
                            requesting his early response to the proposals you have previously
                            conveyed to the Saudi Government.</p>
                        <p>2. In delivering the message, you should emphasize to <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> that, based on our recent
                            discussions with <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> and
                            his military advisers, <pb facs="0624" n="589" xml:id="pg_589"/> we are
                            convinced he will consider no alternative other than one that provides
                            Jordan with a minimum of 14 Hawk batteries and 100 Vulcan guns. You
                            should add that we therefore no longer regard any of the other options
                            covered by our earlier proposals as practicable, and that we are now
                            seeking Saudi agreement to finance the dollars 520 million package, from
                            which we have eliminated all lower-priority equipment, training and
                            services in order to cut costs to the absolute minimum. You should
                            indicate that if <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> can agree to
                            finance this austere 14 battery/100 gun system and join with us in
                            conveying this news to King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName>, there is a very good chance that the problem
                            can be overcome and the consequences of Jordan’s turning elsewhere
                            avoided.</p>
                        <p>3. You can assure <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> that
                            there is no way in which the Jordanians can acquire from us the basic
                            equipment they consider necessary at a cost less than 520 million
                            dollars. The figure of approximately 300 million that was occasionally
                            mentioned at the time the sale was being considered last summer covered
                            only the weapons themselves plus some other basic equipment. As he
                            knows, such a highly sophisticated system requires a great deal of
                            additional equipment such as radars, communications, control systems,
                            and so forth in order to be effective. It was this additional equipment
                            which, together with related services, brought the original price to
                            more than 700 million dollars for the full system. You should also point
                            out that, much as we would like to help with financing this sale, all
                            the funds presently available to us for Jordan are fully committed to
                            other high priority Jordanian military purchases. You might also
                            emphasize that <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> military assistance
                            to Jordan since 1967 has been substantial, and we have been seeking
                            totals of dollars 175 million for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 76
                            and dollars 145 million for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 77
                            (grants and credits).</p>
                        <p>4. Begin text:</p>
                        <p>Your Royal Highness:</p>
                        <p>I greatly appreciate our recent exchanges on the difficult situation in
                            Lebanon. I am reassured by the fact that our two governments appear to
                            share a common view of the dangers there. It is in this spirit that I
                            would like to share with you my thoughts about another serious problem
                            of concern to our two countries. This involves the long-run consequences
                            for Jordan, but also for Saudi and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            interests, if Jordan is unable to procure the Hawk/Vulcan air defense
                            system we agreed to last year to sell to it. Your Highness will perhaps
                            recall the major and ultimately successful effort we made to overcome
                            resistance in Congress to this sale, which was strongly opposed by
                            Israel.</p>
                        <p>Our decision to sell this air defense system to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> was based on our belief—which
                            I know you share—that a moderate, stable Jordan is essential if a
                            lasting, durable peace is to be achieved in the <pb facs="0625" n="590"
                                xml:id="pg_590"/> Middle East and if the gains we have made in
                            reducing Soviet influence in the area are to be preserved. Our decision
                            also took into account the fact that Jordan is much weaker than all its
                            neighbors in its ability to withstand attack from the air.</p>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> has told us he
                            deeply appreciates your government’s willingness to provide dollars 300
                            million for the air defense system. We have examined what could be
                            provided for this sum, however, and have concluded that it would
                            purchase a system comprising only six Hawk batteries and approximately
                            36 Vulcan guns. This is significantly less than the 14 Hawk batteries
                            and 100 Vulcan guns which King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName> still considers the absolute minimum weaponry
                            required to protect Jordan’s key population and strategic centers.</p>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> apparently now
                            believes that his only recourse is to seek comparable air defense
                            equipment from the Soviet Union, probably through arrangements with
                            Syria.</p>
                        <p>I am sure you share my concern about the far-reaching impact that such a
                            step by King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> would have
                            on both our countries. For our part, we have cautioned King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> that it would lead to a
                            critical reexamination by the American public and the Congress of our
                            traditional relationship with Jordan. King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName> is acutely conscious of this risk, but must
                            weigh against it the risk of disappointing the expectations of his loyal
                            army.</p>
                        <p>I recognize that the arrangements for financing the purchase of the
                            Hawk/Vulcan system are mainly a matter for consideration between your
                            government and Jordan. Because of our concern about the serious
                            consequences for all of us if such an arrangement does not work out,
                            however, we have developed alternative proposals which Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> has conveyed to you. I
                            hope you will give your most urgent and sympathetic consideration to
                            enabling King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> to
                            purchase an air defense system commensurate with what he regards as the
                            minimum necessary to protect Jordan against attack from the skies.</p>
                        <p>I also hope that you will be able to give me even your initial thoughts
                            as soon as possible. Our problem is that if this matter cannot be
                            resolved by April 30, existing contracts with American suppliers of
                            Jordan’s air defense equipment, which we have extended for the full
                            period permissible under our regulations, will have to be terminated. If
                            the program were to be reinstituted at a later date, the contracts would
                            have to be renegotiated and the total costs would be considerably
                            higher, owing to inflation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1">Porter</persName> will be prepared

                                >Porter</persName>. Ref: Jidda 2878.</p>
                        <p>Following is report of my conversation with Crown Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> on April 20.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> seated me. Anani, Royal
                            Protocol translator, sat on a straight-backed chair in front of the two
                            of us and thus began a conversation which emphasized even more strongly
                            than usual Saudi confidence in the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> looked at my briefcase,
                            smiled and began to speak. He had been informed of the nature of the
                            subject I wished to discuss. He spoke at length about Saudi policy
                            toward the US, which he declared is unchanged and unchangeable despite
                            the machinations of certain people who are opposed to such a friendship.
                            He did not mention Israelis or Zionists. It is clear that this refrain
                            has been carefully orchestrated, so often do I hear it, but I have seen
                            or heard nothing to make me doubt that they mean it.</p>
                        <pb facs="0627" n="592" xml:id="pg_592"/>
                        <p>3. I allowed, in my own thinking, twenty minutes for amenities of this
                            kind, but I needed almost twice that period. He seemed to be testing my
                            patience. He and Anani exchanged glances; <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>’s eyes occasionally reflected amusement, as Anani
                            strung out the translations. I enjoyed this by-play, smiled and
                            acknowledged warmly each of his comments and compliments. Coffee, two
                            sugared teas, and coffee again before the break came. I had waited
                            almost forty minutes before he mentioned the Secretary’s name, which
                            provided the opening I needed. I remarked then, before he could exercise
                            once more his royal prerogative of controlling the conversation, that I
                            had requested the audience in order to convey a message from his friend,
                            and I would like to present it. He smiled, he knew the preliminaries
                            were over. He pulled his robe around him, and Anani sat up straight.
                            They both displayed their readiness for serious discussion.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> urged me to speak. I had
                            followed Knabenshue’s precept: “Don’t hurry them,” he told me one day
                            after he had successfully achieved the protection of several hundred
                            people in Baghdad in 1941, “urinate before you begin, remember they are
                            as anxious as you are, don’t blurt out anything in your eagerness, smile
                            and express appreciation, and when you are ready pick up a word or a
                            name to arrive at discussion of your business.” He and Wadsworth and
                            Murray and Satterthwaite were great teachers, but that was an age when
                            experience was usually revered as more important than mere
                            authority.</p>
                        <p>5. I gave <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> the essence of
                            the Secretary’s message, which was well constituted and for which I
                            thank you. I reminded him of the history of this matter since I took it
                            in hand, omitting mention of our previous evasions and imprecisions
                            concerning prices, and appealing to him on the basis of fundamental US
                            and Saudi Arabian interests. I recited <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName>’s warm expression to the Secretary of
                            appreciation of Saudi generosity, his desire for a US missile system,
                            his dismay at Rifai’s press comments, and stressed Jordan’s need, in our
                            view, for an adequate air defense system.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said resentfully that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>’s statements were
                            similar to Rifai’s. I clarified the matter for him, saying <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> had indicated belief that the
                            project appeared no longer feasible (“blown”), but that Rifai had been
                            more specific in mentioning Saudi shortcomings.</p>
                        <p>7. To my satisfaction, <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> said
                            the Saudis liked and respected <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName> and regretted this difference between them. He
                            then launched into a very harsh denunciation of Rifai. [<hi
                                rend="italic">17 lines not declassified</hi>] He said he would give
                            me a list of Saudi contributions to the Jordanians over the years. “We
                            have been very generous,” he insisted, “but we don’t even know where the
                            money went.”</p>
                        <p>8. I said I really didn’t want his list. I would have to give him ours in
                            return, but the exchange would merely prove that Saudis and we <pb
                                facs="0628" n="593" xml:id="pg_593"/> are even more alike than we
                            realize. (I’m not sure I got the point across, though he laughed.) I
                            said it is not Rifai or <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>
                            who are paramount in our thinking. The Secretary has his eye on the main
                            objective which is and must remain, whatever our difficulties with
                            Rifai, to keep Russian material and military teams out of Jordanian
                            territory. We are thinking of Saudi and American interests, and I
                            repeated our conviction that Jordan has a real need for an adequate air
                            defense. He (<persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>) is known as
                            a man of vision, and I was sure he would see the need for us to do this
                            job together regardless of distractions.</p>
                        <p>9. I then went through the process we would like them to approve, that is
                            phase A (14 Hawk batteries and 100 vulcans), leaving accessories,
                            maintenance service, etc., for phase B where we would take an active
                            role not now possible because of our agreement with Congress. Whatever
                            Rifai’s policy or intentions might be, could we give him or anyone who
                            thinks like him a victory? (<persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> did not like that thought at all.) If he and his
                            Government agree, we would coordinate an approach to <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> on 14 Hawk batteries and 100
                            Vulcans as a first stage and as the Saudi contribution. We would tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> that as his best
                            friends we are convinced that he should accept.</p>
                        <p>10. I went again through our thoughts for the second stage. Then I
                            brought out the Secretary’s line in his recent statement to <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> that if he took steps leading
                            to introduction of Russian material or personnel into Jordan, “it would
                            lead to critical reexamination by the American public and the Congress
                            of our traditional relationship with Jordan.” I read this passage twice.
                            Its impact on him was clearly visible. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> said he [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not
                                declassified</hi>] agreed with us and would take your message to
                            King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> and would give us a
                            reply within a week. I spent the next few minutes impressing him with
                            the fact that time is very short.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> then informed me that
                            Jordan’s Crown Prince is due here on April 26. I said I had become aware
                            of that for the first time today through the morning press. I asked if
                            Rifai would accompany the Crown Prince. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> said he would not repeat not, adding that Shakir
                            and one or two others would be with the Crown Prince. I inquired whether
                            he had in mind to raise the subject of Hawks. He said he did not, but he
                            could if it seemed desirable. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>12. After some discussion, I reminded him of our offer to coordinate an
                            approach to <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>, if <gloss

                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> approved our proposal, and I
                            recommended that the Jordanian Crown Prince not be brought into the
                            matter. It would be less likely to be complicated further, I said, if we
                            and the Saudis make the recommendation for acceptance together or in
                            parallel directly to <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                            >Hussein</persName>.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> then asked if we would
                            be willing to give <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> the
                            idea that it would be advisable to change his Prime Minister. I said I
                                <pb facs="0629" n="594" xml:id="pg_594"/> thought it would be very
                            unwise for us to make such a suggestion at any time and especially in
                            connection with the problem we had been discussing. Such a move could
                            boomerang and harm far more important interests. He agreed, [<hi
                                rend="italic">5½ lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>14. This wound up conversation on Hawks. I then asked his permission to
                            raise the question of Americans incarcerated at Tabuk. He had no
                            objection, so, after giving him the background, I requested him to order
                            their release. They had merely visited Jerusalem and had returned to
                            their jobs in Saudi Arabia. Israeli stamps in their passports may have
                            been the cause of their arrest (they were not). They had not been
                            charged and have been held incommunicado for a week. God help Christian
                            pilgrims, I said. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> assured
                            me he would help them too by ordering their release at once. He asked
                            that they be issued new passports if theirs contain Israeli stamps. He
                            urged this, he said, so that they would not suffer further inconvenience
                            moving around or out of the Kingdom. I thanked him for his helpfulness.
                            I have since learned that he did effect their immediate release. They
                            were in our Chancery in five hours.</p>
                        <p>15. Finally, the Crown Prince asked me to obtain an extension of time for
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> to arrange purchase of certain
                            items for the Defense Ministry. I said I would so recommend, and that is
                            the subject of a separate message which you have received.</p>
                        <p>16. Accompanying me on my departure, he said I need not repeat not ask
                            for appointments, that I should “just come any time.” I said this was a
                            great compliment, but I would use the privilege sparingly. The real
                            compliment came when he said I make him think. He was being polite. I
                            doubt very much that <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd bin Abd
                                al-Aziz</persName> needs anyone to do that.</p>
                        <p>17. I think this represents progress. I have no idea how or whether he
                            will weave the Jordanian Crown Prince’s visit into the fabric, but he is
                            entirely capable of inducing the King and Cabinet to make a gracious and
                            generous gesture on that occasion. We will try to monitor developments
                            and will inform you of anything of significance. In any case, I will
                            contact him again as soon as one week has passed. Meanwhile, the less
                            said in Jordan the better.</p>

                            I received more telephone calls from <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                                >MFA</gloss> asking if I would go to airport to greet Crown Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_HBAT_1">Hassan</persName> as he departed from
                            Jidda and “have a few words with him while I passed through the line.” I
                            replied in both cases that it would not be suitable for me to say to him
                            in a line of well-wishers what I had on my mind, and that I needed a
                            private appointment of at least fifteen minutes duration. Apparently the
                                <gloss target="#t_FonOff_1">FonOff</gloss> was in direct
                            communication with Prince Saud. Finally, Protocol Chief Sonbol
                            telephoned and said that they had arranged an appointment with the Crown
                            Prince at the residence of the Governor of Mecca here in Jidda for three
                            o’clock and they would be waiting for me there. I accepted.</p>
                        <p>2. I was ushered into a private room where I was soon joined by Crown
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_HBAT_1">Hassan</persName>. You are well
                            aware of his attractive physical appearance and his polite manner of
                            expression. I said I wished I had met him before, and I told him of my
                            trips from Jerusalem to Amman to visit his grandfather a few years ago.
                            As it was already three o’clock, the scheduled time for his departure
                            for Medina, I took up with him the matter which I said I know must have
                            arisen during his conversations with Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> and others in the Saudi
                            Government, and that was the matter of the missile defense system for
                            Jordan. I recounted details of our efforts on this subject, and he
                            indicated as I went along his knowledge of this or that aspect of our
                            exchanges with the Saudis and the nature of the difficulties they had
                            described to me. I told him that we consider that these difficulties
                            were of a nature that should and <pb facs="0631" n="596" xml:id="pg_596"
                            /> could be removed. More important than difficulties and distractions,
                            whatever their nature, was the need for him to impress upon his royal
                            brother that ideas we had heard expressed about “turning to the Soviets”
                            would do Jordan irreparable harm if they were implemented.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_HBAT_1">Hassan</persName> began speaking rapidly
                            in a very low voice, in effect reviewing matters since his brother’s
                            trip to Washington from which he had returned to Jordan disappointed
                            because of our lack of clarity on the subject of the missile program. I
                            made him aware of the fact that there were limitations on our ability to
                            speak when his brother was in Washington, just as there are now, because
                            we have not had an answer from the Saudis to certain alternative
                            proposals which we had presented with a view to getting the program
                            started. He indicated awareness of the nature of our proposals and added
                            that his brother the King was averse to a “truncated” program. I
                            commented that there was nothing truncated about it, that our proposals
                            would get the program started, and would eventually over a reasonable
                            period of time see Jordan equipped with an adequate air defense system.
                            I said that we had carried to the Saudis his brother’s assurance of
                            appreciation for their generosity and his desire to have an American
                            missile system for Jordan which would be funded in part by a Saudi
                            contribution. The material initially ordered would not be available
                            until late in 1977 or 1978, and by that time we would have developed our
                            ideas with respect to the second stage, much of which could not be used
                            in any case until the basic equipment was in place. Here again he said
                            his brother did not want vague assurances about a large part of the
                            program, adding that some other formula should be devised.</p>
                        <p>4. I asked what he had said to the Saudis on the general subject of air
                            defense in view of the apparent lack of agreement on the dimensions of
                            the Saudi contribution.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_HBAT_1">Hassan</persName> said he had suggested
                            to Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> that the latter
                            come to Amman to see King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName> with a letter which would state the Saudi
                            commitment to an adequate Jordan defense system in specific terms.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> had replied, according
                            to <persName corresp="#p_HBAT_1">Hassan</persName>, that he would be
                            glad to come, but that he would have nothing to say. It was difficult
                            evoking a clarification of the meaning of <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>’s statement from <persName corresp="#p_HBAT_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>, who can be quite evasive in beautiful English,
                            but I concluded that <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> meant
                            he would have nothing to say until the contradictions contained in the
                            letter from King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>, which
                            arrived three days after my last talk with <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName>, had been satisfactorily explained. I said that
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> would probably find
                            it difficult to go to Amman or anywhere else, in view of the publicity
                            this subject had been given, without a direct Jordanian gesture along
                            the lines the King had authorized us to convey. The King’s oral
                            sentiments expressed to us had unfortunately been adversely affected by
                            the arrival of the letter and by press comment which wounded Saudi
                            sensitivities. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <pb facs="0632" n="597" xml:id="pg_597"/>
                        <p>6. I asked <persName corresp="#p_HBAT_1">Hassan</persName> what kind of
                            formula would suit King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>
                            in view of his objections to a program of “two stages.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_HBAT_1">Hassan</persName> said that he had asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> to assume a moral
                            commitment within a regional framework in which Jordan’s defense
                            requirements would be taken care of. He said <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> agreed to consider this. I asked
                            if some phraseology such as “a continuing program to insure an adequate
                            air defense system for Jordan” would sound better to the King, and he
                            said he thought it would.</p>
                        <p>7. Then he reverted to the need for <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> to come and see the King. I said if this matter
                            were ever arranged, there might well be some kind of meeting somewhere,
                            but of course I could not speak for the Saudis in such matters at all.
                            He said <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> was hoping to see
                            me and would I mention this to him. I said I could mention anything, but
                            it seemed to me that first things should come first, and that the
                            Jordanians should deal with the problems created for the Saudis by the
                            letter they had received and by press comment that seemed to originate
                            from official sources.</p>
                        <p>8. As we were getting nowhere, I again took up the line that it was
                            absolutely urgent to convey to his brother the great harm that would be
                            done to Jordan and to all of us if moves are made which would bring the
                            Soviets and their material into Jordanian territory. He then spoke of
                            the April 30 date which would end everything, and I made it clear that I
                            did not accept that concept, adding that King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> should not think we are going
                            to let go on this one. We will keep at it from every angle in an effort
                            to ward off the damage that would otherwise be done to our relations
                            with Jordan. He then said that we have to bear in mind that the King
                            would go to Syria on May 2 (can you judge significance of that date?). I
                            said it is not the matter of his going there, which is serious, but he
                            should be extremely careful about what he says and does there because of
                            the effect it will have on all of us. This was the end of our
                            exchange.</p>
                        <p>9. I would judge that nothing has been concluded on subject between
                            Saudis and Jordanians. I will see <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> or Saud as soon as possible, probably Monday, and
                            in meantime we will brief Saudis on essence of foregoing.</p>

                        <p>Over the past two and a half years, Saudi Arabia has assumed increasing
                            importance in the Middle East and in the broader international economic
                            and political arena. The fundamental reason is that the Kingdom is rich,
                            and will grow richer; its financial reserves, including invested funds,
                            now total more than $40 billion, and it is accumulating additional
                            foreign exchange at the rate of about $25 billion/year. It also produces
                            about one-fifth of all oil outside the Communist world, oil on which
                            Western Europe and the US will become increasingly dependent over the
                            next decade. Although still reluctant to engage itself forcefully beyond
                            the narrow national interest of protecting the Kingdom’s territorial,
                            political and religious integrity, Saudi Arabia is now in position where
                            it can and sometimes does exert considerable influence in the Middle
                            East (principally through providing or withholding financial support for
                            other Arab Governments) and also on the world scene—by its actions
                            within <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> Councils and on matters
                            broadly affecting the international economy (e.g., the North-South
                            dialogue, world energy and monetary policies, assistance to developing
                            nations).</p>
                        <p>In light of its special importance, I asked my staff to prepare for you a
                            special background paper (Tab A) describing the regional and world roles
                            of Saudi Arabia. The paper treats both political and economic matters
                            and is divided into four sections: the Middle East, <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>, the Less Developed Countries, and
                            the Industrialized Countries. It summarizes the basis for potential
                            Saudi influence, as well as Saudi policy objectives, in each of these
                            areas. The actual performance has generally not matched the potential,
                            in part because of problems in the Saudi leadership.</p>

                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>’s death in 1974 has
                            not altered the fundamentally conservative, western-oriented,
                            anti-Communist perspective of the Saudi leadership. However, its titular
                            head, King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>, is much
                            weaker than <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> and shares
                            authority to varying degrees with other members of the Royal Family
                            (particularly his more able half-brother Crown Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>) and close advisors in a loosely
                            structured collective leadership arrangement. While the essential
                            minimum of cohesiveness needed to govern the Kingdom has been
                            maintained, problems are beginning to develop involving personal
                            friction between powerful members of the Royal Family, divergences of
                            view among them on individual policy issues, and the excessive
                            self-indulgence of certain of them. This weakens the regime and, over
                            time, could weaken the country’s ability to cope with threats to its
                            internal stability and basic policy orientation.</p>
                        <p>The new weaker leadership is presently confronted with two serious
                            challenges: the profound socio-political impact of vast flows of money
                            and foreign personnel into a tradition-oriented Kingdom, and the threat
                            posed by increasing inter-Arab tensions with a resultant upsurge in
                            radical influences working on the Kingdom from without and divisive
                            viewpoints occurring within. These challenges have caused deep concern
                            on the part of the Saudi leaders, a concern augmented by their
                            perception of intensified Soviet efforts to penetrate the Arabian
                            Peninsula/Indian Ocean area, taking advantage of moderate Arab disarray
                            and apparent limitations on the ability of the US to react
                            forcefully.</p>
                        <p>In reaction to the external threat, Saudi Arabia has joined with Kuwait
                            in an attempt to bring about a reconciliation between Egypt and Syria
                            which would strengthen the position of the Arab moderates, thwart the
                            radical challenge led by Libya, Iraq and Algeria and discourage the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. The failure of these efforts
                            thus far to produce significant results may be due to the relative
                            weakness of the post-<persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>
                            regime as well as to the intensity of the mutual alienation between
                            Egypt and Syria. Nevertheless, Saudi efforts to strengthen the Arab
                            moderates will continue. The Saudi leadership is also aware of the
                            Kingdom’s internal problems but apparently considers them less of an
                            immediate danger and much more difficult in terms of agreeing upon a
                            program for their resolution. In dealing with both their external and
                            internal problems, the Saudis are counting heavily upon strong US
                            support.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Saudi-US Relations</p>
                        <p>Saudi-US relations are good, solidly supported by mutual needs and
                            benefits, similar political perspectives and decades of close
                            cooperation. However, the Saudis are currently concerned over some
                            important aspects of their relationship with the US:</p>
                        <pb facs="0635" n="600" xml:id="pg_600"/>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—the general reliability of the US commitment to its friends
                                throughout the world and the uncertain relationship between the
                                Administration and the Congress (with the examples of Vietnam,
                                Turkey, and Angola clearly in mind);</p>
                            <p>—Congressional initiatives on restricting arms transfers and on the
                                Arab Boycott problem which the Saudis fear could undermine the
                                long-standing <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> commitment to
                                Saudi Arabia;</p>
                            <p>—lack of progress in US efforts on the Middle East problem, and
                                particularly on the Palestinian issue.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>It is worth recalling that Saudi Arabia lifted the oil embargo against
                            the United States in 1974 only after the first disengagement agreement
                            between Egypt and Israel and a US commitment to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> to obtain a similar agreement
                            for Syria. Since then our negotiating efforts in the Middle East,
                            including Sinai II, have received strong Saudi support, on the
                            understanding that they will lead to an overall settlement. However,
                            should the United States be unable to restore momentum to the peace
                            process, we can expect a growing coolness in our relations with the
                            Saudis. This would be due to disappointment over what they will perceive
                            as our inability to overcome Israeli opposition and the consequent
                            threat to themselves of a rising tide of Arab radicalism resulting from
                            frustrations over Israeli rigidity and apparent US immobility in the
                            peace process. We must expect that under such circumstances the new
                            Saudi regime will be more inclined to protect itself by accommodation
                            with other Arabs than to standing firmly against radical tendencies,
                            even in isolation, as King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName> used to do.</p>
                        <p>Saudi disappointment with the United States for pressing too hard on the
                            Arab boycott/discrimination problem could also lead to a cooling in
                            relations, but to a lesser degree than would a prolonged stalemate in
                            negotiations. The Saudi reaction would tend to be a restriction of
                            purchases from and investment in the US rather than a more fundamental
                            change in attitude. However, this would tend to reinforce any
                            disappointment caused by our inability to generate progress toward a
                            Middle East settlement.</p>

                        <p>Summary: Ambassador met with Army Commander in Chief <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Bin Shaker</persName> morning July 1 to review
                            details Soviet offer. Soviets agreed provide up to 28 batteries, 100
                            SA–7 (improved) and 60 Shilka ZSU 23–4 DUNS on APCS with delivery over 3
                            years beginning in 1977 for total of 372 million rubles (ie about
                            $430M). King and <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> have
                            restructured Soviet request to 24 batteries of missiles and 72 Shilkas
                            at $517M, with same delivery times. <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1"
                                >Shaker</persName> believes on basis of what Syrians have told him
                            that this “military” price could be reduced 40–50 percent when
                            “political” price finally negotiated. <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1"
                                >Shaker</persName> says King is agonized by his problem and both he
                            and King badly want Western equipment, even though Soviet offer is
                            better militarily because of its high mobility. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. As arranged yesterday with King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName>, I met morning July 1 with Army Chief <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Bin Shaker</persName> to discuss military
                            details of Soviet officer given to Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1"
                                >Bin Shaker</persName>, by way of background, told me that military
                            sessions in Soviet Union were businesslike and very open. He contrasted
                            them to numerous neuralgic sessions he has had with us in “Pentagon
                            basement”. Contrast also was between purely military to military
                            character of his talks and those in US which involved all sorts of
                            unidentified civilians each on his own “crusade”. In first three hour
                            meeting Jordanians presented their wish list (large). <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> said they told Soviets of
                            their justification for air defense, described their target systems and
                            drew on information from Syrians to relate to it their proposed defense
                            equipment from Soviets. Soviets asked pertinent and direct questions.
                            They offered to discuss tanks, helicopters and aircraft which <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> said he wanted to defer until
                            air defense system worked out, as a means of holding them off. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> concluded that Soviets
                            definitely were trying to “entice” Jordanians by putting best foot
                            forward.</p>
                        <pb facs="0637" n="602" xml:id="pg_602"/>
                        <p>2. The following day, the Soviets provided their offer. They agreed to
                            supply 28 air defense missile batteries to Jordan over 3 years beginning
                            in 1977. They offered 9 batteries (Soviets called them battalions) of
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss> 2, 9 of a new and improved
                            version of <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss> 3, and 10 batteries of
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss> [garble—6?]. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> was not clear when I asked him
                            how many launchers were included in each battery (battalion). He did say
                            that total offer was well beyond the US 14 Hawk batteries in numbers and
                            launchers. In addition the Soviets offered 60 ZSU 23–4 guns mounted on
                            an <gloss target="#t_APC_1">APC</gloss> with each system containing a
                            type of radar fire control unit. The total offer included ammunition,
                            training costs and a long line of spare parts. Soviets offered to train
                            Jordanians in <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and did not insist
                            on sending advisors when Jordanians made clear that “Jordan did not
                            operate that way”. Instruction in <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            for Jordanian trainers would be given in Arabic. I asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> for the price tag since I had
                            been given different information by King and Prime Minister Rifai.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> said that the Soviet
                            system as offered would be priced at roubles 372 M, which he assumes is
                            about $430–440M at current exchange rates.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> went on to explain
                            however that figure given to me yesterday by King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> of $517M covered a
                            restructured package in which the Jordanians are interested. Shortly,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> said, he will tell
                            the Soviet Ambassador that he is not interested in the SA–2 which is old
                            and is heavy on manpower. Jordanians want to increase the number of
                                <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss> 3 and <gloss target="#t_SAM_1"
                                >SAM</gloss> 6 batteries and Shilkas to approximately 12 <gloss
                                target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss> 3 and 12 <gloss target="#t_SAM_1"
                                >SAM</gloss> 6 and 72 Shilkas. From the price lists which the
                            Soviets have given Jordanians, <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1"
                                >Shaker</persName> estimates restructured package would cost them in
                            terms of Soviet quoted prices about $517M. They want the new package all
                            in three years as well. (Since Rifai told me that Soviet production
                            schedules were main factor driving the original Soviet offer, the new
                            package would presumably require some shifts in Soviet priorities).</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> did not give me exact
                            delivery schedules but a note in Arabic in his files seemed to indicate
                            that deliveries would be made in the terms of the original offer of 11
                            batteries in 1977, 11 in 1978 and 9 in 1979.</p>
                        <p>5. I asked <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> where he
                            thought Jordan would get the money for this deal. He said that point is
                            primary preoccupation of the King, but that Syrians had said that
                            Soviets would give a 40–50 percent “political” reduction over the
                            military price. I said that still left a lot of money to be paid.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> said that maybe they
                            could get a grace period or some kind of long term loan or help from
                            other Arabs. I asked what Jordan would have to do to get the “political”
                            price. <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> said he did not
                            know, but he was sure that King would not accept anything dangerous to
                            himself or the regime. <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName>
                            again reassured <pb facs="0638" n="603" xml:id="pg_603"/> me that in
                            spite of the military value of Soviet equipment, especially its mobility
                            and low price per unit, he wanted, and he was sure King wanted, to buy
                            Western equipment if any way could be worked out to do so.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> said he was aware of
                            the Shah’s indication to the King that Saudis had promised Iran they
                            would fund $500M for a Western system. He said that somehow he and King
                            did not trust this promise; the Saudis had said the same thing before.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> was fully aware of
                            Saudi complaints to Rifai last month about Jordan’s dealings with Syria.
                            (Iranian Ambassador has just called to tell me that Rifai will be going
                            to Tehran to report to Shah as soon as he can set up an
                            appointment).</p>
                        <p>7. Concerning the equipment itself, I asked <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1"
                                >Shaker</persName> for his evaluation. He noted that he had not seen
                            it, but his experts had been shown it and there was included in the
                            offer a new version of the <gloss target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss> 3 which
                            the Syrians did not have. He also added that the offer included 100 new
                            SA–7’s. He said it was a new version which compared favorably to or was
                            better than the Redeye (which Jordan now has). He also said that his
                            people were shown a new aircraft which the Soviets called the Su–22
                            (Sukhoi 22). His people claimed it was very much like the F–16, built as
                            an air-to-air fighter and ground attack plane with a great deal of
                            sophisticated, computerized equipment. The plane was demonstrated by a
                            Soviet Brigadier General who rolled the plane on take-off just a few
                            feet over the runway.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> said he met with
                            Soviet Air Marshall Kutakhov, another Marshall (ground forces) who was
                            his superior in the Defense Ministry and a Lieutenant General of
                            Engineers. His talks on substance were held in a building called the
                            Engineering Directorate which, he said, is where the Soviet Defense
                            Ministry organizes its foreign sales program.</p>
                        <p>9. I asked <persName corresp="#p_SSZB_1">Shaker</persName> if he felt
                            that he could operate and maintain complex Soviet systems in short
                            period implied by delivery times without any Soviets coming to Jordan.

                            opportunity to exchange views. <hi rend="italic">The Prince</hi> replied
                            by expressing his thanks for the invitation, particularly on the
                            occasion of the Bicentennial celebrations. He added that these
                            celebrations remind him of the great forefathers of our country and the
                            principles they selected as the foundation of our democracy. He hoped
                            Americans would continue to follow and abide by the principles of
                            justice and right.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> added that it is good for our people
                            to celebrate this Bicentennial, as it reminds us of the importance of
                            these principles and is an opportunity to rededicate ourselves. It also
                            pleases us to know so many other nations are celebrating with us, that
                            many foreign guests are visiting the United States this year and, in
                            particular, His Highness. Although he had not yet had an opportunity to
                            visit the Kingdom, the Secretary wanted to assure the Prince that Saudi
                            Arabia has many friends in the United States, in the government and, in
                            particular, within the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <pb facs="0640" n="605" xml:id="pg_605"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Abdallah</hi> responded that he hoped these good
                            relations would increase. He then asked the Secretary whether or not he
                            planned to visit the Kingdom shortly. <hi rend="italic">The
                                Secretary</hi> stated he had hoped to do so, but, because of
                            scheduling problems and meetings with Congress on the defense budget, he
                            had been forced to postpone the trip until later. He added he
                            appreciated the invitation and hoped to visit the Kingdom soon. <hi
                                rend="italic">The Prince</hi> commented that he wanted to be there
                            when the Secretary came.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> mentioned that just that afternoon
                            he had met with the admiral who had been in charge of our force in
                            Bahrain, and that they had discussed the on-again/off-again status of
                            our arrangements with Bahrain. He stated that his feeling about <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> forces stationed in various places
                            around the world is that a desirable relationship has to be based upon
                            the mutual interests shared by both countries. <hi rend="italic">The
                                Secretary</hi> asked the Prince for his views on the continuation or
                            discontinuation of the force.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Abdallah</hi> replied that such issues must be
                            considered in the overall context of the Middle East situation and our
                            relations. He pointed out that, although our countries have excellent
                            relations, the Saudis frequently are placed in an embarrassing position
                            as a result of our friendship. Often, other Arabs accuse them of being
                            lackeys of America, limited to parroting the American line. He observed
                            that this is not true, that there has been a free exchange of ideas, and
                            sometimes we agree but other times we disagree. <hi rend="italic">Prince
                                Abdallah</hi> emphasized the threat of communism to the Middle East.
                            He pointed out that the Arabs no longer speak of throwing the Jews into
                            the sea—that all they ask for is justice and right. However, with each
                            passing day the case becomes more complicated. There is an opportunity
                            now to work towards a solution, and the United States is the key to
                            solving this problem. The Saudis feel they are the only country in the
                            region opposing communism; they were disturbed by the turn of events in
                            Southeast Asia, Pakistan, and Angola.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> observed that Soviet influence in
                            the region has been complicated by their buildup in Somalia and the
                            current Jordanian interest in Soviet missiles. He added, however, that
                            as far as standing alone the United States is firmly anti-communist and
                            dedicated to the principles of freedom.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Abdallah</hi> stated that the Saudis realize
                            this is our policy, but would very much like to see some tangible
                            evidence of our intentions. He felt the American Congress is to blame.
                            He observed that they have even blocked an adequate defense budget.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> stated that there are two important

                            and is determined to see that the United States carries out its

                                rend="italic">second</hi>, that our Congress tends to be fairly
                            responsive to the will of the American people. Their mood is moving
                            toward a recognition of the threat; as an illustration: this is the
                            first time in eight or ten years that the Congress has responded to the
                            defense budget request in a much more supportive way. The views of the
                            American people are shifting. History suggests this is our pattern; the
                            pendulum swings far, but it always returns.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Abdallah</hi> urged that the Department of
                            Defense continue to give a high priority to assisting the Saudi armed
                            forces. He stated that his National Guard program was in good shape, but
                            that the regular army often had to wait a very long time to receive
                            shipment of equipment. He commented that he felt it was important for
                            America to show its support for the Arabs to eliminate any suspicions or
                            rumors among the people. He noted that many Arabs believe that the
                            Americans are behind the tragic events in Lebanon, and that the Saudis
                            are accused of the same because of their very close relations with the
                            United States. He said other Arabs criticize what seems to be Saudi
                            inaction in Lebanon, and attribute it all to American influence.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> noted that rumors are always spread
                            to cause problems. They must be put down by strong leadership. <hi
                                rend="italic">Prince Abdallah</hi> agreed, and added that the
                            Russians and their friends spread these rumors but the Saudis are doing
                            their best to fight them.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName></hi> commented that the very fact that we do
                            work closely with the Saudis and support them is a positive fact which
                            should work to refute the rumors. Others can see the benefits of our
                            close historical relationship that has been built up on a basis of
                            mutual consultation and interest.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Abdallah</hi> said he hopes we can maintain our
                            good relations, but doubts are sowed in cases like military assistance
                            for Egypt—a key country in the region that stands in the face of
                            communism—and yet when they asked for a paltry six transport airplanes,
                            the entire American Congress rose up in protest. <hi rend="italic">The
                                Secretary</hi> observed that although there had been some
                            opposition, the sale was approved. He pointed out that in our country
                            each individual has the right to stand up and give his opinion; that in
                            our Congress there always is debate on both sides; but, in the case of
                            the planes for Egypt, in the end they were approved almost without
                            objection.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prince Abdallah</hi> urged that we continue to support

                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> does, too. He said that
                            this is our intention, plan, and pattern. However, it is unrealistic to
                            expect that in helping another nation there will never be any dissent.
                            However, the majority of the American people will support a sensible
                            policy for the United States. <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi>
                            pointed out that the American people like to feel that what they do in
                            the world is supported by <pb facs="0642" n="607" xml:id="pg_607"/>
                            others; for example, we believe the presence of Middle East Force in
                            Bahrain is to the benefit of America, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the
                            region. <hi rend="italic">Prince Abdallah</hi> observed that was why he
                            had digressed on the importance of American support and the evidence of
                            such support. Many people in the region believe that America will not
                            support them, citing the experience of Pakistan and Angola as examples.
                            The Saudis tend to doubt the usefulness of the Middle East Force,
                            particularly if it is inadequate in size to deal with most situations,
                            or it is not used. Some even claim that American forces such as this one
                            are responsible for coups and insurgencies that occur. <hi rend="italic"
                                >The Prince</hi> acknowledged that these rumors are not true, but
                            are spread by our enemies.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> asked for specific examples of such
                            rumors. <hi rend="italic">Prince Abdallah</hi> recalled that during the
                            Cuban missile crisis the United States took immediate steps to force the
                            withdrawal of the missiles, but in the case of Angola the Cubans were
                            able to send large numbers of military forces there and we seemed unable
                            to do anything about it. This was a surprise and a disappointment to the
                            Saudis.</p>
                        <p>The time available for the meeting ended. As guests were waiting for the
                            reception to begin, <hi rend="italic">the Secretary</hi> thanked Prince
                            Abdallah for this opportunity to exchange views. <hi rend="italic">The
                                Prince</hi> repeated that the free world hopes we will remember the
                            principles on which our nation was founded and not abandon our
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: The following evening at a stag dinner hosted by <gloss
                                target="#t_DepSecDef_1">DepSecDef</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> for Prince Abdallah, the
                            subject of Middle East Force came up again in the conversation. <hi
                                rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName></hi> pointed out that we considered the views
                            of the Saudi Government to be the most important factor; we preferred to
                            continue the force in the area, but would defer to Saudi desires. <hi
                                rend="italic">Prince Abdallah</hi> stated that they prefer the Gulf
                            to remain neutral, but if forced to take a choice between an American or
                            Soviet presence, naturally they prefer the American presence. Bahrain is
                            a sovereign state and in the end it is their decision to make. Whatever
                            Bahrain decides, Saudi Arabia will accept.</p>

                            the halls, I expect a door will be open and there will be an operating
                            table ready. I do not know who the architect was, perhaps there was no

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> We all have to face certain
                            concrete circumstances. Some have occurred on our side but some have
                            occurred on the Arab side. Without a united Arab front, it is very
                            difficult to conduct effective negotiations. Therefore, we have welcomed
                            the efforts of Saudi Arabia to bring Syria and Egypt together. We think
                            that Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, together with Jordan, have the
                            elements needed to achieve a peace in the Middle East.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> The only disagreement we have is
                            that he would like to conduct foreign policy from the Pentagon.
                            (laughter) Your Royal Highness, you mentioned you had some ideas on what
                            the US could do.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> What I want to say is that the US has a
                            great responsibility for achieving a settlement in the Middle East.
                            Because the interests of the US and Saudi Arabia are the same, we must
                            be concerned that the Russians not penetrate into the Middle East. We
                            know that the US does not condone Russian penetration . . .</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> (interrupting) We oppose it.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> . . . but we find ourselves between two
                            groups: one which says that we follow the US in whatever it says and
                            does, another which says that we are in agreement with the US over what
                            is going on in Lebanon. As you know, we are exerting every effort to
                            bring the parties in Lebanon together as well as to bring the Syrians
                            and Egyptians together.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> We are proud when Saudi Arabia says
                            that it agrees with us but we do not believe that Saudi Arabia follows
                            us. You know of the efforts to bring the parties together. We believe
                            the Lebanese civil war must be brought to an end because otherwise there
                            can’t be peace in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> What I have referred to is not spread by
                            us but by the Soviets.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> I know, but what concretely does
                            Your Royal Highness think the US can do?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> Well, as far as we are concerned, we are
                            pressing in every way we can the Syrians, Palestinians, Moslems and
                            Christians in Lebanon.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> Earlier in the Lebanese civil war,
                            the US was accused of colluding with the Egyptians; now we are accused
                            of colluding with the Syrians. This is not true. We will do whatever we
                            can toward a solution. We want all the Arabs to come together, we think
                            that would be the best solution from our point of view, especially for
                            those Arabs who want to keep the communists out of the Middle East.

                            would be a tragedy if Soviet equipment were introduced into Jordan

                            No, but we have had a very detailed report from King <persName

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> The late King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> promised King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> that Saudi Arabia would
                            finance the Hawks which were originally to have cost $300 million. King
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> passed away.
                            However, King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> took upon
                            himself to fulfill any commitments that had been made by King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>. Meanwhile, the prices went
                            up. The Jordanians came to see us. We reaffirmed our earlier promise but
                            the Jordanians said that these funds were not enough and that they would
                            try to secure missiles from the Soviet Union. We told the Jordanians
                            they should not go to Moscow. We would finance missiles purchased either
                            from the US or Western European countries. Subsequently we heard an
                            Anglo-American project was being presented.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> (interrupting) Yes, but King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> did not want
                            it.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName> lately agreed to raise the amount from $300 to
                            $500 million to be paid over a period of ten years on the one condition
                            that missiles be purchased from the US or other friendly nations. But
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> went to Russia
                            without informing us. We advised him that he was playing in matters
                            which really were not in his interest.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> You are right. We think that with
                            the $500 million from Saudi Arabia, we can come very close to meeting
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName>’s requirements.
                            There were a lot of people who were urging us to get <pb facs="0647"
                                n="612" xml:id="pg_612"/> in touch with <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> before he went to Moscow. We
                            did not do so. We did not want to be blackmailed by the Soviet Union. I
                            had the impression that the Kingdom had come to the same conclusion. In
                            any event, we think the decision of His Majesty King <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> to increase the offer to $500
                            million will enable us to make a proposal which we think King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> will now be prepared to
                            accept—(turning to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>)
                            don’t you think so Roy?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>:</hi>
                            Yes, if <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> reduces his
                            requirements a little.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>:</hi>
                            If <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> agrees with our
                            proposal, it will have the advantage that Jordan and Saudi Arabia will
                            have the same standard system. Both systems will be completely
                            interchangeable.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> My personal feeling is that King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> is very dedicated
                            but there are some people around him who influence him in ways that are
                            against his interests. Why should Jordan threaten the US or Saudi Arabia
                            with going to the Russians? After all, it is we who are helping the
                            Jordanians.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> I am glad that we did not send
                            missions and that you did not send missions to Amman when we both heard

                            Soviet Union. I think that if <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"
                                >Hussein</persName> should go ahead with the Soviet deal, it would

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> I agree.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> I think it is a wise decision for

                            with you on the Hawks. A little more move in both directions should
                            permit some acceptable proposal to be worked out. Your Royal Highness,

                            very briefly. It is very important that the US continue its political

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> We are doing this. I do not know if

                            regard to the events in Pakistan, this was largely the fault of Yahya
                            Khan who behaved very foolishly. With regard to the other two events,
                            you are quite right. We have had a very difficult time, it has been a
                            very difficult period for the Executive because of Watergate and the
                            intelligence investigation; but I think that after the elections our
                            Executive authority will reassert itself and gain very much. I agree
                            that we have to act decisively and I think our friends will not be
                            disappointed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> This is what we hope and this is what we
                            are trying to convince other people that the US has been and still is
                            holding loyalty toward its friends. We see what is going on in Somalia.
                            The Soviet Union has the guts to push itself there and gain a position
                            of influence. At one time, the US had such prestige that such Soviet
                            adventures would have been impossible. Look for example what happened in
                            Cuba when Castro deployed the rockets. He removed the rockets two days
                            after the US took decisive action. Yet we see Cubans in Angola.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> As your Ambassador knows very well
                            and can tell you what happened, because of opposition in Congress, we
                            were unable to take the action that we wanted.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> I know this, but this Congress, it is
                            like a disease.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> I think the situation will improve
                            after the elections.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> You see a state is like a person who has
                            prestige, if he is strong and decisive. Once the prestige is lost, then
                            the position of the state is lost.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Secretary:</hi> I believe we will be seeing each
                            other again tomorrow night, and I look forward to continuing our
                            discussion on that occasion.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> We are grateful for the strong
                            position that your government took on oil prices. We think it is the
                            right thing to do in terms of the economic recovery and it’s in the long
                            term interests of both producers and consumers. As I am sure you know,
                            we are doing our utmost to be helpful to the political settlement in
                            Lebanon and we want to move as rapidly as possible to a settlement in

                            brilliantly yesterday by the Secretary of State. The dilemma we are in
                            is that rumors are spreading that we are in collusion. As you are aware,
                            these rumors are spread by the enemies of us both—the Communists.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> Thank you. So far everything is going
                            very well, thanks to the efforts of the Secretary of Defense. I would
                            like to discuss the issues which interest friends. I have discussed them
                            with the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense and would like to
                            give you a summary.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Please do.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> The United States has a great
                            responsibility being the leader of the free world. This responsibility I
                            hope and pray the United States will retain forever, because we as your
                            friends have been embarrassed on many occasions. For example, with
                            Pakistan, Vietnam and Angola. We were told by people to look at the way
                            you abandon your friends. The fact is we have been embarrassed by those
                            accusations by the Arab people. It is known that the United States
                            stands by its friends no matter what the situation is. But this talk was
                            exploited by the Communists. This is my first point.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> In the situation in Vietnam and
                            Angola, I wish we could get across the point it is necessary to
                            differentiate between the President and Congress. I think there is a
                            shift in Congress today, because the American people realize there were
                            mistakes and that we can say to our friends we will stand by them and
                            that Congress will support us in the future.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> I am convinced you want to do many
                            things and are held back by Congress. I wish and pray for your success
                            and for more reasonableness and understanding in the Congress.</p>

                            This will test His Royal Highness’s standing with God.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> I wish you well and so long as what is
                            in your heart is goodness and faith in your country, God will make you
                            succeed. The world needs badly men like you, because this is a crazy
                            world.</p>
                        <p>My second point is the Middle East. I hope your Excellency will win, with
                            God’s will, these elections. So your very action and also the Secretary,
                            my friend <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, can start
                            to move things. We leave these things to your conscience. Your
                            forefathers founded this country on justice. You will not do less.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Let me assure you that after the
                            election we will take action in accordance with the aims and principles

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> That is what we expected. The third
                            point is Egypt and the Sudan. I assure you the stand of <persName

                            aims. We have done all we could and continue to do so. Lately, we have
                            given $700 million. This doesn’t mean they can do away with the
                            assistance of the United States.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> We gave $800 million last year and
                            about $700 this year.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            Plus about $200 in PL–480, so it is close to $1 billion. We are also
                            helping them to get assistance from Western Europe and Japan.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Last week I talked with Prime
                            Minister Miki. He assured me that Japan would double what they gave last
                            year. I was very impressed with President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>. He is a fine leader and we support what he is
                            trying to do internally and otherwise. I also met the President of Sudan
                            recently and was very impressed with him. I was pleased that he was able
                            to put down the eruption. We have many misgivings about Libya.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> The world is full of crazy people.
                            Qaddafi is one of them. We are concerned over Soviet bases in
                            Somalia.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> We share that concern.</p>

                            stand with your friends and against communism. The rule of government is
                            prestige—if prestige disappears, the government is lost.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> We will take a firm stand against
                            the Soviet Union, in the Middle East and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Abdallah:</hi> One more point—Jordan. As I told
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, we kept our
                            promise to Jordan—it was for $300 million. When King <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName> came to power, he kept it.
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> then started to
                            say things against you and us. King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName> decreed that the amount should be increased to
                            $550 million over a period of ten years. So we hope King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> will be a reasonable man and
                            will accept it. If he won’t, we don’t know what more we can do.</p>

                        <p>190450. For Ambassador from the Secretary. Subject: Sidewinders for Saudi
                            Arabia.</p>
                        <p>1. As you know, we have pending for formal submission for Section 36 (B)
                            congressional review, a letter of offer for 2,000 Sidewinder missiles
                            for Saudi Arabia. This issue has become a highly contentious item within
                            and without Congress.</p>
                        <p>2. By way of brief background which you may or may not have, we sold the
                            Saudis 300 Sidewinders in 1974 to support their original F–5 purchases.
                            A total of 100 has been delivered and 200 remain on order. In October
                            1975, the Saudis submitted an additional request which included war
                            reserve inventory and requirements for training through 1981 which
                            totalled 4,468. To respond to the Saudi request, <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> performed an analysis based on same
                            threat as the 1974 <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> survey of Saudi
                            armed forces of two front engagement involving a small and a large state
                            neighboring Saudi Arabia. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> projected
                            a scenario of a simultaneous attack of <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> and Iraq. Study concluded Saudis would need for war
                            reserve, training, and 10 percent maintenance float 2,400 missiles.
                            Saudis accepted methodology used, which is same used by <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> to determine <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> requirements, and amended their request to 2,000 at
                            cost of dollars 57 million. Delivery would begin late in 1978 and
                            continue until early 1980.</p>
                        <p>3. Initial 20-day advance notification of 2,000 Sidewinders was sent to
                            Congress on June 9. Formal 30-day notification, which should have come
                            after June 29 was delayed because of congressional recess. Our intention
                            was to submit formal notification after Congress back in session.
                            Meanwhile, however, details of classified briefings which was <pb
                                facs="0653" n="618" xml:id="pg_618"/> given to Congress during
                            advance notification period leaked. We have been warned to expect
                            resolutions against the sale to be tabled in Senate by Senators
                            Ribicoff, Stone and <persName corresp="#p_CCP_1">Case</persName> and by
                            Congressman Rosenthal in House if administration formally submits sale
                            for congressional review.</p>
                        <p>4. Press has been giving increasing attention to issue. Today’s
                            Associated Press report written by Ken Freed incorrectly alleges that I
                            have ordered a re-evaluation of sale of Sidewinders and that I have
                            changed my mind after some Members of the House and Senate said they
                            would fight the arrangement. Media has also played up danger that Saudis
                            could transfer some of Sidewinders to other Arab nations.</p>
                        <p>5. We have been keeping Saudi Embassy informed in general terms status of
                            request but, particularly since Ambassador Alireza is not here, believe
                            you should now go to Saudis at level you deem most appropriate and
                            review the Sidewinders sale making the following points:</p>
                        <p>—There are elements in Congress and on the outside that want to make
                            trouble. There is also a growing anti-arms sale sentiment in
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>—Congressional objection has not centered on the principle of the sale
                            but on number repeat number of missiles, which some are arguing is
                            excessive.</p>
                        <p>—However, since this is a period just before elections, I am concerned
                            that Sidewinders sale may become a major political issue which will
                            stimulate a great deal of public agitation which would be helpful
                            neither to ourselves nor to the Saudis.</p>
                        <p>—It is not correct, as <gloss target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss> story alleges,
                            that we are re-evaluating this sale, which we negotiated in good faith
                            in spirit of the special relationship between us. We have every
                            intention of fulfilling the transaction. In order to do so, this
                            requires submission of letter of offer for formal thirty-day review by
                            Congress, and the only question is one of timing.</p>
                        <p>—To avoid this becoming a contentious pre-electoral issue, which would
                            only give some elements an opportunity to seek to damage <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi relations, we believe it would
                            be preferable to defer submitting the request to Congress until after
                            November elections. We have also considered as an alternative submitting
                            part of the request now and the balance at a later date, but are
                            concerned that critics of this sale would seize on this to seek to tie
                            our hands for the future. Before we take any action in this matter, we
                            would appreciate receiving Saudi views.</p>

                        <p>5482. Subject: Jordan Air Defense. For the Secretary from Ambassador.
                            Ref: (A) State 196840; (B) Jidda 5438.</p>
                        <p>1. I was summoned today at 1300 to meet with Foreign Minister Prince Saud
                            who immediately began to lament the lack of progress we had been able to
                            make in solving the question of financing of the Jordan air defense
                            package. Since he had raised the subject and since I had been authorized
                            to do so, I broached with him the method of payment proposed <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> A which would regard all Saudi
                            payments for all <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> cases as a single
                            entity, including the Jordanian Hawk purchase. I gave Prince Saud a
                            paper on the subject that I had brought with me to the meeting in the
                            event it seemed appropriate to make the proposal without awaiting the
                            comments on alternative financing suggestions requested <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> B.</p>
                        <p>2. Prince Saud expressed great satisfaction at our proposal, and said
                            that as far as he was concerned this should solve the problem and enable
                            us to conclude the matter. He said, however, that he would have to get
                            the views of others concerned (no doubt <gloss target="#t_MinDef_1"
                                >MinDef</gloss> Prince Sultan). He said that he would be back to me
                            tomorrow with the official <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            response.</p>
                        <p>3. COMMENT: Saud’s reaction was extremely positive. I hope that Prince
                            Sultan will share his enthusiasm. Despite his intentions, it might not
                            be possible for Prince Saud to give me an official response by tomorrow.
                            Sultan is in Abha preparing for the King’s visit to that region and it
                            might therefore take more time than that to get his views.</p>

                        <p>1. You should pass the following message from the President to King
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1">Khalid</persName>:</p>
                        <p>2. Begin text:</p>
                        <p>Quote Your Majesty: I know that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PW_1"
                                >Porter</persName> has mentioned to Your Majesty’s government the
                            intense political pressure which the administration has encountered with
                            regard to the proposed sale to Saudi Arabia of Sidewinder air-to-air
                            missiles and also in connection with the Maverick air-to-ground missile.
                            I want Your Majesty to know that, although demands were made for very
                            steep cuts in both programs, I have decided to submit to the Congress
                            proposals for the sale of 850 Sidewinders and 650 Mavericks at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In reaching my decisions, I gave highest priority to preserving programs
                            that are already under way, rather than deferring some of them because
                            of congressional opposition. I also wanted to make sure that the sale of
                            the Maverick should correspond with the receipt by your government of
                            F–5 aircraft for which this system is designed. Thus, together with the
                            sale of one thousand Maverick missiles already contracted for, the sale
                            of an additional 650 Mavericks would permit delivery of approximately
                            two-thirds of your currently estimated requirement of 2,500 of such
                            missiles at a point in time at which your government will have received
                            two-thirds of the F–5 aircraft that will eventually be capable of
                            delivery of this system. I have made the foregoing clear to the Congress
                            in submitting the proposed sale of Mavericks.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the proposed sale of 850 additional Sidewinder
                            missiles, I felt that this was the minimum number required to meet your
                            government’s training requirements and a modest war reserve stock.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the foregoing proposed sales, I am submitting proposals
                            for the sale of additional equipment for which no reductions are being
                            made. The latter category includes such items as <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> launch<pb facs="0656" n="621"
                                xml:id="pg_621"/>ers and missiles, armored personnel carriers,
                            Vulcan antiaircraft guns, and additional F–5 aircraft, as well as
                            pending construction and National Guard programs.</p>
                        <p>Our proposed sales must lie before the Congress for thirty calendar days
                            and I do not yet know what the final reaction of the Congress to the
                            controversial items will be. Nevertheless, I want to assure Your Majesty
                            that every effort will be made to obtain additional quantities of
                            Sidewinders and Mavericks in the future, consistent with our commitments
                            to Your Majesty’s government.</p>
                        <p>I hope that the actions which I have taken in this election year will
                            meet with your understanding. The close relationship which has been
                            developed between the United States Government and the Kingdom of Saudi
                            Arabia is a matter of historic significance in view of the immense
                            contributions our two nations can jointly make to world peace and
                            prosperity. I remain personally committed to those ties and look forward
                            very much to continued cooperation between our two governments. Unquote.

                        <p>There are many aspects of the US-Saudi relationship which we would hope
                            to discuss. One of the important subjects for us is the matter of
                            improving our armed forces. We are not a warlike country, but the
                            threats in the area compel us to improve our forces. The constant
                            questioning of our efforts by the United States lead to grave questions
                            on the part of the Saudi people. We don’t see why they should be looked
                            on with suspicion. Our efforts are not just in arms, but for schools,
                            hospitals, barracks, etc. What we are asking for is less even than your
                            military experts say is needed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> Let me say we agree completely that
                            you have no aggressive designs and we fully support your defense
                            efforts. The reluctance is not on the part of my Administration. Our
                            cutbacks have been pragmatically designed to get Congressional approval.
                            This is a difficult time for us. I would hope that in January we could
                            move ahead in a better climate here.</p>
                        <p>Last year we spoke of progress in the Middle East. Tragically the
                            Lebanese conflict has intervened. We appreciate the Saudi efforts in the
                            area. We are doing what we can to support Lebanon and the moderate
                            forces and keep Israel restrained. We hope that the inauguration of
                            President Sarkis there will permit some progress which will permit us to
                            move toward an overall settlement in the Middle East. We are committed
                            to a settlement as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>May I say how much we appreciate your helpfulness to Jordan over the
                            matter of Hawks. That was very helpful.</p>
                        <p>Do you think President Sarkis will be able to take over?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> We are hopeful. But the activities of
                            Frangiyah raise questions. The agreement for the Arab League meeting is
                            hopeful. Stopping the fighting is a prerequisite. We are asking the Arab
                            League to bring about an understanding. We think all parties want an
                            agreement. We think the Cairo accords are right and all parties accept
                            them. The problem is to stop the fighting.</p>
                        <p>We are optimistic but we are disturbed at the inclination to use the
                            Lebanese question to delay the momentum to peace. The feeling <pb
                                facs="0658" n="623" xml:id="pg_623"/> has been because of the
                            Lebanese situation there could be no movement. There is danger of
                            deadlock and stalemate in this. We think Lebanon should not be an
                            obstacle.</p>
                        <p>If I could go back to the arms. We have a technical problem. We have a
                            long range plan, that was developed with the aid of the Pentagon. Some
                            of the weapons we ask for now are easy to maneuver but as we get into
                            the future we will have to be able to plan better and have more
                            foreknowledge. They are systems and they can’t be implemented piece by
                            piece. We hope for your understanding for our need to build a defense
                            posture and with your support.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I understand and I fully support
                            your needs. I understand what you say about planning for delivery. We
                            have two problems: one is partly temporary with the Congress at this
                            election period. The other is momentum on the part of Israeli supporters
                            that Saudi Arabia has aggressive designs. They are wrong, but momentum
                            toward peace would reassure that group.</p>
                        <p>If I could speak a moment about oil prices. I greatly appreciate His
                            Majesty’s comments about a price increase. Last year when you were here,
                            we were at the bottom of a recession. We are moving out now, but it is
                            still fragile. The <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> action last
                            summer under your leadership was very far-sighted, but any increase this
                            December or for ’77 would be extremely damaging, not only for the United
                            States, but even more so for our industrial colleagues who are in a much
                            more fragile situation.</p>
                        <p>We plan to discuss this not just with you but also with Iran and
                            Venezuela. It would be disastrous to push the world economy back to the
                            recession of last year. So we hope His Majesty’s views will prevail.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> Thank you, Mr. President. As you know, one
                            of my principal concerns has been the impact on the world economy. His
                            Majesty is just as determined as last summer not to have an increase.
                            But it will be difficult, and it will depend heavily on what you can do
                            with Iran and Venezuela. His Majesty has said at least he will refuse
                            more than a modest increase, and will categorically refuse anything
                            beyond 5 percent. If we can get support from Iran and Venezuela, we can
                            hold to no increase, but without that, it will be extremely
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I appreciate that and we will work
                            on them to the best of our ability.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> Our ability in this regard depends strongly
                            on the overall state of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>-Saudi
                            relations, not only in military supplies but in other things. We need a
                            measure of reciprocity to justify and strengthen our ability to act and
                            to keep our public opinion and the Arab public opinion mollified.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> I am glad you mentioned that. The
                            boycott is another case of our difficulty with Congress. I have said
                            that the actions I took <pb facs="0659" n="624" xml:id="pg_624"/> last
                            year were all that were needed and justified. Unfortunately, we have not
                            been successful in staving off Congressional action. They have added a
                            boycott provision to a major tax bill which is vital to our country and
                            it leaves me with a very difficult problem. Also, in another action,
                            Senator Ribicoff and others are trying to add additional restrictions on
                            the Export Administration Act. We are working very hard to defeat these
                            actions but I don’t know if they will be successful. Then it is a
                            question of veto. The Export Administration Act runs out September 30
                            and we are looking now to see what the legal effects of a veto would be.
                            But I would like His Majesty to know that I am opposed to all this
                            legislation and am doing all I can to avoid more legislation.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> I am not very familiar with this legislation
                            nor do I think I should comment. That is your matter, but it does arouse
                            antagonism and makes business very difficult to transact with your
                            companies. If it is passed at the very time the Boycott Committee is
                            meeting, that will be an added problem. If the boycott injures American
                            companies we will discuss that. Whenever any boycott problem arises we
                            are willing to discuss it.</p>
                        <p>It is not a discrimination problem. It is a political act against Israel.
                            We and the whole Arab world want to build a strong and sound
                            relationship with the United States. We mean that deeply, and I don’t
                            think that is a threat to any other country.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> None of these acts is needed and I
                            will do my best to defeat it. Part of this is an education process, and
                            my Administration will do its best to explain the situation to the
                            American people.</p>
                        <p>Again, I assure you I will do my very best to move to a settlement in the
                            Middle East.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> Those assurances are vital to us, Mr.

                        <p>As we mentioned to you last evening, the proposed <gloss

                            and possibly a similar proposal to sell 850 Sidewinders, is in serious
                            trouble in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. While Roy Atherton,
                            according to all sources, did a superb job testifying in favor of the
                            Saudi sales before the committee yesterday at what appeared a congenial
                            session, the <gloss target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> subsequently went
                            into closed session at which time Senator <persName corresp="#p_HH_2"
                                >Humphrey</persName> apparently proposed Senate disapproval of the
                            Maverick sale (according to some he also opposed the F–16 sale to Iran)
                            if it were not withdrawn by the Executive Branch. He stated (and the
                            press has reported) he would either call or seek a meeting with the
                            President to request withdrawal. Senator <persName corresp="#p_CCP_1"
                                >Case</persName> was strongly supportive of Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_HH_2">Humphrey</persName>’s position. After considerable
                            discussion, however, the committee remained deadlocked and agreed to
                            meet again Friday, presumably in open session, to decide what to do with
                            all the proposed resolutions of disapproval.</p>
                        <p>While it appears safe to assume that most of the LOAs will be permitted
                            to go forward, it is difficult to judge whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_HH_2">Humphrey</persName> can get sufficient votes in
                            the <gloss target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> to report resolutions of
                            disapproval on the Saudi, and perhaps Iranian, cases. He obviously has a
                            greater chance in respect to the Maverick sale, but the two might be
                            paired. It appears the <gloss target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> Staff is
                            exerting additional pressures on Senators <pb facs="0661" n="626"
                                xml:id="pg_626"/> to use this issue as a means of rebuking the
                            Administration for its poor performance on the arms impact control
                            statements and for the veto of the security assistance bill. On the
                            House side, the International Relations Committee is waiting to see what
                            the Senate does and would probably follow its lead in disapproving or
                            approving LOAs.</p>
                        <p>In the event the Senate does bring a resolution of disapproval to the
                            floor, it is clear the fate of the Maverick sale will be decided not on
                            its merits but by politics. There will be considerable pressure by
                            Jewish groups to reject the sale, strengthened by partisan pressure to
                            support the Democratic Party platform and present the President with a
                            major foreign policy defeat on his arms sale policy. (It would be the
                            first time an arms case submitted to Congress was rejected.)</p>
                        <p>A bitter floor fight on arms sales issues will hurt the President
                            domestically but to withdraw any of the LOAs or to have Congress
                            disapprove them after having made a strong defense (including the
                            President’s and Senator Dole’s speeches of last week) would also be seen
                            as a defeat for the Administration and would hurt domestically.
                            Moreover, any further slippage at this time due to Congressional
                            pressure on what we can deliver to Saudi Arabia, coming on top of the
                            commitments the Administration has given and the anti-boycott action by
                            the Congress, will create major difficulties in our relations with this
                            important country. It could impact negatively, inter alia, on our desire
                            to hold down oil prices. Finally, we can expect a more generalized
                            foreign policy fall-out among friendly countries as another instance of
                            what they would see as United States inability to make good on
                            long-standing commitments due to domestic pressures.</p>
                        <p>State, of course, is strongly opposed to any Presidential decision to
                            withdraw LOAs for Saudi Arabia or to reduce further the number of
                            missiles involved.</p>
                        <p>The best possible outcome, of course, is to have any resolution of
                            disapproval die in committee. In our view, the best means to achieve
                            this is for the President to try and convince Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCP_1">Case</persName> to withdraw his opposition to the
                            Saudi sale, coupled with a major Administration effort with other <gloss
                                target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> members to try and persuade them not
                            to approve a resolution of disapproval should <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCP_1">Case</persName> press ahead. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCP_1">Case</persName>’s stand places Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_JJ_1">Javits</persName>, who negotiated and agreed to
                            the reduced sale, in a difficult position vis-à-vis his colleagues and
                            constituents. It also makes it difficult for <persName corresp="#p_HH_2"
                                >Humphrey</persName> not to oppose one or more LOAs. We believe the
                            President is the only person who might be able to prevail upon <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCP_1">Case</persName>. Accordingly, we recommend the
                            President telephone the Senator, if possible prior to the <gloss
                                target="#t_SFRC_1">SFRC</gloss> meeting Friday morning. (There is a
                            slight possibility the committee will be unable to achieve a quorum
                            Friday and will put the issue over until next week.) The President could
                            argue his position on the basis of 1) severe adverse foreign policy <pb
                                facs="0662" n="627" xml:id="pg_627"/> implications of an additional
                            slap in the face to the Saudis or Iranians by Congress, including the
                            potential impact on the Saudi position vis-à-vis oil prices, and on the
                            struggle between moderates and radicals in the Arab world; 2) the
                            broader foreign policy implications of what will appear to be another
                            instance of the US suddenly upsetting a long-standing relationship in
                            the security field with a friendly country; and 3) the difficult
                            position <persName corresp="#p_CCP_1">Case</persName>, as a Republican,
                            is placing the President, who decided to go ahead with the sales after

                            Since Chou En-lai died, they’ve lost the finesse in their foreign
                            policy. If we make agreements with the Soviet Union, they cry
                            appeasement. If we resist the Soviets, as we’re doing in Africa, they
                            try to organize the world against “superpower competition.” They’d like
                            a free ride—like the Israelis. They’d like a constant confrontation
                            between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>

                            Relations between our two countries are really very sound in the long

                            No, you have to be able to count on the constancy of the

                        <p>I’ve said many times—too many times, perhaps—that you’ve played a
                            moderating role. In the Syrian negotiations, I have a feeling the late
                            King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> played a discreet
                            role. He always did more than he promised. He never told us, but we’d
                            always see a Saudi footprint somewhere.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> We’re not embarrassed to be a moderate
                            country. We believe it is in the interest of Saudi Arabia and of the

                        <p>We want to build a larger relationship with the United States, and this
                            is our constant desire. Not just for us, but we want to build a
                            relationship for the United States with all the Arab countries. We think
                            this is for the good of all the Arab countries.</p>
                        <p>We think this should be done. We’d like some reciprocation, of course.
                            I’d like to explain this to the President.</p>

                            There is one problem, and that is the <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"

                            we’re trying to get the peace process going.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> We’re in the forefront of those fighting for

                        <p>It depends on two countries: Venezuela and Iran. If they put on a stiff

                        <p>We hope we can go through with it without any increase, but if they put

                            We don’t have much influence with Venezuela. But we can discuss it with
                            the Shah. It would have a severe impact here on the attitude toward

                            The Shah has fervent views on the subject. I’ve sat through many

                        <p>Our former Ambassador in Saudi Arabia keeps publishing memos saying some
                            of your people thought we wanted Iran to keep the price up. I don’t

                            On the arms issue, I’ve frankly not gotten on top of them. I’ve let
                            these contracts develop without my getting involved. We should prepare
                            Congress a little better.</p>
                        <p>This is an internal problem for us.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> We have a problem with our military.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            We sold 1,000 Mavericks to Saudi Arabia in February.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>:</hi>
                            And they went through Congress.</p>

                            You have to ascribe some of it to the political climate in an election

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> We ascribe <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of it

                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</hi>
                            This works out, because this is the number of Mavericks you need next
                            year. Next year we’ll request the number you need for the F–5E’s you’re
                            getting. It doesn’t make a difference whether you store them here or
                            store them there.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Saud:</hi> But the problem remains, because we don’t
                            know about the status of the contracts.</p>

                            But we’ll prepare the ground better. And the position of the executive
                            will be stronger. For these two years, we’ve had an unelected President,
                            and a Congress that had lost its leadership. When Senator Fulbright was
                            Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, there were
                            responsible decisions. Senator Sparkman is a fine man but not the

                        <p>(C) After an exchange of pleasantries, <hi rend="italic">Prince
                                Sultan</hi> spoke of the long friendship between our two countries
                            since the days of President Roosevelt. As an aside, he added a little
                            dig that no matter what obstacles our friendship faces, such as recent
                            opposition to arms pur<pb facs="0668" n="633" xml:id="pg_633"/>chases in
                            Congress, that the friendship will remain. <hi rend="italic">Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName></hi> stated that
                            we would overcome any obstacles.</p>
                        <p>(C) The conversation then turned to the recent Riyadh Conference. <hi
                                rend="italic">Prince Sultan</hi> noted that many had felt the Arabs
                            could not solve the Lebanese problem themselves; however, it had been
                            done, and with good will, anything could be accomplished. <hi
                                rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName></hi> noted that it was a great step forward and
                            asked how many troops would be involved. <hi rend="italic">Sultan</hi>
                            replied 30,000. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                    >Clements</persName></hi> asked how many Syrians—would there be
                            25,000? <hi rend="italic">Prince Sultan</hi> replied no, much less, but
                            the details had not been decided. They would be decided in the Arab
                            League and it would depend on the abilities of each of the countries who
                            would participate in the force. He noted that Syria had less than 20,000
                            men in Lebanon now, and they had not asked for any specific portion of
                            the force. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                    >Clements</persName></hi> asked if the Saudi Army would
                            participate. <hi rend="italic">Prince Sultan</hi> replied that they had
                            about 1,000 troops in Lebanon and they had no intention to increase the
                            numbers, but they would support the other Arab troops. He pointed out
                            that with the mechanization of the Saudi forces and the training
                            involved, they had had to call back their units from Syria and Jordan,
                            but they would not be pulling back the 1,000 man force in Lebanon.</p>
                        <p>(C) <hi rend="italic">Prince Sultan</hi> said that Libya, Syria, the
                            Sudan, and Saudi Arabia each have 1,000 troops in Lebanon now under the
                            auspices of the Arab League. It would be this force that would be
                            expanded, depending on the decisions in the Arab League, and they would
                            be under the Lebanese President’s command. <hi rend="italic">Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName></hi> asked if
                            there would be any <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> forces in this
                            new Arab Security Force. <hi rend="italic">Prince Sultan</hi> replied
                            that if the Lebanese President asked for Palestinian forces to be
                            involved in some areas such as security within camps, he was sure that
                            it would not be objected to. However, the key is that the solution is an
                            Arab solution, using Arab forces, and while the great powers might have
                            a role to play in the area, and <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                            Government help in general is welcome, that in this situation the key is
                            to have an Arab solution and that the Arab world must care for itself.
                                <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                    >Clements</persName></hi> agreed and expressed Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s appreciation for
                            the role that the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> has played in
                            working toward peace and settlement in the area. Saudi Arabia has been a
                            good friend.</p>
                        <p>(C) <hi rend="italic">Prince Sultan</hi> commented that he knows the
                            Israelis are unhappy with the Riyadh agreement. They fear that the
                            rapprochement between Egypt and Syria will work to their disadvantage,
                            and thus he expects them to maneuver and request more arms in an attempt
                            to work the problem to their advantage. <hi rend="italic">Sultan</hi>
                            noted, for example, the recent statement of General <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>, how under intense pressure in
                            the end he had been forced to apologize, and the President and Secretary
                            of Defense had disclaimed General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1"
                                >Brown</persName>’s statement as not true. <hi rend="italic">Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName></hi>
                            <pb facs="0669" n="634" xml:id="pg_634"/> replied that Prince Sultan
                            would recall that General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>
                            had come to Saudi Arabia with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName> on his last trip, that although he is a good
                            friend of Saudi Arabia, occasionally people get caught in a situation
                            saying too much or sometimes things are taken out of context,
                            particularly during this election “silly” season.</p>
                        <p>(C) <hi rend="italic">Prince Sultan</hi> then said, yes, but what about
                            your comments in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> article in
                            which you said Saudi Arabia does not need an advance fighter? Why did
                            they pick on General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> but
                            did not pick on you? <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                    >Clements</persName></hi> replied that he was somewhat
                            misquoted, what he had said was he suspected that the Saudis would not
                            want to buy the F–15. He did not recommend and still doesn’t; however,
                            if in fact they wanted to buy it, they could. <hi rend="italic">Prince
                                Sultan</hi> replied that they are studying the subject now and will
                            inform the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government of their
                            decision later. He appreciated the opportunity for the briefings that
                            the Air Force had provided on all the aircraft; however, they were not
                            at this time prepared to discuss an advanced fighter. They did have some
                            points they would like to cover such as cost increases, the balance of
                            the missiles that they desired for the F–5, but these points could
                            either be discussed or he could send a memo to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName>. <hi rend="italic">Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName></hi> said a memo
                            would be fine, but perhaps they could cover any urgent points while he
                            was here and that he had two or three things he would like to raise.</p>
                        <p>(C) <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName></hi> said the first is the discussion between
                            the Embassy and the Foreign Ministry on the Memorandum of Understanding.
                            He understood there were some sticky points holding it up; however, he
                            hoped that the support case which would fund the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG_1">MAAG</gloss> could be decoupled from the
                            memorandum and signed. <hi rend="italic">Sultan</hi> replied he would be
                            perfectly willing to do so. As for the memorandum, the Saudi Government
                            and the Embassy could exchange notes. They could agree to all of the new
                            memorandum except paragraph 8 (immunities) and leave that along the same
                            lines as it was in the 1951 agreement, subject to further negotiation at
                            a later date.</p>
                        <p>(C) <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName></hi> raised the issue of Yemen and the training
                            of Yemenis in the English language. We have no objection and agree it is
                            a good idea, but we have to work out a few details. We would do so and
                            get in touch with his staff. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName></hi> noted, however, that
                            we were going to Yemen after we left Saudi Arabia and he would
                            appreciate any comments the Prince wished to make before the visit, as
                            he had never been there before. <hi rend="italic">Prince Sultan</hi>
                            replied that there are many elements still within the Yemeni armed
                            forces capable of stirring up problems and who have a leaning toward the
                            Soviets; thus, it is important to show our support and make prompt
                            deliveries of the equipment. For example, there is a problem with 105mm
                            howitzers, a long four-year delivery time, and the need to get this
                            equipment in <pb facs="0670" n="635" xml:id="pg_635"/> there as soon as
                            possible. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                    >Clements</persName></hi> stated he would look into the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>(C) <hi rend="italic">Prince Sultan</hi> repeated he would send a
                            detailed memo of their points of interest; however, there were several
                            key points he would like to mention then. One was delays in shipment
                            beyond the times that were stated in the Letters of Offer, another was
                            the inflationary cost increases, and the third was the short time that
                            they are given to review new Letters of Offer. They need three months as
                            a minimum for their review, and if that is inadequate they would then
                            like to be able to ask for extension, but that 10 or 20 days was not
                            enough time.</p>
                        <p>(C) <hi rend="italic">Prince Sultan</hi> then raised the issue of
                            laser-guided bombs. He seemed under the impression that they had not
                            been provided any yet. He pointed out that they had been given a Letter
                            of Offer for 1,000, which they had accepted, and that there had been
                            adjustment in quantity between laser-guided bombs and MAVERICKs. <hi
                                rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"
                                >Clements</persName></hi> suggested that they should accept what
                            they have now and we would look into the matter again in the future,
                            after the initial deliveries had been made.</p>
                        <p>(U) At this point, an emissary from Prince <persName corresp="#p_AS_1"
                                >Abdullah</persName> arrived and the meeting broke up so the group

                        <p>8335. For Secretary and Secretary-designate from Ambassador. Subject:
                            Saudi Post-Doha Developments.</p>
                        <p>Believe following from reliable source merits your attention:</p>
                        <p>1. Saudi concern over the effects of present and possible future US
                            anti-boycott legislation has taken on two new dimensions since the Doha
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> meetings and Saudi Arabia’s
                            action to create a two-tier oil pricing system:</p>
                        <pb facs="0671" n="636" xml:id="pg_636"/>
                        <p>A. Crown Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> has
                            expressed grave concern that passage of new anti-boycott legislation, if
                            debated and approved during the critical period when Saudi Arabia is
                            working to undermine the price structure decreed by its eleven <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> rivals, will seriously embarrass
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> in general and Crown Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> in particular. He is
                            under criticism not only from other <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> governments and other Arabs, but from a significant
                            element of the Saudi establishment. We have been reliably informed, for
                            example, that Ministers Mohammad Aba al-Khayl (Finance), Ghazi
                            al-Qusaybi (Industries) and <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Hisham
                                Nazir</persName> (Planning) are strongly opposed to <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>’s decision to use increased oil
                            production as a weapon in support of what they see as primarily a
                            political objective—winning the confidence and approval of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration.</p>
                        <p>B. On the practical level, existing anti-boycott legislation is viewed as
                            a significant obstacle to the rapid expansion of Saudi Arabia’s oil
                            production capability. The importation of large amounts of new equipment
                            will be required in the next year (and particularly in the critical next
                            3–6 months) to enable Aramco to accomplish its assigned objective of
                            going “all-out” to undermine the <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>
                            price. The Boards of Directors of the Aramco parents, however, are
                            insistent upon Aramco’s rigid application of all elements of the
                            Ribicoff Amendment, lest they imperil their foreign tax credits. This
                            means that:</p>
                        <p>(1) Aramco cannot rely exclusively on its established suppliers in
                            accomplishing its urgent expansion. Everything must be put out to tender
                            on a broad scale, lest they be accused of discrimination against any
                            potential supplier for boycott-associated reasons.</p>
                        <p>(2) Bids may therefore be won by boycotted firms, meaning certain delays
                            and probable legal imbroglios. (In an effort to forestall such problems,
                            Aramco will include in all tender agreements a new clause stating that
                            any suppliers unable for any reason to deliver goods to Aramco [garble]
                            will be responsible for repatriation of the goods at their own expense
                            and risk. This may discourage legitimate bidders who know they are
                            boycotted, but will not impede mischief-makers, a prospect which is
                            causing the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> some anxiety.)</p>
                        <p>2. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> has instructed
                            Commerce Minister, Sulayman al-Sulaym, to contact the heads of certain
                            of the largest <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> corporations
                            operating in Saudi Arabia, and to encourage them to pass on to their
                            boards of directors an urgent appeal for active cooperation in opposing
                            further anti-boycott legislation by the new US Congress. In most cases,
                            the Commerce Minister has suggested that the US companies stress to
                            their managements the limitations on business opportunity in Saudi
                            Arabia that could result if more stringent legislation is passed. In the
                            case of Aramco, Sulaym was under instruction to emphasize the two more
                            specific and politically sensitive points mentioned above, namely <pb
                                facs="0672" n="637" xml:id="pg_637"/> the concern of Crown Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> that he not be
                            personally embarrassed by the passage of legislation clearly detrimental
                            to Saudi-US relations, and the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s
                            anxiety that existing and prospective anti-boycott legislation not
                            impede the production expansion program on which depends much of Saudi
                            Arabia’s capacity to impose its will on the rest of <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>. Commerce Minister Sulaym
                            specifically asked that Aramco meet urgently with its parent managements
                            to consider ways in which these corporations might mobilize their
                            political resources to achieve a postponement of further anti-boycott
                            legislation at least until two things occur.</p>
                        <p>A. Some momentum is achieved in a Middle East peace initiative—which will
                            take the heat off Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>B. Saudi oil production can be built up to the point where its real
                            leverage among <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> producers matches
                            the political objectives and requirements imposed on Saudi Arabia as a
                            consequence of its resolute stand at Doha.</p>
                        <p>3. No response to foregoing is expected. I have, however, access to
                            source if necessary.</p>

                                US–<gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> Discussion of <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> Defense Requirements. Ref: Jidda 3568,
                            4621, 3835, 173; Sanaa 1136, 0055; Amman 290.</p>
                        <p>1. Appreciate Embassy Jidda’s careful analysis of present status of
                                Saudi-<gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> relationship and of Saudi
                            aid to Yemen (Jidda’s 173). We agree that discussion of military aid
                            with Saudis has usually resulted in Alphonse/Gaston type dialogue with
                            Saudis subsequently expressing dissatisfaction with <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> unwillingness take greater role in
                            Yemen security matters. We also recognize that, with exception <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK_1">Kamal Adham</persName>, Saudis most concerned with
                            Yemen affairs are unlikely to give up patronage of influential tribal
                            leaders and military figures, both North Yemeni and dissident South
                            Yemeni, through whom <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> attempts to
                            influence developments to its south. On balance, however, we consider
                            that continued frank dialogue between us and <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> on Yemeni matters is required if misunderstandings are
                            to be avoided and our respective responsibilities for helping <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> are to be clearly established.
                            Accordingly, we hope that prior to arrival of <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> delegation you can again review with Saqqaf and with
                            Prince Sultan our present thinking about current Yemeni/South Yemeni
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>2. You may say that we appreciated receiving Saqqaf’s assessment last
                            November of situation between two Yemens. We understand and share Saudi
                            concerns over <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> and potential it
                            has as base for subversive activity elsewhere in peninsula. We have also
                            noted that Soviets did step up their aid to <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> at time of recent border hostilities with <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>. In light of November 25 Moscow
                            communiqué at conclusion <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>
                            President Salim Rubai Ali’s visit to <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, it seems clear that <pb facs="0674" n="639"
                                xml:id="pg_639"/> Soviets will continue to support their client
                            state for advantages it gives them.</p>
                        <p>3. At same time, our assessment of recent developments Yemen may be
                            somewhat different than that of <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>.
                            Experience during recent border fighting showed that South Yemeni exiles
                            of National Union Front (<gloss target="#t_NUF_1">NUF</gloss>) and
                            northern tribesmen who moved south to <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> borders were fragmented, badly disciplined, and
                            operated on their own with little or no control by <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> Army. Consequently, they unable mount effective
                            military campaign. In fact, campaign gave <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> basis for which seek additional aid from Soviets and
                            closing of ranks between two rival groups within South Yemen’s National
                            Front (i.e. the pro-Soviet ideological hardliners led by Abd al-Fath
                            Ismail and so-called “Maoist” group led by Salim Rubai Ali). Therefore,
                            we did not find October 28 Cairo Agreement to accept ceasefire and work
                            for unity between two Yemens to be capitulation by <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>. Instead, Cairo Agreement and
                            subsequent Tripoli Summit of Yemeni leaders have provided a rubric to
                            end at least for time being border warfare which had become inconclusive
                            and in which poorly-organized and uncoordinated forces operating from
                                <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> were beginning get worst of it.
                            We believe that <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> too was anxious
                            for ceasefire since it also has political and especially economic
                            weaknesses. <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>’s <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> has plummeted since Suez Canal closed.
                            Economy further aggravated by impact recent hostilities, shift of more
                            resources from civilian to military sector, and extravagant
                            nationalization measures.</p>
                        <p>4. US under no illusion that unity between two Yemens will occur.
                            Communist regime in Aden seriously divided over issue of unity. It
                            fearful of overwhelming numerical superiority of <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> which would engulf <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> if union should occur. Moreover
                            there are indications that Soviets suspicious of unity concept and may
                            be counselling Aden government against it. Accordingly, <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> can be expected to do everything
                            possible to work against implementation of real unity by supporting
                            individual acts of terrorism (mining, assassinations) in <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> and stimulating confessional split
                            between northern Zaidis and southern Shafiis. We also believe that new
                            al-Hajri government which more conservative in outlook than its
                            predecessor is very much aware of <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>
                            potential for acts of subversion and will be on lookout to counter them.
                            While we believe <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> and
                            al-Hajri are skeptical that any real progress toward unity will be
                            achieved under these present conditions. <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> nevertheless wants to be in position to demonstrate to
                            Yemeni people and to other Arab states that responsibility any failure
                            in unity moves clearly fault of <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>.
                            We believe <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> recognizes political
                            advantages this posture for <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> and
                            appreciates value of avoiding public comments against Yemen unity that
                            would embarrass al-Hajri government.</p>
                        <pb facs="0675" n="640" xml:id="pg_640"/>
                        <p>5. We believe best way to continue isolating <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> and neutralizing its potential threat to Saudi
                            security is, first and foremost, to help build up <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>’s economy. To do this effectively,
                            however, requires that assistance which is provided to Yemen be
                            channeled through <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> mechanisms. Not
                            only will it strengthen central government against competing pressures
                            of tribes and army but assure some accountability. We recognize
                            important role <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> has played in
                            providing budget support to <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> and
                            for project assistance now underway. We hope that <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s generosity will continue at this
                            critical time when President <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1"
                                >Iryani</persName> needs all support he can get. For its part,
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is now initiating a grant aid
                            program involving over ten specific projects for which we expect to
                            obligate several million dollars and which is to be supplemented by food
                            aid starting with one million dollars in <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                                >FY</gloss> 73. We plan to augment this aid by undertaking English
                            language program, scholarships, having private foundations play role in
                            public administration and seed development, and encouraging <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> agencies augment aid especially through
                            World Food Program.</p>
                        <p>6. At same time, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> recognizes that
                            training and improvement of <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> Army is
                            needed. To make <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> Army effective,
                            however, we believe will take long period of time and should not be done
                            at expense of needed economic development. Problem we both face is lack
                            of good information or judgment of what is really needed. <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> requests for arms are in vaguest
                            terms. Many types of arms clearly appear to be beyond the <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> Army’s ability to use and maintain.
                            There no idea of what useable Soviet equipment is in <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> inventory and what logistics, training
                            and operational problems occur with substitution or intermixture of arms
                            obtained from other sources. Moreover, in light recent border fighting,
                            it appears deficiency in <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> Army may
                            not be so much lack of equipment as lack of training, organization,
                            leadership, and control over and coordination with other para-military
                            units such as <gloss target="#t_NUF_1">NUF</gloss>. We hope therefore
                            that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> military will consult soon to review <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>’s equipment on hand, new equipment
                            needs, possible sources of supply and training. We also believe would be
                            worth considering encouraging incorporation of Saudi-supported <gloss
                                target="#t_NUF_1">NUF</gloss> units into <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> Army.</p>
                        <p>7. In presenting these views, you should note that US considers security
                            assistance for <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> as a regional matter
                            and that we look primarily to Saudi Arabia, Iran and possibly Jordan to
                            help in this effort. We are hopeful that <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss>’s relations with Iran will soon be back again on track.
                            Were US to enter into a direct military relationship with <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>, by providing arms and personnel to
                            train <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> armed forces, we feel this
                            could give the Soviets opportunities entrench themselves still more
                            deeply in Aden. However, we also continue to wish to encourage and
                            support regional defense cooperation. We are therefore prepared do

                            Alternatively, Saudis might consider purchase of civilian version of

                            aircraft. This is costly alternative. Dry lease costs alone
                            approximately 500,000 annually. Operating costs, spares, training, etc.
                            would more than quadruple this figure. We would guess that Saudis would
                            not consider paying high lease costs for aircraft used by <gloss

                        <p>11. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>: We agree that there could be
                            some advantages from experienced Jordan Arab Army staff officers
                            undertaking in depth review of Yemeni military situation and
                            requirements. However, we think any Jordanian involvement in Yemen
                            should come as result of Saudi or at least <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> initiative. Ground work for such a mission would need
                            be carefully prepared with Saudis (who, as you correctly point out, may
                            be less than happy to see their special role in Yemen encroached upon by
                            Jordanians) as well as with Yemenis. Also, we would not wish to add
                            Jordanian to Saudi and Yemeni pressures on US to get deeply into
                            military assistance field with <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>, nor
                            would we wish encourage King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1"

                        <p>12. <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>: With respect to possible
                            transfer of Jordanian or Gulf state Hawker Hunters to <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> Air Force, problems of support for
                            these aging aircraft could be worse than those <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> would find in supporting obsolete US F–86s. As far as
                            Gulf states are concerned, we defer to judgment of Embassy Kuwait but
                            would assume that both Kuwait and Abu Dhabi (only Gulf states with
                            Hawkers) would be unlikely to make them available to <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> until their own follow-on aircraft
                            needs have been met. Thus, it likely be matter of years rather than
                            months before Hawkers from those sources might be ready for transfer to
                            Yemen and same problems of support for obsolete aircraft would prevail.

                            and Fishing Zone of Oman. Ref: Letter of July 17, 1972, From Permanent
                            Representative of Oman to Secretary General of United Nations.</p>
                        <p>1. For AmEmbassy Oman. In referenced letter, Oman notified United Nations
                            of decrees on territorial sea, continental shelf and exclusive fishing
                            zones and requested that decrees be brought to attention of all members
                            of United Nations. Decree dated July 17, 1972, claims territorial sea of
                            12 nautical miles and fishing zone of 38 nautical miles seaward of the
                            territorial sea. <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> continues to hold
                            that under international law a state is not required to recognize a
                            territorial sea broader than 3 miles or exclusive fisheries jurisdiction
                            beyond 12 miles from the coast. Continental shelf claim is to shelf
                            depth of 200 meters or beyond that to where the waters admit of
                            exploitation of resources, a standard that is generally based on the
                            1958 Continental Shelf Convention and which the United States will not
                            protest. Because of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> position and
                            because of current negotiations on Law of the Sea, Embassy is requested
                            to deliver the following note of protest. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> normally registers its opposition and reserves its
                            legal rights through such a note.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin text (complimentary opening) . . . and refers to the decree of
                            His Majesty Sultan Qabus of Oman, dated July 17, 1972, which purports to
                            extend the territorial Sea of Oman to a distance of 12 nautical miles
                            from the coast and the fishing zone of Oman to a distance of 38 nautical
                            miles beyond the territorial sea. The United States regrets that Oman
                            has made a unilateral claim to extend its territorial sea and fisheries
                            zone in advance of international agreement on the maximum breadth of the
                            territorial sea and jurisdiction and control over fisheries. It is
                            particularly unfortunate that this action has been taken when vigorous
                            efforts are underway in the United Nations to achieve the broadest
                            possible international agreement on fisheries jurisdiction and the
                            breadth of the territorial sea to accommodate the interests of all <pb
                                facs="0679" n="644" xml:id="pg_644"/> concerned states. In
                            accordance with its long-standing policy, the United States deems it
                            necessary to state that it is not obligated under international law to
                            recognize territorial seas beyond 3 miles or coastal state fisheries
                            jurisdiction beyond 12 miles from the coast.</p>
                        <p>Unilateral extensions of jurisdiction have an extremely negative effect
                            on the current negotiations for the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            Law of the Sea Conference. Such extensions, particularly those to
                            extensive areas of the oceans, encourage other states to make unilateral
                            territorial sea claims or to assert their jurisdiction for special
                            purposes such as control over fisheries. This severely limits the
                            ability of such states to earnestly participate in the effort to achieve
                            agreement on the many issues related to the Law of the Sea. The United
                            Nations has now scheduled the Law of the Sea Conference for an
                            organizational session in late 1973 and a substantive session to begin
                            in April 1974. The United States hopes that all countries will
                            participate in the Law of the Sea Conference in an effort to accommodate
                            the needs of all nations.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with its stated positions, the United States must protest
                            Oman’s action and accordingly reserves its rights and those of its
                            nationals in all areas beyond the three mile territorial sea and with
                            respect to areas of the exclusive fishing zone beyond 12 miles.

                            <hi rend="italic">Situation in Southern Arabia—Your Meeting with Deputy
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName></hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sporadic fighting has been underway for some time in Southern Arabia as a
                            result of the activities of the radical South Yemen regime, which is
                            heavily supported by the Soviet Union and to a lesser extent by other
                            Communist countries. With the help of the Chinese, South Yemen provides
                            aid and sanctuary for Marxist rebels operating in the Dhofar region of
                            Oman. It has also supported subversive activities in North Yemen,
                            elsewhere in Oman, and in the newly independent states of the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>The Saudis, particularly since they have resumed relations with North
                            Yemen in 1970, have increasingly focused their attention on means to
                            contain and weaken South Yemen. The Saudis have provided economic aid to
                            North Yemen and have directly financed South Yemeni exiles who have made
                            raids into South Yemen from Saudi or North Yemeni territory. As a result
                            of these activities, border warfare broke out between North and South
                            Yemen last September and ended when <pb facs="0681" n="646"
                                xml:id="pg_646"/> both countries agreed to negotiate a unity
                            agreement. Negotiations for unity between the two Yemens have not
                            produced any results. South Yemen has taken advantage of the pause to
                            build up its armed forces and it is scheduled to receive Mig–21
                            aircraft. Some 170 Cubans have also arrived to help train “worker
                            militia” and act as pilots for the South Yemen Air Force. There is also
                            a Soviet military mission of some 200. North Yemen, meanwhile, has
                            sought to improve its military capability by seeking arms from Saudi
                            Arabia and Iran. The Saudis have continued their support of South Yemeni
                            dissidents and have recently begun to coordinate their efforts with the
                            Sultan of Oman, who also is seeking Saudi financial and military
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>Recently, there have been two developments involving requests from Saudi
                            Arabia related to US military equipment. The first followed the
                            mid-March meetings in Riyadh between the North Yemen Prime Minister and
                            Saudi officials, during which the gamut of Saudi-Yemeni relations were
                            reviewed and the Saudis agreed to provide an additional $20 million in
                            budget support and consider a lengthy shopping list of military
                            equipment desired by the Yemeni army. The Saudis have asked the services
                            of US military advisors in Saudi Arabia to participate with Saudi and
                            North Yemeni officers in developing a well-thought-out plan for rearming
                            the Yemeni armed forces with military equipment provided by the US
                            through Saudi Arabia. We earlier informed the Saudis of our willingness
                            to consider requests for transfer of suitable US-supplied equipment in
                            Saudi inventories to Yemen. In response, we have told the Saudis we are
                            prepared to have our advisors review the Yemeni requests with the Saudi
                            officers but not to become engaged directly with the Yemenis. To do so
                            would, we believe, encourage the North Yemenis to turn to us and seek a
                            direct <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> relationship, which we are
                            not in a position to establish. It would also be contrary to our policy
                            of encouraging regional cooperation among the Peninsula states on
                            security matters.</p>
                        <p>The second development occurred on March 22 when two South Yemeni Mig–17s
                            attacked the Saudi outpost at Wudayah, located some 75 miles north of
                            the border. The motives for the attack remain obscure but may be related
                            to an incident earlier in the month when South Yemen’s President Salim
                            Rubai Ali and National Front Secretary Abd al Fattah Ismail were
                            reportedly ambushed during a tour of the Sixth Province (adjoining
                            Oman’s Dhofar Province) and were forced to take refuge aboard a Soviet
                            cruiser which was in the vicinity. It may also have been a reaction to
                            the mid-March visit to Oman of the Saudi Minister of Defense, Prince
                            Sultan (Saudi Arabia and Iran are providing helicopters to Oman).</p>
                        <p>The Saudis have reacted by moving their British Lightning jet
                            interceptors to their southern base at Khamis Mushayt, some 300 miles
                                <pb facs="0682" n="647" xml:id="pg_647"/> west of Wudayah. The
                            Saudis have also requested US assistance in expediting the supply of
                            equipment, including munitions and rockets which could be used by their
                            newly acquired F–5B trainer aircraft. We are urgently working with the
                            Department of Defense on this request and have, among other things,
                            asked our Embassy in Tehran to review the list in the event some items
                            might be available in Iran which the Saudis could ask for directly. We
                            are also sending, at Saudi request, our assessment of the Southern
                            Yemeni situation and its possible relationship to recent border problems
                            experienced by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait with Iraq. At the same time, we
                            are requesting a Special National Intelligence Estimate on the situation
                            in Southern Arabia which will serve as background for our Program
                            Analysis and Resource Allocation (<gloss target="#t_PARA_1"

                            interrelated whole, to urge cooperation among them, and to make clear
                            that we see a mutuality of interest among them, and between them and us,
                            in the region’s security, with all concerned making contributions based
                            on the kind of resources each of us has available and is best qualified

                        <p>The current <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> request for help was
                            prompted by information it received that <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> had massed troops along its borders with the intent to

                            the strategic Bab al Mandeb Straits at the southern entrance to the Red

                            Involved:</p>
                        <p>Were <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> to attack the <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>, it would affect <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> interests and policies in the area. It
                            would be seen as a move by a Soviet-backed radical Arab state, in a
                            strategic area, against a moderate Arab regime friendly with the United
                            States. Extension of <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> control in
                            the Bab al Mandeb Straits would increase the risk that this territory
                            might be used by hostile elements, including Palestinian fedayeen or
                            Eritrean dissidents, to interdict traffic moving in the Red Sea. We have
                            an important interest in assuring continued freedom of transit for ships
                            of all nations, including our own. We would be hard pressed by the <pb
                                facs="0684" n="649" xml:id="pg_649"/> Saudis to give direct military
                            support to the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>. If the Saudis
                            should also step up their support for counter-attacks by dissident South
                            Arabian exiles along the Saudi and <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>
                            borders with <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, it would stimulate
                                <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> to seek additional Soviet
                            support. A prolonged confrontation would seriously affect the <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>’s feeble economy and a <gloss

                            intentions, we believe it is important to focus now on what we can do to
                            deter a possible <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> invasion of the
                                <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>, and how we can respond to the
                            urgent <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> request made to the Saudis
                            and ourselves to supply up to 36 jeep-mounted 106mm recoilless rifles,
                            300 trucks, 500 machine guns, 6 helicopters, and some water trucks. We
                            think it preferable to maintain low public visibility to: 1) avoid
                            complicating any efforts which may be undertaken in the Arab context to
                            calm the situation, and 2) enhance the chances that the Soviets, whom we
                            may wish to approach at some point, could play a similar helpful
                            behind-the-scene role. The following are courses of action which we
                            believe we can usefully take now which would have a deterrent effect,
                            boost <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> morale, and strengthen the
                            latter’s capabilities should such an attack occur:</p>

                            support against <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> from most other
                            members of the Arab League. That organization played an important role
                            in arranging a ceasefire and mutual withdrawal of forces following last
                            October’s border conflict between <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>. President <persName

                        <p>In the context of the Brezhnev visit, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HRM_1">Helms</persName> called your attention to a
                            recent cable from our embassy in Sanaa, North Yemen, reporting on a talk
                            between our Ambassador and the North Yemeni military chief (Tab B). The
                            cable was sent to you when it came in. The purpose of this memo is to
                            give you a brief reply if you want one.</p>
                        <p>The burden of the North Yemeni message is that it desperately needs
                            military assistance, that Saudi Arabia—whom the US has encouraged to
                            play such a role—is very slow on promised military aid, that meanwhile
                            South Yemen is being heavily supplied by the Soviets, including through
                            third parties such as Iraq and Syria, and that the fear of invasion is
                            again raised. <persName corresp="#p_HRM_1">Helms</persName> particularly
                            draws your attention to the theme of the Soviet role, presumably since
                            it relates to the general point of great power responsibility in helping
                            defuse regional conflicts.</p>
                        <p>Just after the above message arrived, another came from Saudi Arabia (Tab
                            C) saying the Minister of Defense had approved and sent to <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> a proposal for emergency
                            shipment to Yemen of arms covering about four-fifths of the equipment
                            urgently requested by Yemen. In addition, the Saudis have almost
                            completed a plan for overall strengthening of Yemeni defenses at a cost
                            of about $275 million; they are wondering how much the US will help
                            finance that.</p>
                        <p>Thus one of the problems here is that we are making an effort to get the
                            Saudis to shoulder at least financial responsibility—with our technical
                            help—for security in the Peninsula, and they are at this point slow and
                            inefficient. There is some Soviet-supported buildup in South <pb
                                facs="0688" n="653" xml:id="pg_653"/> Yemen, and the North Yemenis
                            are nervous. Nevertheless it seems reasonable for us to persist in our
                            efforts to keep the Saudis out in front on issues of aid to Yemen and
                            Oman and not to jump in and do the job for them.</p>

                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. Without attempting make independent judgment of threat of <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> attack cited by <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> Prime Minister al-Hijri and Acting
                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> al-Asnag, given <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> concern and psychological state,
                            believe it necessary for political reasons for <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> to respond promptly and positively to urgent <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> request. We think this can be done
                            without basic changes in our policy of regional cooperation, and that it
                            will in fact support that policy, since arrangements for supply,
                            discussed below, would be through friendly neighboring states. Agree
                            with Ambassador <pb facs="0689" n="654" xml:id="pg_654"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWR_1">Crawford</persName> that whatever the
                            channel, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will get suitable portion
                            of credit.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> not in position to provide grant
                            military assistance to <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>, either
                            directly or through third parties. Accordingly, payment for ammunition
                            and equipment will have to come either from Abu Dhabi, or, failing that,
                            from <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>. Re equipment/ammo from
                            Jordan or <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, if Abu Dhabi will pay,
                            believe it best that funds be transferred directly to <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> would in turn conclude sales agreement directly with
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> or Jordan.</p>
                        <p>3. Agree with Sanaa’s 1262 that we should act along three tracks to
                            respond to Yemeni requests, as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. Ammo supply from Jordan (Amman 3618): Welcome and approve immediate
                            Jordanian ammo transfer and delivery to Sanaa by RJAF C–130, providing
                                <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> can pay, either out of its
                            own funds or through Abu Dhabi financing. As stated para 2 above, <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> cannot make replacement on gratis
                            basis, although willing to sell under <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss>. Jordanian transfer of weapons to <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> is subject to provisions of <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> Act and would require Yemenis to
                            undertake not to transfer to third parties without prior <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> approval. Would expect Jordan to
                            obtain this promise from <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> prior to
                            or concurrent with delivery.</p>
                        <p>B. Remaining equipment and ammunition: Assuming Abu Dhabi or <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> funding, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> prepared to sell to <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> on <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> basis and
                            airship to Saudi Arabia for transfer to Sanaa by <gloss
                                target="#t_RSAF_1">RSAF</gloss> all remaining equipment and ammo
                            requested Sanaa 1249 para 11 not supplied by Jordanians. This would be
                            subject to <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> assurances to US re
                            non-transfer to third parties without prior <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> approval. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> estimate
                            for price and availability these and replacement items para A above will
                            be provided by <gloss target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss>. In order
                            provide adequate price and availability data we will of course need to
                            know total requirement for ammunition to be sent from <gloss
                                target="#t_CONUS_1">CONUS</gloss> for (1) replacements for Jordan
                            and (2) package to be airshipped to Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>C. Saudi emergency shipment: Prince Sultan’s message of June 21 (Jidda
                            2573) re Saudi supply of at least part of items urgently requested by
                                <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> within fortnight most welcome
                            development. However, given extreme <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>
                            unhappiness at continued <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            non-delivery, Saudis need a further jog to confirm promptly to <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> that initial shipment in fact on its
                            way. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TN_1">Thacher</persName> should at
                            appropriate level (1) inform Saudis of deepening Yemeni concern re its
                            hopeless defensive position in face of what it describes as escalating
                            fighting with <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>; (2) remind them of
                            our expressed willingness to resupply <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> on <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> basis and cover
                            part of transport costs to Saudi Arabia; (3) confirm our understanding
                            that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> has no problem with Jordanian
                            action in response to Yemeni request (Amman 3632); and (4) inform them
                            we are looking urgently at items not in Saudi or Jordanian emergency <pb
                                facs="0690" n="655" xml:id="pg_655"/> supply packages which we could
                            airlift to Saudi Arabia for onward Saudi airlift to Yemen. Also, we will
                            need <gloss target="#t_USMTM_1">USMTM</gloss>’s recommendation as to
                            what airfield in Saudi Arabia US should bring matériel. In addition,
                            Embassy should be aware that we may encounter difficulties re overflight
                            clearances and may need <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> assistance
                            in obtaining them.</p>
                        <p>4. For Sanaa: Ambassador should inform al-Hijri that (a) we understand
                                <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> has requested from Jordan
                            some of ammunition contained in request to us; (b) we prepared to
                            provide remaining equipment and ammo requested in Sanaa’s 1249 para 11
                            on <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> basis subject to <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> assurance re non-transfer to third
                            parties without prior <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> approval; (c)
                            any equipment or ammunition provided by <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> would be sent to Saudi Arabia and <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> would be expected to make
                            arrangements for onward delivery by Saudis to <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss>. As Abu Dhabi willingness to finance emergency shipment
                            obviously crucial, Embassy should query <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> re its discussions with Abu Dhabi on how financing
                            will be handled. We expect <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> to
                            handle directly all discussions with <gloss target="#t_ADG_1"
                                >ADG</gloss> re financing. However, if <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> concurs, Chargé Griffin authorized to provide price
                            and availability details when received to <gloss target="#t_ADG_1"
                                >ADG</gloss> in order facilitate early transfer funds to <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>. As regards payment we currently
                            envision letter of offer would be addressed for acceptance by <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>. Terms of sale would be dependable
                            undertaking, payment 30 days after delivery.</p>
                        <p>5. Would appreciate any further info Embassy Sanaa can provide on alleged
                            recent increased exchanges on <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> border. We have
                            no independent information here to confirm these incidents.</p>
                        <p>6. For Amman: Ambassador authorized respond to Jordanian request drawing
                            on para 3A and 3B.</p>
                        <p>7. For Abu Dhabi: Upon receipt <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> info
                            on price and availability (para 3–B above) and message from Embassy
                            Sanaa stating <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> has no objection
                            your raising subject, you should contact appropriate <gloss
                                target="#t_ADG_1">ADG</gloss> officials to pass on cost data. At
                            same time you should attempt obtain confirmation that Abu Dhabi will in
                            fact finance (a) Jordanian ammo and (b) remaining equipment and ammo
                            requests by <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> from <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. Note <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> request to Jordan includes
                            ammo for Saladins. Septel will deal with question of Saladins for

                            Consultative Assembly and COS Maswari to write <persName

                        <p>1. During meeting with Minister of Interior Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> August 25, Ambassador expressed
                            concern of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> over reports that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> was considering
                            resignation. It would be unfortunate, we felt, if President <persName
                                corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> were in fact to resign since he
                            seemed more able than any other figure to contain Yemen’s centrifugal
                            forces within present political framework. Our Ambassador in Yemen has
                            made careful assessment of situation and was convinced of importance
                                <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName>’s role as conciliator
                            and figure best qualified to hold country beset by so many divisive
                            forces together. Accordingly we suggested <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> might wish to send message to <persName
                                corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> in Syria, where we understand
                            he is on vacation, urging him not to resign. As a second step we thought
                            it would be helpful if it were more widely known in Yemen that <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> fully supports <persName
                                corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> and wished suggest message
                            might be sent to Saudi Ambassador in <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> so that through him Yemenis would understand <persName
                                corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> enjoyed Saudi Govt’s complete
                            support.</p>
                        <pb facs="0693" n="658" xml:id="pg_658"/>
                        <p>2. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> replied that he
                            could give Ambassador a full report on this matter since it had been
                            discussed at highest levels of <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> and
                            with <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> COS General Maswari and <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> Nu’man, both of whom had
                            recently transited Saudi Arabia. Prince affirmed that <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> was deeply concerned at reports of
                                <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName>’s possible
                            resignation and had looked into its possible causes. These appear to be
                            (a) desire of Zaydi chiefs to replace late Mohammed Ali ’Uthman, a
                            Shafa’i, with one of their own sectarians; and (b) high-handed behavior
                            of some of Zaydi militia among Shafa’i populations of Taiz and Hodeidah.
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> had, therefore, convinced
                            Zaydis in consultative assembly, and also Army COS Maswari, to send
                            letter to <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> stating their
                            willingness to accept his nominee to succeed Mohammed Ali ’Uthman and
                            adding that troublesome militias were being withdrawn. This letter
                            carried by COS General Maswari to <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1"
                                >Iryani</persName> in Syria about two days ago.</p>
                        <p>3. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> stated that in
                            addition, King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> was
                            sending private letter to President <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1"
                                >Iryani</persName> via <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>
                            Nu’man asking <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> to withdraw
                            his resignation. Letter supposedly states that such resignation would
                            not be in interests of Yemen or Arab nation, or any responsible
                            elements. Letter affirms King’s full confidence in President <persName
                                corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> and <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss>’s desire to be helpful in every way possible. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> commented to Ambassador that
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> sincerely wanted <persName
                                corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> to stay in office because if he
                            stepped down ensuing chaos and confustion would certainly be harmful to
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s interests. Ambassador said
                            again that he hoped message to <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1"
                                >Iryani</persName> might be supplemented by message to Ambassador
                            Sudairy, who was widely known in Yemen, to make it clear also in his
                            contacts that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> had full faith in
                                <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. Speaking most privately, Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> said that he had also spoken with Ambassador
                            Sudairy to effect that certain statements critical of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> were being attributed
                            to him in Sanaa. Upon analysis, <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1"
                                >Fahd</persName> added, these statements were traceable to various
                            troublemakers who wished to mar harmonious relations between Saudi
                            Arabia and Yemen. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> had
                            nevertheless stressed to Ambassador Sudairy need to guard against even
                            certain personal expressions of opinion—since these might be
                            misinterpreted. <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> also said
                            that as further indication of <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s
                            desire to cooperate with <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> Nu’man had been told Yemenis
                            could, if they wished, even designate some Saudi of their choice as
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s Ambassador at Sanaa.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador thanked Prince for this frank exchange of views and
                            expressed belief that Saudi démarche to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> should have beneficial effect
                            on his future action and that Saudi Govt had reacted most wisely in this
                            case.</p>
                        <p>6. At beginning of meeting Ambassador gave Prince <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> summary outline of various types
                            of <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> assistance that had been and

                        <p rend="center">PRÉCIS</p>
                        <p>The revolutionary regime in South Yemen (<gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss>) would like to bring down the conservative neighboring
                            regimes of Saudi Arabia, Oman, North Yemen (the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss>) and others in the Persian Gulf area. The
                            conservatives, in turn, consider <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>
                            a threat and would like to eliminate it. But none of these states—on
                            either side—is now able to achieve its aim by military means nor is any
                            likely to become so. Their leaders appreciate the limitations on their
                            capabilities.</p>
                        <p>We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that Aden’s leaders might
                            attack the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>. Having somewhat
                            stronger forces, they would probably win some initial successes, but do
                            not have the logistic capability to hold gains. The war would quickly
                            become defensive and tribal, and would probably be prolonged and
                            indecisive.</p>
                        <p>Additional modest programs of arms supplies from friendly states and
                            training in their use would improve the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss>’s defensive capabilities, though this would take some
                            time.</p>

                            problems there, but is not a serious threat.</p>
                        <p>To the best of our knowledge, <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> has
                            made no serious efforts at subversion in Saudi Arabia, nor does it have
                            the assets to achieve much success if it tried.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>’s backing of the Dhufar rebels in
                            Oman does constitute a threat over time to the Sultan’s regime. Our
                            knowledge of the rebels and of their parent group, <gloss
                                target="#t_PFLOAG_1">PFLOAG</gloss>, is limited, but we judge that
                            there is little <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>’s immediate
                            neighbors can do to compel Aden to reduce its support of the Oman

                            though Aden is not a puppet of Moscow. The <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> armed forces are for the most part equipped with Soviet

                            rapprochement in 1970, Soviet shipments of arms and spare parts to the

                            President and PriMin.</p>
                        <p>4. Despite apparently good atmosphere engendered by candid exchanges
                            during PriMin’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Saudi Ambassador continued and
                            intensified his criticisms of President and his contacts with those
                            military and civilian leaders who could be used against him, among
                            others members of family of Hodeida Governor Sinan abu Luhum, several of
                            whom have important military commands, and Chief of Staff Maswari who
                            known to be close to <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. A little over a week ago, Consultative Assembly President Ahmar
                            stopped in Jidda on return from official visits to <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and North Korea. Immediately on
                            return, al-Ahmar, who also regarded as responsive to Saudi wishes, began
                            to agitate against President. After <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss>’s seizure of documents attesting an Iraqi conspiracy
                            aimed at replacing present <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> with a
                            Ba’athi regime, al-Ahmar used President’s decision send his political
                            adviser Muhammad Nu’man to Baghdad to confront Iraqi President Bakr with
                            the evidence, rather than immediately severing relations, as basis for
                            criticising President for weak and incompetent leadership—a line
                            identical to that circulated by Saudi Ambassador. Matters were brought
                            to crisis evening June 12 when al-Ahmar used pretext of an alleged slur
                            against tribal leaders and their forces by a regular Army officer in
                            President’s entourage to confront President with demand that he and
                            PriMin Makki immediately resign. In this maneuver he was joined behind
                            the scenes by Hodeida Governor Abu Lumum who had returned that day from
                            visiting his brother-in-law former PriMin al-Ayni in London. Governor
                            Abu Luhum’s motivation transparently to bring about a major political
                            crisis that would obscure repeated references to al-Ayni in Iraqi
                            conspiracy documents as Iraq’s chosen candidate to replace President
                                <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName>.</p>
                        <p>6. After demanding President’s resignation, al-Ahmar decamped to his
                            tribal areas north of Sanaa and summoned tribal forces to him.</p>
                        <p>7. Morning June 13, as required by constitution, President sent his
                            resignation and that of other Republican Council senior statesman Ahmad
                            Nu’man by envoy to al-Ahmar. Latter informed envoy that his massed
                            tribes intended to occupy capital by force.</p>
                        <p>8. Military leaders have also been at odds with President for alleged
                            lack of decisiveness in dealing with Iraqi conspiracy issue, on which
                            they only slightly mollified by President’s willingness send to Iraqi
                            President Bakr through Muhammad Nu’man a sharply worded personal letter
                            of protest. Nevertheless, Deputy Commander in Chief <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> (who is the only one of three
                            senior commanders presently in country) has taken position that he will
                            defend capital at any cost. He has deployed tanks, artillery and regular
                            infantry units on roads leading into capital from north, as well as
                            around radio station and principal <pb facs="0698" n="663"
                                xml:id="pg_663"/> public buildings in Sanaa. All airports have been
                            closed. Unfortunately, a substantial infiltration into capital of
                            al-Ahmar’s armed tribesmen apparently took place before <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName>’s forces put in place.</p>
                        <p>9. President <persName corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName>, meanwhile,
                            has left the capital for Taiz to remove himself as focal point for
                            opposition of tribes and pretext for their threatened seizure of
                            capital.</p>
                        <p>10. Foreign Minister said every effort will be made to keep channel of
                            discussion with al-Ahmar open to avoid disastrous Army-tribal fight for
                            possession of capital.</p>
                        <p>11. Noting again that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> undoubtedly

                            immediately to influence al-Ahmar, <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> asked that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            urgently convey to Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName>,
                            who shows good understanding of Yemen and to Prince Sultan, who shows
                            much less, <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> message as follows:
                            (In situation described above) <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>
                            regular forces intend oppose tribal elements by force. Since this is an
                            internal matter, <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> seeks assurance
                            that in event of a clash Saudi Arabia will not intervene. Alternatively
                            and preferably for all concerned, <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>
                            hopes that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> will use its good
                            offices by all appropriate means to prevent tribal forces from
                            precipitating armed conflict. Only sure result of such conflict would be
                            a weakening of moderate leadership in Yemen and a concomitant
                            strengthening of those left wing forces which <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> jointly
                            oppose.</p>
                        <p>12. Asnag said Muhammad Nu’man, presently in Beirut, would be asked come
                            to Jidda evening June 13 to do whatever he could in support of <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> request that <gloss

                            constructively.</p>
                        <p>13. I pointed out to Asnag that current visit to Saudi Arabia by
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> would make
                            consideration by <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> of any other issue
                            very difficult during coming hours. I promised however relay his message
                            on an urgent basis.</p>
                        <p>14. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> said President <persName
                                corresp="#p_IAR_1">Iryani</persName> had ordered that his message of
                            resignation specifying threats of Consultative Assembly President and
                            use of force by tribes be broadcast at 8:00 pm this evening. However,
                            following President’s departure for Taiz, he and other leaders had
                            ordered Information Ministry differ announcement to allow more time for
                            conciliation efforts.</p>
                        <p>15. Would seem clearly constructive for the situation here for us to pass
                            Asnag’s message as requested. I would appreciate being informed of

                            relations with US. Egyptians had earlier told us, following <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> President’s visit to Cairo, that
                                <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> wanted to resume relations
                            and urged we take initiative to follow-up. After reviewing US policy in
                            Middle East and US support for cooperation among all countries in
                            peninsula, <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName> said US position
                            remained that we prepared resume relations with <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> without prior conditions and at a
                            pace that would suit <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> reps noted that meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName> had become possible
                            because of progress in Middle East but devoted almost all of their
                            discussion to peninsular issues. On several occasions, they referred to
                            the threat they saw from Saudi Arabia and the support the Saudis had
                            given to dissident groups to wage a campaign of sabotage against <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>. They viewed the insurgency in
                            Dhofar as one of self-determination. They had nothing against Sultan
                            Qabus but felt that his policy of war had only led to an Iranian
                            presence in the peninsula. They stoutly affirmed that <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> wanted only to live at peace with
                            its neighbors, that it had not let its good relations with Socialist
                            countries dictate its policies, and that it had not become a Soviet
                            base.</p>
                        <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> reps referred to the
                            country’s meager economic resources, which had been made worse by the
                            departure of the British in 1967 and the closure of the Suez Canal, and
                            their interest in gaining resources for economic development. They also
                            referred to the good relations which the US enjoys with Saudi Arabia and
                            Iran and US ability to influence Saudi and Iranian actions in the
                            peninsula because of the good US relations with these two countries.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName> gave no encouragement
                            that US economic assistance might be in the offing noting increasing
                            congressional strictures on foreign aid. We hoped <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> would be able to improve its
                            relations with its neighbors but <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Sisco</persName> noted this basically was something for the <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> to work out.</p>
                        <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> representatives welcomed
                            the initiation of this dialogue. They suggested that future contacts
                            should use <gloss target="#t_PermRep_1">PermRep</gloss> al-Astal as the
                            channel qte until the right time comes unqte. They also asked that no
                            publicity be given to this meeting.</p>
                        <p>6. Prior to meeting with <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> reps, we
                            informed Foreign Ministers <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName>
                            and Saqqaf and Oman’s Ambassador Makki because we did not want them to
                            learn about it later on. We intend to convey gist of this meeting when
                            Secretary meets with <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> and
                            Saqqaf but addressee posts may draw on foregoing in briefing appropriate
                            senior host government officials on hold-closely basis. We do not intend
                            to <pb facs="0701" n="666" xml:id="pg_666"/> give any publicity to
                            meeting. If report on meeting should leak, we intend say that we will
                            not confirm or deny it.</p>

                        <p>Oman is important to US interests because it is in a geographic position
                            (with Iran) to control the Strait of Hormuz, through which two thirds of
                            the world’s oil exports pass. Its stability is a matter of prime concern
                            to Iran and Saudi Arabia. Underdeveloped and isolated <pb facs="0702"
                                n="667" xml:id="pg_667"/> diplomatically until Qaboos took power in
                            1970, Oman is the only country in the Arabian Peninsula confronted with
                            a guerrilla insurgency, which has been underway in its southwestern
                            province of Dhofar which borders Marxist South Yemen, the principal
                            supporter of the rebels.</p>
                        <p>Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName> comes at a time of
                            rapid economic development in Oman made possible by increased oil
                            revenues, and continuing but slow success in the war against
                            communist-led guerrillas. He will be here on a nominally private visit,
                            but sees this as an opportunity to strengthen his relationship with
                            American leaders and to burnish his own image as a traditional but
                            progressive monarch both at home and in the Arab world generally. For
                            us, it provides a chance to strengthen our ties with one of the Persian
                            Gulf states, show our interest in Oman’s efforts to develop its economy
                            and defend its territory, and indicate our appreciation for the Sultan’s
                            own efforts in resisting communist-backed subversion emanating from
                            South Yemen.</p>
                        <p>Your purpose in this meeting will be:</p>
                        <p>—to reassure Qaboos that we value our historically friendly relations in
                            Oman;</p>
                        <p>—to encourage him to continue his struggle against the insurgency in
                            Dhofar, looking to friendly regional states for support;</p>
                        <p>—to compliment Qaboos on his determination to pursue a policy of rapid
                            economic development and reiterate our willingness to cooperate in
                            providing technical assistance on a reimbursable basis;</p>
                        <p>—to assure him of your personal commitment to work towards a just and
                            lasting settlement of the Arab-Israel conflict.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Background and
                            Strategy</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Background</hi>. There are no issues dividing our
                            two governments, and our involvement with Oman has been limited. Oman
                            supports the Arab cause on Israel, but dispassionately. While it
                            complied with the Arab oil boycott, it did not reduce its 300,000 barrel
                            per day production. The Omanis want a Middle East settlement primarily
                            because they feel it will undercut radical influence in the area.
                            Petroleum, produced primarily by a British-led consortium, accounts for
                            almost all of Oman’s exports and revenues. Oman is currently earning
                            $800 million from its oil; however, it is not a member of <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> and plays a passive role on oil
                            prices.</p>
                        <p>For over 150 years British interests, both commercial and military, have
                            been paramount in Oman. The British still have an air base there. The
                            Sultan himself studied at Sandhurst. The Commander in Chief of his armed
                            forces is a seconded British Major General. His de facto Minister of
                            Finance and Development is an expatriate Australian, and his special
                            personal advisor is an expatriate Canadian and former <pb facs="0703"
                                n="668" xml:id="pg_668"/> Sandhurst classmate. The Omani Army is led
                            by some 300 British officers—about half on contract and half seconded
                            from the regular British army. We support the continuing British
                            involvement in Oman since it: (a) helps to assure the continuation of a
                            moderate and pro-western regime sharing control of the entrance to the
                            Persian Gulf with Iran, and (b) serves as a bulwark against the
                            expansionary revolutionary designs of the Marxist regime in neighboring
                            South Yemen.</p>
                        <p>The Omani armed forces obtain most of their military equipment from
                            Britain. However, Oman has sought to purchase some US military items,
                            and our policy has been to be as forthcoming as our own supply situation
                            permits in the context of Oman’s legitimate needs. However, three months
                            ago we had to turn down an Omani bid to buy 100 <gloss target="#t_TOW_1"
                                >TOW</gloss> anti-tank missiles because we did not have them
                            available.</p>
                        <p>We do not have an aid program in Oman, other than some 30 Peace Corps
                            volunteers involved in such things as development of agriculture and
                            water resources, nursing and public health. Oman has increasingly asked
                            for technical assistance on a reimbursable basis through the
                            Government-to-Government channel, and in such cases we try to be as
                            helpful as possible. At the present time, for example, we are arranging
                            to send to Oman (at Oman’s expense) three air control specialists from
                                <gloss target="#t_FAA_1">FAA</gloss> and a rural electrification
                            expert. Direct private American business involvement in Oman is growing
                            as well in such diverse fields as food processing, port construction,
                            fisheries development, and legal assistance, and Sun Oil is currently
                            preparing to explore promising areas off Oman’s southern coast.</p>
                        <p>In line with the growth of our relations with Oman, we appointed a
                            resident US ambassador to Muscat for the first time in July of this
                            year. Our relations go all the way back to 1833, when we signed a treaty
                            of friendship and navigation with the Sultanate.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Strategy</hi>. Our basic policy towards Oman has
                            been to support the country’s economic development efforts and its fight
                            against foreign-backed insurgency in Dhofar without ourselves becoming
                            directly involved in that conflict. We have successfully followed this
                            policy through support of continued British involvement in Oman and
                            encouragement of regional military assistance (primarily from Iran, but
                            also to a limited degree from Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
                            Arabia). The Iranians, at Omani request, have an expeditionary force in
                            Dhofar, currently consisting basically of one infantry brigade with air
                            support. The Jordanians have provided an expert military engineer
                            company.</p>
                        <p>Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName> appreciates our
                            active encouragement of the regional support he has been receiving. He
                            is reassured by the fact that British military involvement in Dhofar has
                            not been affected by the recent Wilson Government Defense Policy Review.
                            He is likely to <pb facs="0704" n="669" xml:id="pg_669"/> be looking for
                            an affirmation from you of our continued support of his government’s
                            counterinsurgency efforts in Dhofar through encouraging regional
                            cooperation and direct sale of military equipment needed and not readily
                            available from other countries. I believe our strategy should be to
                            reassure him on this point and on our general desire to be as responsive
                            as possible (on a reimbursable basis) to any Omani request related to
                            the country’s economic development.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>—We appreciate your dynamic leadership in meeting the threat of
                            subversion emanating from South Yemen; Oman is the front line for
                            peninsula security.</p>
                        <p>—You are to be complimented on the rapid progress Oman has made since you
                            came to power in 1970 and began to earn substantial oil revenues. Your
                            economic development in the last four years has been very impressive. I
                            applaud your concern that this development serve the well-being of all
                            your countrymen.</p>
                        <p>—Let me assure you of my personal commitment to a just and lasting Middle
                            East peace. The United States will continue actively to work towards
                            this goal. We appreciate Oman’s understanding of our approach, which we
                            believe in the present circumstances must continue to be a step by step
                            one.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">US-Omani Relations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>—First, I wish to emphasize my Government’s basic policy and desire to
                            promote increasingly close relations between our two countries and to
                            foster mutual cooperation, especially in the economic and developmental
                            field. As you know, we have 30 Peace Corps volunteers in Oman.</p>
                        <p>—Your Government has approached us on several occasions seeking technical
                            assistance, on a reimbursable basis. We will continue to be as helpful
                            as we can and seek to locate personnel with the technical skills you
                            desire.</p>
                        <p>—We are also very much aware of heartening progress Oman is making in
                            meeting the challenge of externally supported subversion in Dhofar. We
                            see encouragement of regional cooperation as the best way for the United
                            States to support Oman in its courageous response to this threat. Thus,
                            as you know, we have given diplomatic support to the efforts of Iran and
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>, as well as Jordan, Saudi Arabia
                            and other friendly states, in helping Oman to meet this problem.</p>
                        <p>—If at all possible, the United States is prepared to sell Oman military
                            equipment needed for its defense. We support Oman’s strategy <pb
                                facs="0705" n="670" xml:id="pg_670"/> of pacification in Dhofar. We
                            know from our experience in Vietnam that there can be no ultimate
                            “pacification” until the local population is closely integrated with the
                            national government and benefiting from this connection through economic
                            development.</p>
                        <p>—Britain is a traditional ally of Oman. We have no desire to displace it
                            in Oman or even compete. On the contrary, we will continue to urge the
                            British to keep up their support. We think they are doing a creditable
                            job. Where we can be of supplemental help—with technical assistance and
                            weapons—we will do our best, but we think you can be the best judge of
                            when and where we are needed.</p>
                        <p>—I would be interested in your views on the possibility of an eventual
                            political settlement of the Dhofar insurgency with South Yemen. We,
                            ourselves, have no influence with the South Yemen regime, and that
                            regime has shown no real signs of interest in improving relations with
                            us despite our receptivity to the idea. But we could help line up
                            international support for you and help you coordinate any initiative
                            with other states in the area, if you so desired.</p>

                        <p>Responding to the President’s expression of welcome and his inquiry about
                            the flight to Washington, His Majesty said the long trip from London
                            earlier in the day had been comfortable and that the sunny weather here
                            was an improvement on the cloudy, nasty conditions in London. The
                            President stated that we are proud of our long, long association with
                            Oman going back to 1833, the time of President Andrew Jackson, who
                            indeed was farsighted to establish such a relationship. He added that we
                            think this long and good foundation of our relations can be expanded
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>The President asked about the American Peace Corps volunteers in Oman.
                            Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName> responded that the
                            volunteers are in such fields as social work, health and agriculture,
                            and that they are doing a good job in their scattered locations around
                            the country. The President expressed pleasure in hearing of their
                            contributions and noted that while the US has had good luck generally
                            with the Peace Corps, there are bound to be exceptions. He spoke of an
                            effort in recent years to upgrade their skills. Originally, some
                            volunteers had felt too strongly that they had primarily a social
                            mission or objective, but over the past ten or twelve years most of
                            these had been eliminated in favor of individuals with specific skills
                            to offer. Also, the Peace Corps has recruited a number of older persons,
                            including retired craftsmen with <pb facs="0707" n="672" xml:id="pg_672"
                            /> skills in agriculture and construction, for example. Such volunteers
                            wished to contribute their talents to mankind for a few years before
                            final retirement, and their presence has added sound balance to the
                            program.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would appreciate the Sultan’s assessment of the
                            situation in Dhofar, particularly the efforts of the South Yemen
                            Government against Oman. Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1"
                                >Qaboos</persName> responded that the South Yemenis indeed do
                            support the Dhofar terrorists, which they call revolutionaries, to the
                            extent that recently they have been shelling Omani positions with guns
                            and mortars from their side of the border. They also provide weapons and
                            training to the terrorists. Some 500 young Omanis have been taken across
                            the border into South Yemen for Marxist indoctrination and education in
                            two schools, one bearing the name “Lenin School.” The aim is to prepare
                            them for subsequent infiltration and trouble-making in Dhofar. In doing
                            all this, the South Yemenis have Soviet support and advisors, some Cuban
                            advisors, and some support from East Germany and North Korea. Asked by
                            the President if Red China has been involved, the Sultan replied that
                            they were at one stage but have not been helping for the past two years
                            or so. Chinese support tailed off about the time the Soviet support
                            began.</p>
                        <p>Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName> said that his
                            government is trying to put an end to the Dhofar terrorism and guerrilla
                            warfare, and that there has been much progress. He said Oman’s Iranian
                            friends are assisting, for which he is very grateful. He stated that
                            most of the territory that had been under terrorist influence has been
                            more or less pacified. Once Omani Government rule is established in a
                            given area, he tries to give his people their due by setting up schools
                            and clinics, making water available and providing job and farming
                            opportunities. The Sultan said he is convinced that the affected persons
                            now realize clearly that the Government really wants to help them. He
                            added that both his own forces and the Iranian troops have suffered some
                            losses in the past month in the course of a campaign against the
                            terrorists, who are situated in difficult terrain and hiding in caves
                            and forests. However, he hoped soon to be able to say that his forces
                            are in control of the entire area. Even then, the situation would remain
                            problematic for a long time to come if the South Yemenis continued on
                            their present course.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that the Aden regime is certainly a very
                            cantankerous group, one that has also been giving the Saudis a good deal
                            of trouble.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that the US supports Oman’s efforts to regain its
                            territory and control it. He realized there had been one or two Omani
                            requests to which, for our own supply reasons, we had been unable to
                            accede—in particular, a request for the <gloss target="#t_TOW_1"
                                >TOW</gloss> missile. Nonetheless, it remains our policy to do what
                            we can to help nations that help <pb facs="0708" n="673" xml:id="pg_673"
                            /> themselves, nations such as Oman which have the aim and ambition of
                            improving the lot of their people. The Sultan assured the President that
                            Oman’s aim is to build itself up, provide greater educational
                            opportunities, strengthen its own economy and make full use of its
                            resources. One day Oman’s oil would disappear, and his people in the
                            meantime must develop their agriculture, fisheries, minerals and so
                            forth. He said he certainly has no intention of getting involved in
                            other peoples’ internal affairs, and he does not like it when others
                            interfere in Oman. The President commented on how fortunate we all would
                            be if only this were a universal attitude.</p>
                        <p>Asked if Oman is trying to increase its oil output, the Sultan referred
                            to the two new offshore concessions now being explored by American and
                            French companies. Both are about to start drilling, and there is great
                            hope for gas as well as oil. The President inquired whether the present
                            oil producing area is located in the regions of guerrilla warfare, and
                            was told that all known oil areas are further to the north and east.</p>
                        <p>On learning that the Sultan plans to remain in the US only three days,
                            the President encouraged him to come again to have a good look at the
                            country, including the midwestern heartland as well as our more
                            publicized vacation areas such as Florida and California. When the
                            Sultan said he would like to do this sometime, probably crossing the
                            Atlantic by sea, and asked what the best season would be, the President
                            suggested anytime from May to October. While not recommending Washington
                            itself in mid-summer, he noted that His Majesty probably is accustomed
                            to much more heat, if not humidity, than Washington offers even
                            then.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the Shah has been travelling this week to
                            Jordan and Egypt. The Secretary, noting that he was aware of the
                            Sultan’s acquaintance with the Shah, said the Iranian ruler is indeed an
                            impressive person and stated that we have invited him to visit the US in
                            May.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how the Iranian troops are doing in Dhofar.
                            Responding, the Sultan said they are doing well, though in this kind of
                            a guerrilla encounter there is no substitute for experience, in knowing
                            where to look and what to do. Asked by the President whether the South
                            Yemenis helping the guerrilla are true Yemenis or are recruited
                            elsewhere, the Sultan described them as mainly Yemeni but with some
                            elements from the Gulf. They also have a local South Yemeni militia that
                            is recruited when they are in trouble.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if aircraft are useful in the kind of fighting in
                            progress in Dhofar. Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName>
                            said that helicopters prove particularly helpful and add mobility to the
                            efforts of his forces. Also, British fixed-wing Strikemaster aircraft
                            are used for low-level attacks when conditions and the terrain permit.
                            The President commented on how <pb facs="0709" n="674" xml:id="pg_674"/>
                            useful the older, slower planes had been in the Korean War for low-level
                            missions. The Secretary said that once in Korea the North Koreans sent
                            an old-fashioned biplane over Seoul and the South Koreans simply
                            couldn’t hit it.</p>
                        <p>Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName> presented one
                            request. He said Oman has sought to buy some American-made telescopic
                            sights for rifles in its possession but has been “turned down.” He hoped
                            these might be made available. The President asked General <persName
                                corresp="#p_SB_1">Scowcroft</persName> to look into the matter, and
                            told the Sultan he was glad the matter had been brought to our
                            attention. He commented that this type of sniper-scope device has become
                            far more sophisticated in recent years, and recalled seeing work being
                            done on such equipment by an Army research team at the University of
                            Michigan about twelve years ago. General <persName corresp="#p_SB_1"
                                >Scowcroft</persName> added that some modern sight-vision devices
                            actually make use of starlight.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if there is anything by way of technicians, in any
                            special areas, in which the US might be helpful. The Sultan responded
                            that he could not say there is just now, but perhaps in the future. When
                            the President stated that we feel strongly that if we can we want to be
                            helpful, Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName> said Oman
                            is a young country in the midst of a self-development effort, and needs
                            all the assistance it can get.</p>
                        <p>The President declared that he was pleased to note the British are not
                            going to pull out their support from Oman. In agreeing, the Sultan
                            remarked that at one stage he had been afraid the British might leave.
                            The President said that the US has some very serious problems together
                            with the British in helping enable them to finance some of their
                            important external activities.</p>
                        <p>On departing, Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName>
                            thanked the President very much for the time taken to receive him.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: Welcome Your Majesty (pointing to a painting on the wall).
                            What do you think of my abstract painting?</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: It is very nice.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Some people think that it is the organization chart of the
                            State Department (laughter). I apologize for having delayed this
                            meeting. I have been working with the President on a speech he is going
                            to give Sunday night on energy.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: I quite understand. I know how busy you must be.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Happily, our relations with Oman are good. There are not
                            too many problems between us that I am aware of that need solution. On
                            the question of scopes for rifles that you raised with the President
                            yesterday, these have been approved. Defense has also said that it would
                            approve the sale of a few TOWs and some military training for Omanis in
                            the United States. You will be hearing this when you visit the Defense
                            Department this afternoon and you should deal with Deputy Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> about this. I have
                            spoken to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName> about this
                            and he has agreed in principle.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: Thank you. This is something which we really need.</p>
                        <pb facs="0711" n="676" xml:id="pg_676"/>
                        <p>The Secretary: One thing we would like to know is whether US aircraft
                            which operate from our carriers when they are in the Indian Ocean could
                            land at Masirah.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: There would be no problem, just work it out with the <gloss
                                target="#t_RAF_1">RAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: When we have carriers in the Indian Ocean, occasionally a
                            reconnaissance plane needs a place to land for emergency reasons or
                            refueling. If some contingency arrangement could be worked out between
                            our two countries, it would link us much more closely.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: (nodding his head in approval)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: (hearing the chant of a demonstration by the Eritrean
                            Liberation Front outside of the State Department) You hear the noise
                            outside. They are protesting against our policy in Ethiopia. (Turning to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>) Do we have a position
                            on the Eritrean Liberation Front question?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Sisco</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: At least its not a demonstration against me. Every time
                            there is a demonstration against me, half of my associates in the
                            Department go out and join them. (laughter)</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: Perhaps they think this will please you?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: At least it gets my attention (laughter). I was hearing
                            complaints the other day that a leak concerning American weapons
                            supplied to another country had come from the State Department. I said
                            that as long as the leak was not directed against me, it could not
                            possibly have come from the State Department. (pause)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: How did you sleep. Did the building shake from the
                            traffic?</p>
                        <p>Sayyid Tarik: I had difficulty. I could not adjust to the time frame. I
                            woke up early this morning.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: I had no trouble but I did stay up late watching your
                            television.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I thought Your Majesty was going stronger at 11:00 p.m.
                            last night than at 4:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon (laughter). I read in
                            the newspapers that I had asked you to help me in finding a solution to
                            the Middle East war. I do not want to disappoint anyone and if you can
                            help, I would like any assistance you can give. What is your assessment
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>? Do you think
                            he will make a further move?</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: You know President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> better than I do. My own assessment is that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> is sincere. He wants to
                            move the situation forward. There is no doubt he will make the effort
                            towards a real settlement but whether he will risk everything with Syria
                            without the <pb facs="0712" n="677" xml:id="pg_677"/> Syrians agreeing
                            to a certain extent to what he is doing is risky. It is a risky thing
                            for a person in his position to act unilaterally.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: This is one of the damnedest negotiations I have ever been
                            engaged in. The two sides do not want to talk to each other but want me
                            to do the talking for them. Now I have to be a psychiatrist. As I told
                            His Majesty last night, I will write my memoirs only on Arab Chiefs of
                            State and Arab Foreign Ministers. They are all dominant personalities.
                            As I told His Majesty last evening, when Saudi Foreign Minister Saqqaf
                            came to Washington last year on one of his visits, the coffee maker in
                            the aircraft blew up shortly before the plane landed at Dulles. Saqqaf
                            was convinced that it was a Zionist plot and he wanted police protection
                            (laughter).</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: Did you like Saqqaf?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I liked Saqqaf very much. We were very good friends and
                            got to know each other well. I once told him that I would like to be
                            able to lead the life he led, to look the way he did—slightly
                            dissipated. (laughter) Speaking of Foreign Ministers, I recall another
                            example when after a tour through the Middle East, one Arab Foreign
                            Minister went around to check to see what I had said and drew the
                            conclusion that I had lied because I had told them all the same thing.
                            (laughter) I tell you, these Arab Foreign Ministers are not persons of
                            weak personality. Would you agree Your Majesty?</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: We come from desert background and that perhaps is the
                            explanation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Once after I talked to King <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2"
                                >Faisal</persName>, I felt that it had not been the best of
                            conversations and told Saqqaf so. The King had just told me that he was
                            not going to lift the oil embargo. Saqqaf told me that because the King
                            had said this, in fact he was going to lift the embargo. Saqqaf proved
                            to be right. At first, when I would meet with King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>, he would not look at me but
                            would pick lint off his robes. Now he looks at me. Does he look at
                            you?</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: (nodding affirmatively)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I guess I will know I have a real friend in <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName> when he starts picking lint
                            off my coat (laughter). Seriously, however, I am a great admirer of King
                                <persName corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>. He is shrewd and
                            intelligent. He has seen Saudi Arabia through many great
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: Do you think that your effort in the Middle East will be
                            successful?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Sometimes I wish there was a dispute between Norway and
                            Denmark which I could help mediate, among people who are calm in
                            character. I feel there is some movement in the Middle East. I sense we
                            are moving toward a settlement on the Egyptian side. I am like <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>—the evidence is the
                            opposite—but my instinct tells me that it is moving at least on this
                            side.</p>
                        <pb facs="0713" n="678" xml:id="pg_678"/>
                        <p>The Sultan: What about the future of Jerusalem?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I hope to pass this problem on to my successor. It is an
                            insoluble problem if handled in isolation, but I believe its future can
                            be worked out as part of a West Bank settlement. If there is a
                            settlement of the West Bank, Jerusalem will follow logically. I have all
                            along felt that given Israel’s strong emotional feelings over the issue,
                            it was better to make it a part of the West Bank settlement rather to
                            make it a separate issue. I have explained this to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_FIAAS_2">Faisal</persName>. He may or may not agree but
                            he has accepted my explanation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: (moving in his chair with some stiffness)—Your Majesty
                            talked so much about horseback riding last night that I wrenched my back
                            (laughter).</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: In your approach on Jerusalem, have you considered the city
                            under some kind of a trust with Muslims, Christians, and Jews
                            administering the city on a religious basis?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Are you talking about the whole city or the old city?</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: The old city. It would not be a political administration but
                            a religious one.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I have always felt that if the Israelis were imaginative,
                            they could contact the Arabs and discuss the possibility of some kind of
                            condominium in the old city. But Your Majesty has presented an
                            interesting thought of a religious rather than political
                            administration—a rather interesting idea.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: What do you think of the situation around the Gulf?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Our interest is to keep this region peaceful and stable.
                            We are strongly opposed to the efforts of the radicals, especially South
                            Yemen, to extend their influence. I do not know if the Iraqis are very
                            active. Our relations with Iran are very good. The Shah is a friend and
                            we support his efforts to maintain the integrity of Oman. The Saudis are
                            always rather apprehensive about the Iranians, however.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: That is true.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: There has been a lot of discussion about my <hi
                                rend="italic">Business Week</hi> interview. I said we would not use
                            force over the question of oil prices but no one can believe that there
                            would not be consequences in case of a total embargo where there is
                            strangulation of the industrialized world. There are now a lot of
                            cowards in Europe who hope to impress the Arabs but if they are hurt,
                            they will be the first ones to come to us. To portray this as a threat
                            against the Arabs is ridiculous. I have been the greatest advocate for
                            improved relations with the Arab world. In the Persian Gulf, we want to
                            expand our commercial relations and our economic ties. And in the case
                            of Oman, we have a great interest in the progress and independence of
                            your country.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: I appreciate this very much. We will always want to work
                            closely with you.</p>
                        <pb facs="0714" n="679" xml:id="pg_679"/>
                        <p>The Secretary: I am sorry that I have not been able to visit Oman. I had
                            planned to do so last May but the negotiations took so long and our
                            security people were nervous—not about Oman—but in other Gulf states
                            because of their Palestinian population.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: They were very wise.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Would there be a problem in Oman?</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: Not in Oman but in the other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: (turning to Sayyid Tarik)—Your uncle looks like a man who
                            should be able to take care of security matters.</p>
                        <p>Sayyid Tarik: Security in some of the Emirates is very lax. Subversives
                            are not under control. Although in Bahrain there is greater concern now,
                            the Bahrainis have yet to take this very seriously.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: One or two states in the Gulf which I should have visited,
                            but which I have avoided are Kuwait and Bahrain. My security people feel
                            they are not quite safe.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I was told Kuwait was not safe but I had not heard this
                            was the case for Bahrain.</p>
                        <p>Sayyid Tarik: The rulers there have not been tightening the screws on
                            subversives because they do not feel strong enough to deal with these
                            groups. This is true in Kuwait and in Bahrain.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: King <persName corresp="#p_HIBT_1">Hussein</persName> has
                            told me that he brings his own security when he visits this area. He
                            advised me not to visit Kuwait.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: He was right.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Is Iraq active in the Gulf?</p>
                        <p>Sayyid Tarik: Yes, the Iraqis support some of these subversive groups,
                            they promote their Baath ideology.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: Iraqi activities are under the guise of the branches of their
                            commercial bank. In Bahrain the authorities recently captured weapons
                            being smuggled in from Iraq. At first, the Bahrainis thought they were
                            for use against them but were told no, they were in transit for use in
                            Oman. In Dubai, the same thing has happened. There are also activities
                            as far as Pakistan with the support of the Baluch.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Do you know President <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1"
                                >Bhutto</persName>? He is a very interesting man.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: Yes, I know <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Bhutto</persName>. I
                            have visited him and he has visited me. When one talks about stability
                            in the Gulf region, it is difficult to do as long as the people are not
                            aware of the threat. Once they are aware, then they know what to do.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: In the US, psychiatrists are always trying to operate on
                            the theory of making individuals aware of problems they did not know
                            about before to explain their behavior. My problems are based on the
                            things that I am aware of (laughter). But I agree, awareness of <pb
                                facs="0715" n="680" xml:id="pg_680"/> the essence of countering
                            subversion and how subversives operate is important. An insurgency has
                            to be captured very early, otherwise it becomes difficult to
                            control.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: This is what we have told the Iraqis who always try to claim
                            that they are friendly with us while at the same time they are
                            supporting South Yemen. We have told them that as long as they do this,
                            we will not exchange Ambassadors. At one time, the Iraqis tried to force
                            the issue by sending an Ambassador to Muscat, staff and all.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Without an <hi rend="italic">agreement</hi>? I hope you
                            sent him back.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: Exactly. We sent him back.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What about your relations with Syria?</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: We have not exchanged Ambassadors but we are friends of the
                            Syrians. The Syrians are different than the Iraqis and have to be dealt
                            with in a different way. The Syrians, however, just as the Kuwaitis,
                            have given some support for South Yemen. At the same time, South Yemen
                            is trying to make itself more attractive with other Arab states,
                            particularly in the Gulf, by changing the name of the Popular Front for
                            the Liberation of Oman and the Arab Gulf to simply the Popular Front for
                            the Liberation of Oman. They are getting some money out of the Kuwaitis
                            and as a result of this action, they hope to get more money from the
                            Kuwaitis and from other Gulf states.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Kuwait does this because of its domestic situation.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: We do not like this because we think this aid makes the enemy
                            (South Yemen) even stronger. It does not make him change his policy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I agree it does not work. If they feel so weak that they
                            try to buy them off, it is like blackmail.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: The only way to change South Yemeni policy will be if all the
                            refugees who have left—and many have a good, distinguished
                            background—were allowed to return. If they could come back, this would
                            not mean that the communists would fade away but they would offset their
                            position and it would bring about a situation where peace and security
                            could return to the region.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Your Majesty can count on our support and we will continue
                            to keep in close contact through our Ambassador. We believe your visit
                            has brought us an awareness of the reality of Oman. You will always be
                            welcome here.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan: Thank you. I have seen so much that I want to come back and
                            spend several weeks with my family.</p>

                        <p>After opening pleasantries, <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CW_2">Clements</persName></hi> remarked that he had
                            heard that the discussion with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> had gone well and wondered if the Sultan would
                            like to address some of the items which had been raised in that
                            conversation. <hi rend="italic">Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1"
                                    >Qaboos</persName></hi> replied that he had asked for several
                            items of equipment and training and had been assured that the US was
                            agreeable to providing these. Concerning the navy which Oman planned to
                            establish, there were many details which would have to be worked out
                            with the appropriate officials. The Sultan felt that some people should
                            be sent out to Oman to study the situation and determine Omani needs,
                            then liaison on how to proceed could be worked out with the Omani
                            Embassy in London. He was particularly concerned with developing a
                            program of training. He hoped that a group of Omanis could be trained
                            initially and that these personnel could then provide training to others
                            in Oman. The conversation with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> had included mention of <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> missiles, telescopic sights, and US
                            use of the base on Masirah Island. The details would have to be worked
                            out.</p>

                                >Clements</persName></hi> inquired about approaching the British
                            concerning use of Masirah. He assumed that if the Sultan had no
                            objection to its use by the US that the British would have none. <hi

                            and foresaw no British objection. <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName

                                Tarik</hi> replied that the Sultan’s party would take up the matter
                            with the British and then “call on you.” <hi rend="italic">Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName></hi> noted
                            the present <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> role in training the
                            Omani forces and wondered whether the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>
                            would be concerned about US involvement. <hi rend="italic">The
                                Sultan</hi> foresaw no objection. He noted that the Navy had just
                            been created and that it now included some Pakistanis who had not proved
                            fully satisfactory. The Navy currently had only three or four ships; it
                            was hoped in the future to raise this to a total of eleven vessels.
                            There was certainly “room for another friend to help.” The Sultan asked
                            that all defense matters be coordinated with Mr. Omar in London, and
                            that any team going to Oman stop in London for coordination on its way
                            out.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretary’s question about the Air Force, <hi
                                rend="italic">the Sultan</hi> noted that at present it was operating
                            almost exclusively with British assistance. He saw no immediate need for
                            US assistance, perhaps later. “When we get to the point of having our
                            own people doing operations and when there is more money, perhaps we
                            might want to buy your aircraft.” However, he was interested in
                            assistance on the Navy immediately. <hi rend="italic">Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Schlesinger</persName></hi> noted
                            that in view of the British presence we would want to insure that our

                            move more forces into that sector. At Soviet suggestion, they are
                            rethinking their total force structure and are considering dividing them
                            into three self-sufficient sectors: one force in the east near Dhofar,
                            one on the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> border, and one for the

                            would have its own tanks and air support. Although the <gloss

                            provide a great deal of equipment, and the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> was becoming a real threat militarily. The battle in
                            Dhofar Province was going well, especially with Iranian assistance, but
                            his concern was that as the tide turned against the rebels there would
                            be a move to divert attention to other areas, perhaps to Habarut in the
                            north where tanks can be used. The <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss>
                            would be particularly useful to counter such an eventuality. Asked if he
                            was satisfied with the prospects in Dhofar, he replied that he was. The
                            Iranians had never fought a guerrilla-type war before and that they had
                            had to learn some lessons the hard way by taking some initial losses
                            “which shouldn’t have occurred.” There are very few guerrillas, but they
                            can position themselves to snipe or can operate from concealed positions
                            with mortars or Katyusha rockets. Consequently it is dangerous to
                            operate except in small groups.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question about helicopter support, <hi rend="italic">the

                            satisfactory. Helo support is absolutely critical given the very
                            difficult terrain. Iran has its own helo support. “We may ask you for

                            mentioned that the Italian Air Force had made twelve helos available

                            that the helos had been fired at with small arms but no missiles to
                            date. He also noted that the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> had
                            bombed Omani positions on one occasion using ILYUSHINS. A total of eight
                            bombs were dropped. They could attack overtly in this manner since they
                            could always claim that they disagreed with the border location.
                            However, they had never used close air support against Omani forces.
                            They did have extremely long-range artillery which could fire across the
                            border. (In a side discussion, Generals Sumner and <persName
                                corresp="#p_WJ_2">Wickham</persName> stated that the reported 30 km.
                            range was compatible with the Soviet 130 mm. gun.) Omani artillery could
                            not reach the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> sites in Hauf. The
                            Yemeni artillery was quite accurate, and <hi rend="italic">General
                                Sumner</hi> concurred noting that our own experiments with this
                            weapon had shocked the US artillery experts with its accuracy at very
                            long range. <hi rend="italic">The Sultan</hi> noted that the Omanis had
                            tried to convince the Iranians to reply with air strikes but they were
                            unwilling to do it. British aircraft never fly operational missions in
                            Oman due to the political sensitivities in the <gloss target="#t_UK_2"

                            defenses on the Yemeni side would make a strike by Omani Strikemasters
                            suicidal.</p>

                        <p>Asked by <gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss> whether the Yemenis
                            were moderating their policies, <hi rend="italic">the Sultan</hi>
                            replied that it was all appearances. They had cut the “Arab Gulf” off
                            the title of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman and the Arab
                            Gulf in order to permit more friendly relations with the gulf states.
                            The Sultan said he could take little comfort in that since it left Oman
                            as the sole target. He believed the current strategy was to bring down
                            Oman first then turn to the gulf. He noted that he had confronted the
                            Kuwaiti Foreign Minister with this at the Algiers Nonaligned Conference
                            and he had discounted it as a rumor. Several months later it happened.
                            “The Kuwaiti policy of trying to buy their enemies is wrong.” <hi
                                rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss></hi> noted
                            that our reports indicated that Kuwait was funding a fair amount of
                            subversion in the area, which can be interpreted either as “buying time
                            or a bigger noose.”</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Sultan</hi> noted that President <persName

                            Egypt attaches great importance to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, however, so
                            they must maintain a relationship with the Aden regime. They have worked
                            out an arrangement on Perim Island for a 99-year Egyptian lease which
                            will be financed by a payment of ±50 million sterling to South Yemen (40
                            million from Saudi Arabia and 10 million from Abu Dhabi). The Sultan
                            considered this “crazy” since it bought time for the Aden regime and
                            permitted it to strengthen itself. Moreover, the island is of no
                            consequence. The North Yemenis hold land overlooking the island which
                            dominates it militarily. They would have been better off giving the
                            money to the <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> and achieving the same
                            objective. This was suggested, but no one paid any attention. <hi
                                rend="italic">Yahya Omar</hi> noted that the Soviets are waiting to
                            get their hands on the money. <hi rend="italic"><gloss

                            seriously, he found the present situation distressing. The gulf states
                            which finance subversion are courting their own destruction—either from
                            the Soviets moving down to the South or their own downfall from within.
                                <hi rend="italic">The Sultan</hi> commented that some people seem to
                            enjoy making trouble for others. The Yemenis realize that if they
                            controlled the Strait of Hormuz, they could move to take over the whole
                            area. The Soviets play on this dream of incredible wealth to strengthen
                            their own position.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1">SecDef</gloss></hi> noted
                            US concern over the buildup of the Soviet Navy in the Indian Ocean. It
                            had been slow and steady, but we fear and expect further expansion in
                            the area, particularly when the Suez Canal opens. We must balance Soviet
                            power in the area. The problem is convincing the people on the Hill.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_2"

                            Soviet presence in Somalia. <hi rend="italic">The Sultan</hi> replied
                            that he was “not at ease” with the situation. He had seen the Somali
                            President in two meetings and was assured in each case that Somalia was
                            an independent nation which did not <pb facs="0720" n="685"
                                xml:id="pg_685"/> want to be a “tail” to anyone. However, they feel
                            the need to strengthen themselves and were forced to turn to the Soviets
                            for assistance when the West failed to provide support. In the Sultan’s
                            view, whether or not they are aware of danger, the Soviet presence
                            doesn’t “put anyone at ease.” The Soviets have Aden and Somalia, and
                            therefore the entrance to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. In Berbera,
                            the Soviets have “all they want at the moment” in the way of access,
                            though their tactics may be not to ask for too much at any one time. In
                            answer to a question he said he did not know whether Somalia would
                            permit the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to conduct unilateral
                            operations from Berbera without Somali permission. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName></hi> mentioned
                            that in his recent visit to Somalia and Aden, Soviet Admiral Gorshkov
                            had talked of British naval help in building up the Omani Navy. This was
                            not true. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1"
                                >SecDef</gloss></hi> remarked that this sounded like a pretext for
                            expanding the Soviet naval presence and assistance in the area and noted
                            that we should review carefully what Gorshkov had said. He noted that
                            the Soviets were worried about their forces possibly being caught south
                            of the canal in a crisis and that their interest in bases related to
                            this concern, suggesting that this subject deserved more study. He noted
                            that the Soviet presence in Aden could be compared to their previous
                            activities in Cuba where the relationship with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> led to the export of subversion to
                            other states in Latin America. A review of the Cuban experience would
                            reveal a blueprint for similar Soviet operations from Aden.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Sultan</hi> asked, in the event of physical
                            intervention by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, could a US
                            reaction be anticipated? <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_SecDef_1"
                                    >SecDef</gloss></hi> replied it would be very quick. The Soviets
                            must be warned off. Soviet domination of the Middle East would be a
                            catastrophe for the industrialized states and the world as a whole. The
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has gradually reduced its
                            problems with China and in Southeast Asia. As a result, they are
                            increasingly able to focus on the Middle East which they recognize as a
                            fertile area for them over the next decade. In view of the high payoff
                            potential and if they are given the opportunity, it seems reasonable
                            that they will get increasingly involved. We expect a dramatic increase
                            in activity by the Soviets in the Middle East. They consider this
                            compatible with their view of “détente.” In fact, the Soviets do not
                            speak of détente; instead they speak of “peaceful coexistence”, which is
                            a term coined by Lenin to describe a policy of lulling the West into
                            inattention and inaction. He told a story of two tourists at the Moscow
                            Zoo who are shown a cage in which a Russian bear and a terrified lamb
                            live in “peaceful coexistence.” When the tourists find this remarkable,
                            the guide says that indeed it is, but of course they have to put in a
                            new lamb each day. In the Soviet view, détente permits probing in the
                            Middle East. Comparable activity in Europe might be more costly since it
                            would risk galvanizing the Europeans. Nations such as Iraq and Kuwait
                            should <pb facs="0721" n="686" xml:id="pg_686"/> recognize the peril in
                            playing the Soviet game. <hi rend="italic">The Sultan</hi> noted that

                            and do our best to give them an answer shortly. He noted that <gloss

                            provide this system, the better it would be.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The visit of Sultan <persName corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName> has
                            left behind some important questions about our future security policy
                            toward Oman and the Gulf. A memorandum examining aspects of our Omani
                            relationship is at Tab B. Briefly, these questions include:</p>
                        <quote>
                            <p>—The purposes for which US military ships and aircraft need to use
                                facilities in Oman, and the existence or absence of alternative
                                facilities. (The Sultan in principle has agreed to a limited US use
                                of the airfield on Masira Island. The British have asked us what use
                                we might <pb facs="0722" n="687" xml:id="pg_687"/> make of the
                                island, noting the minimal facilities there and the need to supply
                                even water by ship).</p>
                            <p>—Our interest in directly equipping, training or advising the
                                Sultan’s forces. (During the visit of the Sultan we agreed to a
                                study team for his forces which are, at present, almost entirely
                                non-Omani in nationality. They are equipped, trained and advised by
                                those states directly engaged in helping the Sultan defeat the
                                rebellion.)</p>
                            <p>—The role of other states in Omani security and their attitudes
                                toward more direct US involvement. (The Iranians, the British, the
                                Jordanians and the Saudis are now deeply involved in supporting
                                Oman, assuming the primary military role with our approval and
                                encouragement in the context of our policy of maximum regional
                                self-reliance. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, with the
                                help of Iraq and South Yemen, is supporting the Omani
                                opposition.)</p>
                            <p>—The strategic and political importance of Oman for the Gulf and
                                South Arabia. (The Sultan, who is reasonably well in control after
                                two years of power when oil prices were rising, blocks certain
                                radical and Soviet interests. Oman is, however, more of a dependent
                                state than one which exercises influence of its own in the region.
                                Oman also produces a small amount of oil for export.)</p>
                            <p>—The negative aspects of a deepened US commitment to Oman and the
                                implications of a growing US military presence in South Arabia and
                                the Indian Ocean.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>The bases for US security policy and force deployment in the Gulf and
                            Oman are <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 92 of July 30, 1970 and
                                <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 186 of April 24, 1972
                            (Government Arms Sales to Oman), which directs that the primary
                            responsibility for the security of the region should fall upon the
                            states of the region, and that a continuing British role should be
                            encouraged. <hi rend="italic">An up-date is needed.</hi></p>
                        <p>We believe that before we send the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>
                            study team for a survey of either the Masira facilities or the Sultan’s
                            forces there should be a careful review of our present policy. To date,
                            this has been remarkably successful in drawing others into cooperative
                            security efforts in the Gulf as well as Dhofar. There are, however,
                            signs of strain.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">We may decide that we will want to proceed no further
                                in deepening our presence in Oman—or, alternately, that we have
                                fewer qualms now about replacing the British there. We may even want
                                to seek a major role ourself in preserving Gulf security and
                                positioning ourselves for other contingencies. However, we do not
                                now want to move in either direction without considering how small
                                steps relate to our overall strategic interests, without a review of
                                other options for protecting these interests, and without
                                considering what action we can take to minimize any unfavorable
                                repercussions of a change in our present policy. The study is needed

                        <p>At Tab A is a memorandum to the Chairman of the Under Secretaries
                            Committee requesting that the study mentioned above be submitted for the

                                both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. The latter question was
                                discussed between Qaboos and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                                    >Schlesinger</persName>, but was not pinned down in detail. In
                                addition, <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> agreed to send a team
                                of three officers to Oman to study the improvement of the Omani
                                Navy, and possibly of Omani ground forces as well.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">What Qaboos Thinks He Gave</p>
                            <p>In return, Qaboos consented to the use of Masira Island’s landing
                                facilities (presently run by the <gloss target="#t_RAF_1"
                                    >RAF</gloss>) by US reconnaissance aircraft in <pb facs="0724"
                                    n="689" xml:id="pg_689"/> need of refueling or emergency
                                assistance. As far as can be determined Qaboos did not ask, and was
                                not informed during any of his meetings in Washington, about the
                                types of US military aircraft which might avail themselves of Masira
                                or the purpose and frequency of use, although the impression was
                                given that this would be only occasional. He only asked that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> make the necessary
                                arrangements with the <gloss target="#t_RAF_1">RAF</gloss>.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">What <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>
                                thinks Qaboos Gave</p>
                            <p>Certainly, the US Navy is interested in Masira as a convenient
                                emergency stop and a sometime refueling facility for aircraft in
                                transit to other Indian Ocean facilities. It is also apparently
                                interested in Masira as a possible regular-use airport for Lockeed
                                P–3 Orion reconnaissance aircraft now stationed at Bandar Abbas,
                                some 450 miles further north, and as a transit/refueling stop for CV
                                support aircraft, such as the Grumman C–1, operating in the area.
                                This question has taken on greater currency with the arrival of the
                                Enterprise in the Indian Ocean, but the Navy’s interest is
                                undoubtedly of longer duration than the Enterprise’s cruise.</p>
                            <p>A related factor is the interest of the US Air Force in using Masira
                                as a landing point for F–111’s. In 1971 or early 1972, shortly after
                                Qaboos took power, the British were sounded out about the
                                possibility of a small group of F–111’s flying from Europe to Masira
                                to demonstrate the US Air force’s ability to deploy into the Indian
                                Ocean if necessary. The British deferred to Qaboos, who declined
                                permission but did not shut the door completely. It is likely that
                                this request will now be renewed by the <gloss target="#t_USAF_1"

                            <p>Heretofore, our interests in Oman have been well served by our
                                strategy of backing the continued military presence of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> and encouraging Iran and Saudi
                                Arabia (and to a degree Jordan and Egypt) to combat radical elements
                                in the Gulf and support Oman’s military in its struggle with the
                                South Yemen-backed rebellion.</p>
                            <p>The British have assumed the primary responsibility of advising
                                Qaboos on both foreign policy and military affairs and have exerted
                                strong influence over the direction of the Dhofar war. Although they
                                have had a payback in prestige and money from military sales to
                                Oman, late last year it took our strong urging to convince them not
                                to abandon Masira as a British base.</p>
                            <p>The weakened position of the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> at
                                home and abroad is undoubtedly not lost on Qaboos, who must
                                certainly realize that before too long the British could well
                                withdraw permanently their military presence from South Arabia.
                                Reservations in his own mind about the desirability of maintaining
                                the intimacy of his relationship with the British <pb facs="0725"
                                    n="690" xml:id="pg_690"/> may already exist; there have
                                certainly been costly errors of judgment committed by his military
                                advisor, Major General Creasey, in the conduct of Qaboos’s forces
                                against the Dhofari rebels; and Yahya Omar, the Libyan loyalist
                                advisor to Qaboos, who accompanied the Sultan to Washington and is
                                involved in all military matters, makes no secret of his intense
                                personal dislike of the British.</p>
                            <p>If the Sultan is considering the possibility of eventually replacing
                                the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss>, his visit to Washington came
                                at an opportune time. His perception of the willingness of the US to
                                work with Oman must certainly have been reinforced by his
                                conversations here, by the eagerness of <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                    >DOD</gloss> for access to Masira, by our immediate supply of
                                hitherto unavailable TOWs and by our decision to send a military
                                evaluation team to Oman in the next few weeks.</p>
                            <p>The British may also see the US as a possible replacement in Oman,
                                given Labor policy of progressively phasing out military presence
                                East of Suez. Turning the base and the burden for helping Oman
                                control its rebellion over to the US could have a certain
                                attraction, although there are also elements of jealousy and
                                national pride which push the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> to
                                stay. In regard to our use of the Masira airfield the British have
                                asked several specific questions about the extent to which it will
                                be used, as well as about our military supply relationship. They
                                state that they are unable to logistically support more than
                                occassional aircraft. They imply that anything greater would require
                                US assistance and, very possibly, personnel.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">Policy Implications for the US</p>
                            <p>The reasons behind keen <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> interest
                                in access to military facilities on Masira are understandable, given
                                our strategic interest in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East.
                                Masira has an excellent location for surveillance and possible
                                interdiction of hostile shipping, not only in the Indian Ocean but
                                also the Persian Gulf and Straits of Hormuz (critical for oil
                                shipments) and the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandeb (of importance
                                vis-à-vis Israel and of even greater importance, particularly
                                vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, should the
                                Suez Canal reopen). It provides an excellent link between Diego
                                Garcia and facilities available to the US in Iran, Turkey and
                                Greece. It is in a good position to support US Navy operations in
                                the Gulf, Red Sea or South Arabia. It provides a good site for area
                                familiarization and training and it would be a valuable staging area
                                in event of a conflict involving US forces.</p>
                            <p>On the other side of the coin, however, US interest in Masira will in
                                all probability generate pressures for an even closer US-Omani
                                relationship, and requests from the Omanis for US assistance in
                                weaponry and military advice which may require positive responses if
                                the use of Masira, once gained, is not to be lost. In sum, the
                                Island could <pb facs="0726" n="691" xml:id="pg_691"/> become a
                                static Omani <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> for escalating US <hi
                                    rend="italic">quos</hi>. More important, any reduction of
                                British presence in Oman will place greater onus on the US to be the
                                Sultan’s strategic ally.</p>
                            <p>At the moment, US involvement is still slight. The TOWs require only
                                two US trainers on a non-government basis, and the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >occasional</hi> use of Masira by aircraft may not require US
                                support personnel. Greater involvement, particularly that which may
                                follow the visit of a <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> team,
                                could well result in a semi-permanent US military presence in
                                Oman.</p>
                            <p>The primary question that needs to be answered is whether the
                                military reasons moving the US toward a deeper relationship with
                                Oman are counterbalanced by an interest in staying out. Unless
                                clearer guidelines are developed on the basis of such a policy
                                examination, we risk slipping gradually and naturally into a
                                relationship which will be seen by Oman, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq
                                South Yemen, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> and others as being deeper than now
                                foreseen.</p>

                            Oman as requested in February (Tab B).</p>
                        <p>The review came shortly after the visit to the US of Sultan <persName
                                corresp="#p_QA_1">Qaboos</persName>, when it appeared that the
                            Omanis were strongly interested in establishing a new relationship with
                            the US, envisioning inter alia a military relationship involving US arms
                            supply and use of Masirah Island airbase, with the possible thought that
                            over the long term the US might replace Great Britain as Oman’s
                            great-power sponsor. As a result of Qaboos’s visit, the US agreed to
                            send <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss> missiles to Oman and to
                            dispatch a <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> team to look into Omani
                            Navy needs, while Qaboos agreed in principle to our use of the airfield
                            on Masirah Island.</p>
                        <p>The new direction which Oman appeared to be seeking in its relationship
                            with the US diverged from earlier <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                            policy directives (<gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 92 and 186).
                            These stated that the security of the states of the lower Persian Gulf
                            should be primarily a regional responsibility, although in the case of
                            Oman we intended also to encourage the British also to maintain their
                            advisory role. Because of the need to reassess the implications of
                            existing policy for our role in Oman, you directed National Security
                            Study 217.</p>
                        <pb facs="0729" n="694" xml:id="pg_694"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>, the Chairman of the
                            NEA/IG, has now forwarded the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 217
                            response, a Study approved by the Secretary of Defense and the Director
                            of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>. The Study describes four
                            options for possible US decision, ranging in descending order from a
                            major commitment of US forces to Masirah and a very deep relationship
                            with the Sultan, to a minimal involvement option which would see only
                            the very occasional and sporadic use of Masirah by US aircraft at
                            intervals of not more than once every two or three months. The Study
                            essentially endorses the validity of the earlier policy directives and
                            finds that while our forces in the Indian Ocean area can usefully employ
                            Masirah Island’s landing facilities for occasional landings by US
                            aircraft, the potential liabilities of a large US presence in Oman
                            outweigh the advantages such a presence might give.</p>
                        <p>The IG recommends unanimously the adoption of the third option, which
                            provides for occasional access to Masirah by US aircraft, but which does
                            not require the stationing of any US military personnel in Oman. This
                            option would continue our existing, self-imposed limits on our military
                            sales to Oman, looking to the British to supply most if not all arms and
                            to the British, Iranians, Jordanians and Saudis for training and other
                            military services and aid. However, this option would let us respond to
                            special requests like the Sultan’s desire for the despatch of a <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> team to look into Omani Naval needs.
                            The team in this case would be instructed not to discuss equipment
                            availability. This option is satisfactory to the Department of Defense
                            as meeting our present minimal military needs while giving us an option
                            for future expansion, as well as to State in foreign policy terms.</p>
                        <p>It would probably be acceptable to Congress—which is taking a specific
                            interest in our use of Masirah—if they were properly and thoroughly
                            briefed, particularly about the maximum limits this option would place
                            on our involvement. The higher level options are believed unlikely to
                            overcome Congressional resistance, are not essential in military terms,
                            and would tend to complicate rather than improve our relations in the
                            Gulf.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff concurs in the IG
                            recommendation.</p>
                        <p>A memorandum to the President describing the Study’s conclusions, options
                            and recommendations and Congressional aspects is attached at Tab A. It
                            recommends the approval of Option 3, but provides Option 4 as an
                            alternative. <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>’s appropriate to
                            each option are attached. The memorandum also attaches the Study.</p>
                        <p>Concurring memoranda from the various Agencies involved in the Study,
                            including a discussion by Defense of some of the Congressional aspects
                            are attached at Tab C. In his memorandum, Director <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW_3">Colby</persName> raises the tactical question of
                            considering a possible delay in implementing Option 3 until changes in
                            Indian Ocean activity as a result of the <pb facs="0730" n="695"
                                xml:id="pg_695"/> opening of the Suez Canal can be observed. This is
                            noted in your memorandum to the President. Rather than incorporate it
                            formally into the <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>, we believe
                            this aspect can be handled after the President has made a decision on
                            which course US policy should take.</p>

                        <p>Evidence of attempts by outside powers to gain influence and shape events
                            in the Arab Gulf raises some fears about middle- and long-term security
                            of the small, but energy-important states that ring the eastern
                            periphery of the Arabian peninsula. The tactics of Iraq, the Soviet
                            Union, extremists in the Palestinians community, South Yemen, and Libya
                            may vary, but all have been involved in clandestine operations and
                            subversive action in the Gulf.</p>
                        <p>Although there are occasional indications of conflict between these
                            external forces—Iraq and South Yemen have disputed whether Baghdad or
                            Aden should have the leading role in exporting revolution to the
                            Gulf—more often there is a cooperation based on a commonality of
                            interest. For example, there is evidence that Soviets and some fedayeen
                            organizations have cooperated in clandestine activity in Kuwait, and
                            that South Yemen, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, Iraq, and
                            Libya have jointly supported the Dhofar rebels. To the extent that
                            radical Arabs and the Soviets act in concert in their effort to subvert
                            the moderate rulers in the Gulf, another dimension is added to the job
                            facing local security forces in devising effective countermeasures.</p>
                        <p>In the following memorandum, we examine the subversive role being played
                            in the region by non-indigenous radical Arabs and the <pb facs="0731"
                                n="696" xml:id="pg_696"/> Soviets Union and we speculate on future
                            developments. The current dossier on subversive action in the Gulf
                            underlines a number of intelligence gaps and strongly suggests that the
                            activities of the outside forces under review would bear close
                            monitoring in the future.</p>

                        <p>Aden has adopted a two-pronged approach to subversion in the Gulf using
                            its own agents as well as those of the Popular Front for the Liberation
                            of Oman. [<hi rend="italic">7 lines not declassified</hi>]</p>

                        <p>South Yemeni foreign minister Muhammad Salih Muti has made a number of
                            trips to the Gulf in an effort to persuade governments of Qatar, the
                            United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to establish diplomatic relations with
                            Aden. Any South Yemeni embassies opened as a result of Muti’s efforts
                            are likely to be used not only by South Yemeni intelligence but by the
                            Aden supported Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PFLO_1">PFLO</gloss> is another major vehicle for
                            South Yemeni subversive activities in the Gulf. Although the
                            organization has dropped “Arab Gulf” from its name, it still maintains
                            cells and conducts operations in various Gulf states. Aden feared its
                            campaign to gain diplomatic recognition from Gulf states would be
                            hampered if the then “Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman and the
                            Arab Gulf” continued to advocate the overthrow of present Gulf
                            governments.</p>

                        <p>1. Department has carefully considered your account of Asnag’s remarks
                            and your recommendations of what we should do re <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>’s stated intention to accept
                            substantial new military aid from Soviets. We share concern over adverse
                            effect on prospects for stability in South Arabian/Lower Red Sea area
                            from reintroduction of significant Soviet influence in North Yemen;
                            also, over potential serious damage to North Yemen’s relations with
                            Saudi Arabia. We agree that urgent effort should be made to deter <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> from this step. Believe there are

                            itself be first to inform <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> of its

                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> and to reinforce our many efforts to

                            on proposed collaboration under which <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> would finance purchase of US weapons for North Yemen,

                        <p>2. You should seek early meeting with Asnag and say you have been

                            follows to Asnag’s account to you on July 3 of <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss>’s intention to announce on July 9 that President

                            its concern over effect of <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>’s
                            intended action. We appreciate <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>’s

                                >SAG</gloss> response to concrete proposals which have been made by

                            our three governments in supplying arms to North Yemen. We have placed
                            substantial importance on those proposals (and continue to do so) on
                            following grounds: (a) need to bolster North Yemen’s defensive
                            capability and support <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>’s efforts
                            to devise and support well-balanced overall program for the country’s
                            development; (b) stimulus it would provide to enhanced cooperation
                            between North Yemen and Saudi Arabia, in conviction that good relations
                            between them are essential to security of both countries and to broader
                            outlook for peace and progressive development in the South Arabian
                            region; and (c) desirability of limiting the opportunities available to
                            the Soviet Union to increase its presence and influence in the region, a
                            view which we have believed to be fully consistent with <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>’s own concerns over the implications
                            of continued Soviet strength in <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>
                            and elsewhere in the region.</p>
                        <p>3. You should go on that, despite our understanding of <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>’s frustration over <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s dilatoriness in acting on our
                            pending proposals, we were greatly disappointed to learn that it now

                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Such step will inevitably, in our
                            belief, result in sharp adverse reaction in Saudi Arabia, tending
                            probably to confirm in Saudi minds the lingering suspicions which some
                            Saudi leaders have continued to have over <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> intentions. Saudis will be rightly concerned over
                            renewal and expansion of Soviet military involvement in North Yemen. We
                            wonder how this might affect Saudi economic assistance to North Yemen.
                            We also wonder how other friendly Arab states now providing financial
                            help to North Yemen may react. Has <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> taken this adequately into consideration?</p>
                        <p>4. You should refer to Asnag’s statement to you that he is certain no one
                            in Washington will criticize <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> for
                            accepting Soviet offer of arms. So far as <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> is concerned, we fully accept that what it does on this
                            matter is a decision for the <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> to
                            make. We do not question that at all. But decisions like this also
                            entail a concurrent responsibility for the effects of the decision, and
                            such a major policy shift cannot fail to have effects despite best
                            wishes and efforts of all concerned to avoid them. You have been
                            instructed to convey to <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> that
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would regret a decision to
                            bring Soviets back in force in military sphere in North Yemen. <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> should be in no doubt about
                            that.</p>
                        <p>5. We do appreciate Asnag’s informing us in advance. In spirit of the
                            very friendly relationship between our two governments, we wish to take
                            this opportunity to urge <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> to
                            inform <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> urgently and fully, if it
                            has not already done so, concerning its proposed new military
                            relationship with <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. If <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>’s intention is not conveyed directly
                            to Saudis before it becomes a fact, they are likely to react even more
                            sharply than otherwise and we believe they would have legitimate <pb
                                facs="0734" n="699" xml:id="pg_699"/> reason to do so. We have read
                            into Asnag’s remarks to you a suggestion that <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> take the lead in informing <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> of dilemma facing <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> and what <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> plans
                            to do by its announcement on July 9. We believe strongly that it
                            preferable for <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> to convey the
                            message to <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> in first instance. You
                            should add that, once <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> has heard
                            story directly from <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>, we will be
                            prepared to follow up as appropriate with <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> concerning our pending proposals for three-way
                            collaboration in arms supply, including prompt delivery of an initial
                            package to provide early evidence of effectiveness of such
                            collaboration.</p>
                        <p>6. If Asnag responds that failure to get <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> agreement on dates of high-level visits by <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> officials stands in way of informing
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> before July 9, you should
                            convey our belief that (a) <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> can
                            find some way to communicate the necessary message to <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>, and that (b) in any event, proposed
                            July 9 announcement should not repeat not be made before <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> has adequate opportunity to discuss
                            matter with <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>. Seems to us that what
                            is at stake is sufficiently important for <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> not to be bound by short and arbitrary deadline.</p>
                        <p>7. At your discretion, especially if you believe it important to
                            emphasize import of your instructions as contained herein, you are
                            authorized to (a) inform Asnag that you would like very early
                            opportunity to discuss this matter also with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName>, or (b) to seek appointment
                            directly with <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>8. Begin <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>: We are puzzled by some
                            aspects of Asnag’s démarche to you. It is inconsistent with pattern of
                            recent <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> actions and statements to
                            you, including (a) DepCINC’s Cairo interview, (b) Asnag’s broad plan to
                            influence <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>, as reported in Sana
                            1487, and (c) <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName>’s apparently
                            cordial reception in Saudi Arabia in May and in his tour of other
                            anti-Communist Gulf states late in June. We therefore wonder if Asnag’s
                            approach may not be power play to force action by us, but agree we
                            cannot take chance he is bluffing and simply ignore it.</p>
                        <p>9. We continue to see substantial reasons for not entering into directly
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>-financed arms supply
                            relationship of any size with <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>.
                            There is at present no <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> funding
                            available for such purpose. We believe there would be substantial
                            congressional opposition to introduction of a new <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> equipment program for <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>—given, among other things, potential
                            availability of funds from <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>’s
                            oil-rich Arab neighbors. We do not, in these circumstances, consider it
                            feasible to try to preempt Soviets through US-funded program. We
                            continue strongly to support three-way collaborative program relying on
                            Saudi funding as the way to do what is needed in this situation. End
                                <gloss target="#t_FYI_1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>10. For Cairo: It occurs to us that Egypt (perhaps through Ashraf

                            might be of some help to <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> in
                            Riyadh in this matter, and that <persName corresp="#p_STJ_1"
                                >Scotes</persName> might suggest to Asnag that <gloss

                        <p>339. Subject: Soviet Arms to Yemen. Ref: Sanaa 293.</p>
                        <p>Summary: Contrary to <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, there
                            may have been no MIG–21’s delivered to <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                                >YAR</gloss> over last weekend.</p>
                        <p>1. Reftel was written after Soviet ship with deck cargo of six MIG–21
                            crates was seen docked in Hodeida by Emboff on 29 January. We assumed
                            these were aircraft which <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName>
                            had twice told us were enroute and which intelligence reports led us to
                            expect.</p>
                        <pb facs="0736" n="701" xml:id="pg_701"/>
                        <p>2. Emboff able monitor unloading of ship much but not all of the time it
                            in port and on his return to Sanaa 31 January he reported that he saw
                            ship depart Hodeida will all six crates on board. He spotted one tracked
                            vehicle being unloaded, apparently some type of artillery tractor or
                            tank recovery vehicle. Subsequently another Emboff, who also in Hodeida
                            on other business, counted five of apparently same type of tracked
                            vehicle. From guides available at post Emboffs cannot positively
                            identify vehicle, but its crane and truck type cabin windows suggest it
                            is tracted, armored engineering, or tank recovery vehicle, not fighting
                            vehicle.</p>
                        <p>2. We could conceiveably have missed unloading of MIG–21’s during first
                            day ship in Hodeida, before Emboff saw it. If so, however, aircraft
                            boxes not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not at Hodeida
                            airport.</p>
                        <p>3. Other crates being unloaded were small, suggesting spare parts and
                            maybe engines and ammo. Volume was not great.</p>
                        <p>4. Emboff sighted some light towed guns, apparently 45mm or 57mm
                            anti-tank type.</p>
                        <p>5. Ship was met by Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ahmed
                                al-Ghashmi</persName> and Soviet military delegation which in

                        <p>Comment: So far as we can tell at the moment, the one shipment to date
                            looks like limited one which <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1"
                                >Hamdi</persName> has been describing to us, Brits, Jordanians, and
                            some Saudis. It certainly too early to close the door on advanced Soviet
                            aircraft and tanks for <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> however. A
                            disgruntled air force officer insists that there is a deal for 12
                            MIG–17’s, 12 MIG–21’s, 4 MI–8 helos and 4 AN–26 transports. He says
                            trainees have left <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> for eight month

                        <p>1. In conversation on February 12 with <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss>

                            <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Abdallah al-Asnaj</persName> Chargé went
                            over, in general way as in <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>,
                            present stage of arms efforts by <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            for <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>. Provided no details, but
                            said I pleased we getting into details of purchases and training. Said
                            Saudi plan was impressive evidence Saudi military professionalism and
                            good will toward <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> said this was good news,
                            which paralleled news from Saudis. He said he was very pleased. He said
                            he had heard Saudis were expediting residence of military mission here.
                            He said Saudi policy had undergone dramatic change, from “search for
                            weak and divided Yemen” to “support for strong and friendly government
                            in Sanaa”. Yemenis expected no less, but were grateful and pleased. They
                            would reciprocate.</p>
                        <p>3. Then, <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> said he wanted to
                            warn <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> about possibility of
                            “setbacks”.</p>
                        <p>4. He said that Yemeni had been in present stage of discussions re arms
                            from Saudis at least twice before, and would have “doubts about anything
                            materializing” until new shipments began actually to arrive. Saudis, he
                            said, moved slowly. <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> pointed
                            to modern 105 mm Howitizers which now Saudis have shipped him. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> nodded and said they came without
                            ammo.</p>
                        <p>5. He also said that <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName>, on
                            his visit to Sudan, had been impressed with Soviet military equipment of
                            most modern sort which is there, apparently without objection from
                            Saudis. <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName>, he said, would
                            see same thing in Egypt later this month on official visit there.</p>
                        <p>6. He then spoke at some length, at first elliptically and then more
                            bluntly, about what he regards as frailities of <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> foreign policy. He <pb facs="0738" n="703"
                                xml:id="pg_703"/> said Congress seemed to be able to check the
                            President, and seemed want to move to alter whole posture of US foreign
                            policy of last two decades. Congressional effort seemed to be supported
                            by national mood in US. Soviets, by contrast, seemed to be willing fill
                            resulting void with redoubled efforts. What was happening in Angola,
                            said <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName>, was likely to happen
                            shortly in Djibouti, after French left. Then Somali forces, well armed
                            and claiming revolutionary and racial motives, would take over with a
                            lot of help from Cubans, North Koreans, North Vietnamese. Cubans and
                            Soviets were strengthening <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, had
                            potential for creating trouble in <gloss target="#t_YAR_1"
                            >YAR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. I said situation in Arabian Peninsula was different. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had proved many times to be dependable
                            friend of <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> also has leading role in Middle East
                            which has made extraordinary successes possible in last several years.
                            Arab friend should not be deceived about debate in US. Our interests in
                            Middle East were clear and would be prosecuted forcefully. Moreover,
                            Saudis had, as <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> himself
                            said, adopted new policy toward Yemen and were now pursuing it with
                            great good will, tenacity and in my view all possible speed. Said that,
                            finally, I assumed no <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> no need tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName>, after his experience
                            in South Yemen, that road to changing and improving situation there was
                            by setting tough conditions and insisting on implementation. Any other
                            kind of accommodation with South, or with its Soviet-supporters did not
                            seem to me to promise anything good for <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> security.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> said he understood this,
                            accepted it. What <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had to realize,
                            he said, was that Yemen was a “liability” to us and Saudis, and would be
                            until it could finance itself. It needed a lot of support. In meantime,
                            it was “not a client”.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> then said he wanted to
                            state once again what he had earlier told Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_STJ_1">Scotes</persName> about Soviet arms deliveries.
                            To make sure he had not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not mislead
                            Ambassador, or been mislead himself, he had “checked matter”. There was
                            no <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> no new arms agreement with
                            Soviets, he said firmly. Nothing had been signed. When Abdal Alim went
                            to Moscow Marshall Grechko staged a dinner at which he, Grechko,
                            produced an arms request which had been previously prepared by Muhsin
                            al-Ayni. Al-Ayni, said <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName>, was
                            always too clever by half. He had sold <gloss target="#t_YARG_1"
                                >YARG</gloss> on idea of very long and sophisticated equipment
                            request on grounds that Soviets would surely reject it. Grechko,
                            however, told Abdal Alim that list was approved. There was condition:
                            Shipments of most new equipment would begin after <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> visited Moscow, even for two
                            days. Meanwhile shipments of old and some new <gloss target="#t_rpt_1"
                                >rpt</gloss> and some new equipment would begin at once.</p>
                        <p>10. When first ship arrived last month from <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, said <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName>,
                            Soviets wanted to make a “big exhibition” of unloading it. <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> refused and Soviets tried get
                            reversal. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName> went down to
                            Hodeida <pb facs="0739" n="704" xml:id="pg_704"/> and told Soviets
                            either to unload it or move it, as it blocking port. Finally, after
                            things unloaded, Soviets moved ship.</p>
                        <p>11. According to <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> Ambassador, who saw
                                <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> immediately after me,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> story was slightly
                            different. Ship contained two cargoes, one for Yemen with old stuff and
                            one other cargo which eventually went elsewhere but which Soviets wanted
                            to show Yemenis (Mig–21s, T–54’s) and somehow suggested they would
                            unload in port if Yemenis wanted. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1"
                                >Ghashmi</persName> said unload it or move the ship. Soviets moved
                            the ship, <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> thought to
                            Aden.</p>
                        <p>12. I probably didn’t get this story because I did not <gloss
                                target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not inquire about MIG–21’s or other
                            new equipment, per instructions. I did say, however, such items had
                            double importance. First, they were symbols of Soviet role and military
                            prowess of <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss>. Friends of Yemen were
                            interested in both. In addition, they were litmus test of <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> credibility. We had been told
                            clearly and repeatedly that these items not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1"
                                >rpt</gloss> not now coming. If they arrived, question of confidence
                            would be created. We hoped to be told in advance if <gloss
                                target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> expectations changed. As potential
                            arms supplier, we needed and wanted completely frank and clear
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> did not demur, and said
                            only he was reporting facts as he knew them.</p>
                        <p>14. Comment: Although talk touched frankly on some sensitive

                            warm and self-possessed as ever. I think he is telling us truth as he
                            knows it.</p>
                        <p>15. However, we now have four stories about the Soviet arms deal.</p>
                        <p>16. First, as <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Asnaj</persName> tells it,
                            there is no deal, and the only things coming are old things. Second, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName> tells it, the Soviets
                            sent MIG–21’s and tanks but at last minute they refused deliver them
                            because of suspicion and anger re Saudi military mission. Third, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> telling Saudis,
                            (according to <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> embassy here, which
                            asked to check story) the new equipment arrived but <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> told them to carry it away.
                                (<gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> Embassy has given Saudis very
                            qualified indication that latter may be true.) Fourth, we have
                            unilateral <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> reports that agreements
                            for massive shipments are signed, the equipment is on its way or
                            scheduled for delivery, the first ship brought no more and no less than
                            expected.</p>
                        <p>17. I have held this report in hopes that in last four days, we could
                            come up with more or better information which would allow us make
                            informed guess about the four stories above. So far, that still remains
                            only a hope. I think we should ask for Saudi views.</p>
                        <p>18. In any case, Soviets are I think at least as unsure of their footing
                            and the facts here as we are, and I am convinced that we can turn off
                                <pb facs="0740" n="705" xml:id="pg_705"/> or reduce flow of military

                            lead from the Egyptians, the Saudi Royal Family is not united in its
                            approach. Prince <persName corresp="#p_FIAS_1">Fahd</persName> leads
                            those Saudis who believe that the current <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> leadership can be won over with Saudi goodwill and
                            financial assistance. At the very least, they assert that the prospect
                            of eliminating <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> subversion merits
                            the limited risks. With King <persName corresp="#p_KIAS_1"
                                >Khalid</persName>’s concurrence, this faction has won out.</p>
                        <p>Other important Saudis, however, regard the current Marxist regime in
                            Aden as hopelessly hostile. Prince Sultan, a dominant force in
                            Saudi-Yemeni relations, has opposed any approach to <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> on the grounds that the Aden regime
                            is on the point of collapse because of its own economic and political
                            ineptitude. Hence, a Saudi hand in friendship will only keep in power an
                            essentially dangerous regime that will never moderate its radical views.
                            Sultan and his colleagues argue, therefore, that confrontation is the
                            only sensible policy toward Communist <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"

                            Leaders in Aden have also been divided on the question of moderating
                            policies and improving relations with Saudi Arabia. To many, including
                            National Front Secretary General Isma’il, Saudi Arabia remains the core
                            of reactionary forces in the Arabian Peninsula. In 1969, <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>’s revolutionary zeal led to a border
                            conflict with the Saudis, who continue to maintain a <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> exile army on Aden’s northern
                            border. Under such circumstances, the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> hardliners have opposed any rapprochement with the
                            Saudis.</p>
                        <p>President Ali, who is the leading “moderate” on the issue, has overcome
                            opposition and convinced a majority of the government that the survival
                            of the regime depends upon accommodation with the Saudis. President Ali
                            asserts that:</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Serious Problems Remain</hi>. Although the March 10
                            announcement was a significant first step toward the “normalization” of
                            relations, difficult problems remain. It will not be easy to overcome
                            deeply ingrained mutual suspicions. Moreover, it is possible that
                            hardliners, especially in <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>, could
                            gain the upper hand and cancel further negotiations. Isma’il has used
                            his position to put his supporters in important positions throughout the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> power structure. They can be
                            counted on to fight a continuing rearguard action.</p>
                        <p>The greatest problem, however, is that each state has implicitly
                            committed others whom they do not control. Although the Adenis have
                            ended support for the Omani rebels, controlling them will be more
                            difficult. Furthermore, the rebels’ international supporters may not be
                            prepared to see all raids into Oman stopped. Convincing the Soviet
                            Union, Iraq, and Libya that the Adenis are not selling out the rebels
                            for Saudi money will be difficult. Similarly, any attempt by <gloss
                                target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> to reduce Soviet or other Communist
                            presence will be met with stiff resistence.</p>
                        <p>The Saudis were even more generous than the Adenis in speaking for
                            others. The Saudis committed the Sultan of Oman to curtail further
                            reconnaissance flights over <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss>’s
                            Sixth Governorate in exchange for the end of <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"
                                >PDRY</gloss> shelling of Omani territory. In addition, the Saudis
                            implicitly agreed to the eventual withdrawal of Iranian soldiers from
                            Oman. Neither the Omanis nor the Iranians have made any such
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>In the past, Sultan Qabus has complained of not having been consulted by
                            the Saudis. Aware of Omani concerns, Prince Saud, the Saudi Foreign

                            policy study of Gulf area now in progress. We find ourselves in somewhat
                            of a chicken-and-egg situation: Our “requirements” for Masirah will in
                            part depend on whether other locations are available for certain
                            activities; the suitability of Masirah, as compared with alternative
                            locations, will depend in part on the nature of the British presence
                            remaining on the island. We had thus far identified two specific US
                            security interests: (a) the occasional use of Masirah airfield by US
                            logistical and maritime patrol aircraft for refueling, with perhaps one
                            or two landings a month, and no US personnel stationed on the island;
                            (b) [<hi rend="italic">3½ lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>4. In response to question about who would maintain airstrip if <gloss
                                target="#t_RAF_1">RAF</gloss> withdrawn, Muir thought that the
                            Omanis themselves would take over the operation, probably with technical
                            assistance of British contract civilians. <gloss target="#t_HMG_1"
                                >HMG</gloss> plans to turn over all “non-warlike surplus” matériel
                            to Omani Government. In ensuing discussion <persName corresp="#p_PS_1"
                                >Palmer</persName> asked to what extent the cost factor was a
                            determinant in <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss>’s consideration of
                            withdrawal. Muir said reasons for “decision” to withdraw were (a)
                            consonance with 1975 defense review conclusions, and (b) end of Dhofar
                            war which made withdrawal possible in terms of <gloss target="#t_UK_2"
                                >UK</gloss>-Omani relations.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_PS_1">Palmer</persName> said in light of our
                            current study <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could not
                            definitively state its interest in Masirah at this time. Therefore we
                            wondered if <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> could delay approach to
                            Qaboos for a few weeks. By end of May, hopefully before, <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would have official position on
                            Masirah to discuss with <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss>. Meanwhile,
                            the time had obviously come to begin to “think out loud together.”

                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> intent is to take down British flag on
                            Masirah. He opined <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> would still want
                            to talk this month to Qaboos about “decision” to withdraw. <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> Embassy would, of course, convey our
                            request to London. In this context Muir noted that annual US–<gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> “Gulf talks” were being scheduled in
                            Washington late April.</p>

                            facilities on island, Millington said <gloss target="#t_HMG_1"

                        <p>7. Churchill asked about reports that British were expanding water
                            desalinization and power facilities on Masirah. Muir said he had no
                            direct information, but was under impression that such projects were
                            strictly within context of technical assistance to Oman.</p>

                        <p>9. Molineaux sought British views on possibility of Iranian or Jordanian
                            involvement on Masirah, and how Omani Government might view this. Muir
                            said he would seek <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss>’s thoughts on
                            this, and noted that <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> was
                            considering when to tell the Shah about withdrawal from Masirah.</p>
                        <p>10. Muir asked how strong a <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> request
                            for a delay (before the British talked with the Sultan) we would like

                            said we “strongly hoped” <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> would find
                            it possible to delay a while, for informing Qaboos at this time could
                            complicate our now-urgent policy approach to Masirah and related
                            matters. In response to Muir’s “hypothetical” questions about <gloss

                            seeking to persuade <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> to retain <gloss
                                target="#t_RAF_1">RAF</gloss> presence, <persName corresp="#p_PS_1"
                                >Palmer</persName> indicated that at this juncture we wanted to keep
                            all reasonable options open. When <persName corresp="#p_PS_1"
                                >Palmer</persName> again evinced interest in relevance of cost
                            factor, Muir deemed it not very significant. Muir stressed that
                            withdrawal decision had been made at Ministerial level, and reaction to
                            our request for delay probably would have to be considered at that
                            level. He asked if we would have clearer view of our interest in Masirah
                            to discuss with Weir at forthcoming Gulf talks. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PS_1">Palmer</persName> deemed it unlikely that review
                            and discussion process on the related policy study would have been
                            completed by then, but we should have a better fix on the
                            Masirah-related aspects.</p>

                            representatives on April 6. The results are summarized in the message at

                            off with the notification until we could complete our study. They told
                            us that the decision had been taken at the Ministerial level but agreed
                            to wait until after our annual talks with the <gloss target="#t_UK_2"
                                >UK</gloss> on the Gulf (April 22 and 23), although holding out
                            little hope of a change of mind or a long delay (Tab C) and suggesting
                            that we negotiate directly with Oman on any future <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> use, as was the pattern with Bahrain
                            after the <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> withdrew there.</p>
                        <p>At the meeting I chaired on April 6 there was full agreement that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should find a means of
                            preserving its option of using Masirah occasionally, particularly for
                            P–3 flights. This can be done in one of several ways, ranging from the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> continuing to operate the base as
                            in the past (virtually precluded), through our aiding the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> financially (doubtful the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> would agree to stay, even on this basis)
                            to other arrangements which need to be clarified (e.g. having the
                            airfield remain open under Omani Government control, presumably with
                            some sort of contract service; Iranian and/or Jordanian or Saudi
                            participation along with Oman in running the airfield; <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> participation in running the airfield;
                            using Salalah airfield in Oman—still run by the <gloss target="#t_RAF_1"
                                >RAF</gloss>—as an alternative to Masirah). State and <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> will explore all possible <pb
                                facs="0748" n="713" xml:id="pg_713"/> alternatives with the <gloss

                            clear idea of what is possible by the end of the talks.</p>
                        <p>Finally, State has before the Secretary a memo—which I cleared for <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>—explaining the problem of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> notification of Oman and recommending
                            that he either send a message to Prime Minister Callaghan or take up
                            with Foreign Minister Crossland a request that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> wait another few weeks until the <gloss

                            Masirah. This would strengthen our position for the talks with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_2">UK</gloss> tomorrow and Friday.</p>
                        <p>No matter which alternative we may reach—assuming we do wish to have the

                            faced with the need to negotiate an agreement with Oman and will
                            probably have to consult Congress on what we are doing. Neither of these
                            is an insurmountable problem, but both will make our life more difficult

                            had gone extremely well, had resulted in cancellation of “agreements”
                            with <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and had opened new page in
                                <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> relations with Saudi Arabia and
                            by extension with the US. End summary.</p>
                        <pb facs="0749" n="714" xml:id="pg_714"/>
                        <p>2. During week that followed departure of Prince Sultan rumors began to
                            proliferate in Sana that discussions had bogged down and visit had
                            yielded no tangible results in military assistance field. Additional
                            reports circulated to effect that large number of <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> military personnel including
                            paratroopers had begun new training cycle in <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and that local Soviet mission had been very active
                            following Sultan visit. Usually well informed civilian and military
                            officials at mid to upper levels expressed pessimism in talks with US
                            Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_DATT_1">DATT</gloss> and one highly
                            placed <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> source predicted that
                                Soviet-<gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> ties would continue on
                            expanded basis.</p>
                        <p>3. In contest of these rumors Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_DATT_1"
                                >DATT</gloss> visited <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> Deputy
                            CINC/Chief of Staff <gloss target="#t_LTC_1">LTC</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ahmad al-Ghashmi</persName> on 21 April and
                            asked for his assessment of Sultan visit. Latter responded immediately
                            and positively that full agreement had been reached on all major
                            questions of military assistance. He went on to say that the Saudis had
                            reconfirmed their intention to finance Western military equipment
                            largely of US manufacture though in some cases from France. The
                            Ambassador mentioned that we had sent letters of offer for military
                            equipment by special courier to Riyadh for Saudi review prior to
                            Sultan’s visit to <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> and asked if
                            these had been presented to Yemenis. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1"
                                >Ghashmi</persName> answered that he himself would travel to Riyadh
                            within the next month to sign these letters.</p>
                        <p>4. In the meantime, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName> said,
                            Saudis and Yemenis had agreed on formation of joint military
                            committee—headed by <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName>
                            himself on <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> side and on Saudi side
                            by Colonel Falih al-Dhahiri, G–3 Action Officer for Saudi programs in
                                <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1"
                                >Ghashmi</persName> noted that Dhahiri had arrived on previous day
                            April 20 at head of Saudi follow-up team which would begin process of
                            implementing reorganization plans previously developed by Saudi Ministry
                            of Defense and Aviation.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador explained that we had heard rumors in Sana of difficulties
                            or misunderstandings during the Sultan talks together with stories of
                            large-scale Soviet offers of equipment and training. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName> dismissed these rumors as lies
                            and attributed them to “party factionalists” (hazibiyiin) seeking to sow
                            doubt and discord. He confirmed that the Soviet Ambassador had been to
                            see him on three successive days with offers of military hardware
                            including T–55 tanks and 1,300 training spaces in the Soviet Union but
                            assured his listeners that he had refused these proposals. He went on to
                            say that <gloss target="#t_YARG_1">YARG</gloss> had cancelled
                            “agreements” with <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and was hoping
                            to terminate the entire relationship.</p>
                        <p>6. By way of further clarification, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1"
                                >Ghashmi</persName> explained that the preceding information was
                            extremely closely held. Agreements and decisions during the Sultan visit
                            had been reached behind closed doors at meetings restricted to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> and himself on the
                                <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> side. <pb facs="0750" n="715"
                                xml:id="pg_715"/> He assured the Ambassador that <persName
                                corresp="#p_HIM_1">Hamdi</persName> would reiterate the above
                            information during the Ambassador’s next call on the <gloss
                                target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss> President.</p>
                        <p>7. In closing, <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName> agreed with
                            the Ambassador that this was truly the dawn of a new era in Yemeni
                            international relations. He did say, however, that the next four months
                            would be crucial. He considered it vitally important that some major and
                            eyecatching items of military equipment arrive in Yemen before the end
                            of the summer. He concluded by saying he now believed that the Saudis
                            were sincere in their desire to move forward with a military assistance
                            program for Yemen.</p>
                        <p>Comment: 1. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName>’s comments had
                            ring of truth throughout. Reasons for the nose-hold which he and
                            President have placed on military agreements allegedly reached with
                            Saudis are obscure. Possibility exists that despite his remark
                            concerning cancellation of “agreements” with <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> he is not ready to burn bridges openly with Moscow
                            until he has significant quantities of Western equipment in hand.
                            Additional possibility exists that Saudis for reasons of their own have
                            imposed black-out on military assistance decisions until appropriate
                            later date, perhaps when <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName>
                            visits Riyadh to sign letters of offer. Would appreciate any light which
                            Embassy Jidda may be able to shed on this matter.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Ghashmi</persName>’s allusion to
                            “agreements” with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> implies
                            that some type of written understanding was reached between the two
                            countries at an earlier date. It was not clear, however, whether he was
                            referring to a specific undertaking (such as the alleged agreement
                            signed, initialed, or negotiated by Abdul Alim last November) or whether
                            he was using the word as a generic term to denote the historic military
                            relationship between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_YAR_1">YAR</gloss>. On balance latter seems more
                            likely in context of his hopes (so often expressed before) that the
                            Soviet connection would come to an early end.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Joe:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>(S) The British have agreed to postpone notifying the Sultan of Oman of
                            their intention to withdraw from the <gloss target="#t_RAF_1"
                                >RAF</gloss> facility on Masirah Island until after the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers Conference in
                            Oslo. In preparation for the discussions in Oslo, I would like to
                            reiterate the interest of the Department of Defense in retaining access
                            to the facilities on Masirah Island [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>(S) The <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> interest is to assure access
                            to air facilities for maritime surveillance aircraft operating in the
                            northwest Indian Ocean. This is a primary area of Soviet naval activity,
                            and it is too far from Diego Garcia to permit effective search
                            operations to be conducted from there. Our use of alternative
                            facilities, e.g., Bandar Abbas or Karachi, is restricted due to
                            political constraints, and the potential availability of an airfield on
                            Masirah would considerably enhance the flexibility of air operations in
                            this important region.</p>
                        <p>(S) [<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (7 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>(S) The most desirable solution from the viewpoint of the Department of
                            Defense would be for the British to continue to operate the <gloss
                                target="#t_RAF_1">RAF</gloss> facility on the island, even if only
                            on a “bare bones” basis. We would be prepared to discuss with the
                            British financial or other arrangements which might assist them in
                            maintaining their presence at reduced levels of expenditure. However,
                            talks with British representatives below the Cabinet level have revealed
                            little interest in a cost-sharing formula, since the decision to
                            withdraw is based primarily on a political desire to terminate their
                            defense commitments East of Suez.</p>
                        <p>(S) The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is in the process of
                            completing the naval and air support facilities at Berbera. The
                            availability of the airfield there in particular may lead to a change in
                            the nature and overall capabilities of Soviet military operations in the
                            northwest Indian Ocean. We believe <pb facs="0752" n="717"
                                xml:id="pg_717"/> this would be the wrong time for the British to
                            relinquish the air [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] facilities on Masirah, and I recommend that they
                            be urged to postpone their withdrawal for at least two years.</p>
                        <p>(S) If the British cannot be persuaded to reverse their decision, we
                            would require at a minimum that an operational facility of some form
                            continue to be available on Masirah. It is our understanding that the
                            Sultan has indicated his interest in establishing a flying school at the
                            airfield—probably with British contract assistance—[<hi rend="italic">2
                                lines not declassified</hi>]. Although operation of the airfield
                            under Omani auspices would be much less satisfactory than a continued
                                <gloss target="#t_RAF_1">RAF</gloss> presence, it is in our
                            interests to insure that any British negotiations with the Sultan be
                            conducted with at least the minimum objective of preserving the
                            operational capability of the airfield, with the understanding that we
                            would wish to undertake direct discussions with the Sultan of Oman
                            concerning future <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> access

                        <p>While in Sana during my recent trip to the Middle East, I met with the

                                al-Ghashmi</persName>. Our discussions, which covered a broad range
                            of subjects, indicated a strong Yemeni desire for expanded <gloss

                        <p>In my opinion, the Yemeni desire for closer alignment with the programs
                            would provide them a potential counterbalance to significant numbers of
                            Yemenis already trained in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as

                        <p>I fully support the Yemeni requests for increased training and education
                            as reasonable and worthy of your personal attention. In this regard, we

                            training which will be required for the Yemenis to assimilate recent

                            million, but Yemenis are refusing to pay any of Soviet and East Bloc
                            debt. Balance of trade will be minus $360 million. But balance of
                            payments (current accounts and transfers) will show a favorable balance
                            of $80 million. The answer, of course, is $600 million in remittances
                            from Yemenis working in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.
                            This asset constitutes the country’s chief prop and one of the
