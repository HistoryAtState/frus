                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts that contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list type="simple">
                        <label>a.</label>

                        <p>In his discussion on other subjects with the Secretary General this
                            morning, Amb. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> referred to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s proposed
                            preface to the repertory of U.N. practice. He recalled that the
                            Secretary General proposed to say that in view of all the circumstances,
                            he found valid arguments for a decision at the 10th Session of the
                            General Assembly in favor of a Charter Review Conference but leaving
                            open for the time being the question of when the conference should be
                            convened.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> indicated that he
                            thought it was undesirable for the Secretary General to take any stand
                            at the present on the question of charter review which might be regarded
                            as negative. We were in favor of a Charter Review Conference and we did
                            not wish to see developing a negative attitude.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> said that he did
                            not feel his reference to the Charter Review Conference in his proposed
                                preface<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">Telegram 779 from New York, May
                                13, reported that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                                supplied the Mission with a draft text “of preface to repertory of
                                practice of United Nations” designed to defer a Charter review
                                meeting by at least 1 year. <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                    >Hammarskjöld</persName> argued that deferral would “fit into US
                                election schedule” and might also avoid “all-out Soviet opposition
                                Charter review.” The text of this preface was transmitted in
                                telegram 780 from New York, May 13. (Both Department of State,
                                Central Files, 310.1/5–1355)</note> would be taken as negative. Its
                            purpose was simply to get the idea abroad that the time for the
                            conference was still an open question. He feared that there was a
                            certain amount of sentiment developing which took for granted that a
                            conference would be called immediately. He was <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2"
                                facs="0028"/>aware that the United States did not favor an immediate
                            conference and thought that his remarks fitted into our viewpoint. He
                            had real doubts about what a Charter Review Conference could accomplish
                            and feared that issues would be raised which would be highly
                            controversial and unprofitable to discuss. It was clear that his general
                            feeling was negative to the idea of a conference.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> again expressed his
                            view that it was desirable to stimulate interest in a conference and
                            that a report by the Secretary General now favoring even in general
                            terms deferment would not have the desired effect.</p>

                        <p>850. Re Charter review. <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName>
                            (UK) called on me today to discuss, among other things, Foreign Office’s
                            instructions concerning Charter review. These instructions have gone out
                            to all UK posts in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The UK is opposed to taking any definite decision at the 10th <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> concerning the convening of a Charter
                            review conference. They hope that the outcome of the discussions at the
                            next session will show the Charter to be sufficiently flexible as is.
                            They would probably accept a decision only to the effect that the 11th
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> should decide the question of
                            whether to convene the conference.</p>
                        <p>UK Delegation pointed out, without in any way committing themselves or
                            even advocating it, that, if there are any parts of the Charter on which
                            there is hope of adopting amendments, the procedures in Article 108 of
                            the Charter<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">Article 108 of the U.N. Charter
                                reads: “Amendments to the present Charter shall come into force for
                                all Members of the United Nations when they have been adopted by a
                                vote of two thirds of the members of the General Assembly and
                                ratified in accordance with their respective constitutional
                                processes by two thirds of the Members of the United Nations,
                                including all the permanent members of the Security Council.”</note>
                            could be used. Their interpretation of this article is that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, in regular session, could put forward an
                            amendment to the Charter by a ⅔ vote. This would, of course, have to be
                            followed by normal ratification processes. They believe such a procedure
                            is better suited for achieving specific objectives, such as change in
                            procedure for admission of new members or for increasing the size of the
                            Security Council. They regard it as definitely undesirable to open up
                            the whole Charter for discussion at this time and presumably in the
                            foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>The UK missions in all of the member countries are also instructed to try
                            to discourage representatives from raising the question of Charter
                            review in their speeches at San Francisco. They have some doubts about
                            the success of this operation but they intend to make a good try at
                            it.</p>
                        <p>As I told <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName>, it is obvious
                            that we are quite far apart on this question. On thinking over the UK
                            idea, it seems to me they miss the whole point of our position which is
                            that it is possible on certain issues to build up so much pressure in
                            world opinion that the Soviets are less likely to veto a particular
                            amendment. Under the UK suggestion for Article 108 procedure, to which
                            they do not commit <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0030"/>themselves, you
                            could not achieve such a build up of pressure. The Article 108 procedure
                            would, in fact, prevent the maximum use of public opinion forces. It
                            would leave the Soviet attitude to be determined solely on the basis of
                            the more regular forces at play during an assembly session.</p>
                        <p>I intend at next opportunity to ask British point blank whether they
                            would stand with us on revision of membership requirements under Article
                            108 procedure as they suggested. When they reject this proposal in
                            addition to turning us down on Charter review, they should be feeling at
                            least slightly penitent and they may just be willing to go along on

                        <p>It will be recalled that under Article 109 of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Charter, the proposal to call a review conference is
                            automatically on the agenda of the tenth General Assembly when it
                            convenes this September. At the San Francisco Conference in 1945, many
                            states, disturbed by the major-power veto, attached great importance to
                            this Charter provision, but such few expressions of opinion as have come
                            to the <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0031"/>Department’s attention to
                            date do not indicate a comparable reaction today. For example,
                            Australia, a strong supporter of this provision at San Francisco, has
                            approached us and is, we understand, approaching Canada, France, the
                            Netherlands, the UK, and New Zealand to express doubts about a decision
                            at this time to hold a conference.</p>
                        <p>In this country there is widespread public interest in the question of a
                            review conference. A Senate subcommittee has been holding hearings on
                            the question for the past year, and both the Secretary and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> have stated publicly
                            that we favor a review conference. Most recently, on May 3, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> told the Senate
                            subcommittee: “…<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">Ellipsis in the source
                                text.</note> the United States should support the holding of a
                            Charter Review Conference. A Charter Review Conference held at the
                            proper time is necessary.” In January of last year, the Secretary stated
                            before the same subcommittee that “the United States expects to favor
                            the holding of such a review conference.”</p>
                        <p>Under Article 109, a decision to hold a review conference is to be taken
                            at the tenth General Assembly by a majority vote and by a vote of any
                            seven members of the Security Council. Therefore, with a view to
                            sounding out the Foreign Office’s position on this question and
                            explaining ours, the Mission is requested, unless it perceives
                            objections, to discuss informally with the Foreign Office the statements
                            of the Secretary and of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> quoted above. It should point out that Article 109
                            speaks of “reviewing”, not of “revising”, the Charter, and emphasize
                            that it is a review conference, which may or may not lead to revision,
                            that we have in mind. The Secretary himself has warned against any
                            attempt to rewrite the Charter, and has stated that the “United Nations
                            as it is, is better than no United Nations at all.” The Mission should
                            also indicate that it is our belief that a review conference offers
                            possibilities of accomplishment—first, through procedural agreements
                            which would not involve the amending process, and second, through
                            agreement on a limited number of amendments, which the <gloss
                                target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> might be induced to ratify by
                            the force of world opinion in support of them.</p>
                        <p>Specifically what in our view these agreements or amendments should be we
                            are not yet prepared to say, and we would expect that other governments
                            are in a similar position at this stage. Later, however, we anticipate
                            extensive consultations on any proposals we might wish to make and, we
                            would hope, on any proposals that others might be considering. In this
                            way useless and perhaps disruptive public debate of proposals that fail
                            of general acceptability might be avoided.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0032"/>
                        <p>It is also our belief that the review process itself could increase
                            general understanding and support of the United Nations by making clear,
                            on the one hand, the flexibility and potentialities of the Charter as it
                            stands and, on the other, the limits beyond which sovereign states are
                            still unwilling to go in undertaking multilateral commitments.</p>
                        <p>If the question arises of what we consider to be the “proper time”
                            mentioned by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>,
                            the Mission should indicate that we have not yet taken a position on
                            timing; that we regard this as a matter for the General Assembly to
                            decide and that, in so doing, the latter will presumably take into
                            account the time required to prepare for a conference. <gloss
                                target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. The Secretary has indicated that he

                        <p>In addition to any indications of whether the Foreign Office attitude is
                            favorable, neutral, or unfavorable to a decision by the tenth General
                            Assembly to hold a review conference, and of how firm this attitude is,
                            the Department would, of course, be interested in any views the Foreign
                            Office may have on the exact nature of possible Assembly action and on
                            the timing of a conference. The Department would also be interested in
                            receiving the Mission’s estimate of the amount of local public interest
                            in a Charter review conference.</p>

                        <p>80. Re Charter review. <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> finds
                            reaction here to holding of Charter review conference lukewarm even
                            among those favoring conference, while many others have not yet adopted
                            any policy, preferring to await further developments. There is growing
                            tendency, stimulated in part by countries such as UK who oppose
                            conference, to view it with skepticism. If unchecked, this trend could
                            make it almost impossible to get support for our position when question
                            comes up in Assembly.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> efforts to date have met with
                            following criticisms: <list>

                                <item>US position is too vague with reference to nature of action
                                    conference should take. A large number of members have asked us
                                    what proposals we have to offer other than Ambassador <persName
                                        corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s suggestion re
                                    membership veto. This latter proposal is not considered
                                    sufficient justification in itself for a conference since
                                    Russian agreement to the amendment would constitute agreement to
                                    a majority vote on membership.</item>

                                <item>US position not sufficiently specific re timing of conference.
                                    Delegations ask whether we would support <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                        >SYG</gloss> ’s proposal. Although <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8"
                                        facs="0034"/>we have stated that we are flexible as to time,
                                    other delegations have not been put at ease by these
                                    statements.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In view of fact that many <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members are
                            not yet firm in their positions but are beginning to question
                            advisability of conference, it would seem that the only way to
                            counteract any tendency to oppose conference would be by US adoption of
                            more definitive position. Therefore, I request that the Department
                            consider taking such steps as an announcement of at least one or two
                            specific proposals which have a chance of success, and the setting of a
                            specific date for the conference. Department may question an early
                            announcement on ground that it jeopardizes the position, but refraining
                            from doing so may, under present circumstances, make it impossible for
                            us to have a conference at all.</p>
                        <p>Re date of conference, we could set either a specific date or support
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s proposal in order to make
                            clear to everyone that we are not pushing for an early conference.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> urges that some action along the
                            lines indicated be taken promptly unless the Department has reservations
                            about its position favoring a conference.</p>

                                reassessing its position on Charter review with particular reference
                                to the membership question, which was regarded as the crucial
                                substantive issue. Should means be found to break the existing
                                deadlock over membership the Department might not be disposed to
                                press for an early Charter review conference. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, 310.1/8–355)</note> which reflects the upshot of a
                            long meeting held yesterday with the Secretary to discuss the subjects
                            of Charter review and membership (including non-member participation).
                            During that meeting (at which <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Fran
                                Wilcox</persName> was also present) the Secretary made it quite
                            clear that he regards membership <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0035"/>as
                            the key problem presently confronting the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, and that his thinking on the question of a Charter
                            review conference is largely conditioned by his estimate of the
                            necessity or utility of such a conference in helping to break the
                            present membership deadlock, which he fears is progressively strangling
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, he decided to hold up a telegram which we had drafted,
                            setting forth a clear position on the Charter review conference question
                            to be negotiated with the British and French, pending further
                            exploration of possible solutions to the membership impasse. In this
                            connection, the Secretary now appears to be thinking in terms of a broad
                            package deal including virtually all outstanding applicants, plus Spain
                            but with the exception of the divided states and certain of the more
                            flagrant of the satellites. I need hardly say that this information
                            should be very closely and carefully held until there has been further
                            opportunity to explore the possibilities.<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3">A
                                handwritten notation at this point in the source text reads: “Caveat

                        <p>I am sorry that we have been unable to provide you with any more concrete
                            guidance on Charter review, but that is the way it has worked out. I did
                            not at yesterday’s meeting sense any strong feeling on the part of the
                            Secretary that we should press ahead for a specific decision by the
                            Tenth Session to hold a Charter review conference at a predetermined
                            time and place if in fact the prevailing sentiment of the other Members
                            is against such a decision. On the other hand, he did seem favorably
                            disposed toward the idea of establishing a “preparatory commission” of
                            some sort to give continuing consideration to the feasibility of
                            convening such a conference, as well as to the possible time, place, and
                            terms of reference thereof. From what we know of the Interim Report of
                            the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee on the subject of Charter
                            review, they would appear to be similarly disposed.</p>
                        <p>I might add that the consensus of the meeting appeared to be clearly in
                            favor of deferring any further discussion of the non-member
                            participation idea until after we have explored more thoroughly the
                            chances of achieving a break in the membership deadlock.</p>

                                have subsequently been proposed for inclusion in the supplementary
                                agenda which will be circulated by the Secretary General not later
                                than August 31. Bracketed questions may be proposed for
                                consideration as separate items or raised in connection with the
                                discussion of certain agenda items. As in previous years we would
                                appreciate any information you may receive regarding any items which
                                the Government to which you are accredited is likely to propose for
                                inclusion in the agenda. However, we are anxious to avoid giving any
                                impression that we wish to stimulate the introduction of new

                        <p>This item has been included in the provisional agenda again this year
                            pursuant to the resolution adopted at the last Assembly session. That
                            resolution (a) suggested to the Governments of India, Pakistan and South
                            Africa that they seek a solution of this question by direct
                            negotiations; (b) suggested that the parties designate a Government,
                            agency or person to facilitate contacts between them and assist them in
                            settling the dispute; (c) decided that if the parties failed to reach
                            agreement on the foregoing suggestion within six months, the Secretary
                            General should designate a person for the purposes specified; and (d)
                            requested the Secretary General to report to the forthcoming <pb n="13"

                            is expected to report that the parties failed to reach agreement in
                            accordance with (b) above and that he therefore (in July) appointed Mr.
                            Luis de Faro (Brazil) to facilitate contacts between them and assist

                            for a settlement of this dispute lies in direct negotiations between the

                            report failure to make any progress toward a solution.</p>
                        <p>As in previous years the United States will not play a leading role in
                            the consideration of this question. We intend, however, to point out
                            that from the outset we questioned the wisdom of establishing the
                            Commission. The experience of the past three years has demonstrated that
                            this body is not in a position to play a useful role. We therefore see
                            no utility in its continuance. Because we consider that singling out
                            South Africa for criticism and censure neither improves the situation in
                            South Africa nor contributes to the success of United Nations efforts to
                            promote respect for human rights, we would look with favor on a
                            generalized proposal along the lines of a resolution adopted in 1952,
                            which proclaimed general standards of conduct in the field of human
                            rights (with particular emphasis on race relations), or possibly a
                            proposal for some arrangement providing means for the voluntary exchange
                            of experience on racial questions between countries having such
                            problems. We believe that such an approach would be more likely to
                            obtain constructive results than a purely political approach directed
                            exclusively at South Africa.</p>

                        <p>There has been no indication that the position of the Communists has

                            change the representation of China in the General Assembly. As last
                            year, we shall take the position that the Assembly should decide not to

                            (For your information, by taking the foregoing procedural position and
                            avoiding votes on the substance we anticipate that we should be able
                            again this year to achieve our policy objective with maximum free-world

                        <p>Although scientific data available to the United States indicates that
                            properly safeguarded nuclear testing does not constitute a threat to
                            human health, we believe that all possible information should be made
                            available to all nations as a basis for their own evaluation of the
                            problems of radiation. The United States has therefore proposed <pb
                                n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0041"/>that the following new item be

                            to the effects of atomic radiation upon human health and safety”. Our
                            explanatory memorandum (which the Secretary General will circulate to
                            all <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Members) includes the following
                            principal points: (a) we recognize that widespread concern exists
                            regarding the question of atomic radiation and its effects upon human
                            health and safety; (b) we note that competent scientists in the United
                            States and other countries are making intensive studies of this question
                            and that although a large amount of scientific data relating to this
                            question already exists, this information has not been systematically
                            assembled and internationally disseminated; and (c) we believe that the
                            United Nations is the appropriate agency to collect, assemble, and make
                            available this information.</p>
                        <p>We intend to seek <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> endorsement of an
                            appropriate resolution which will (a) establish a small <gloss

                            representatives appointed by a few Governments) which would receive and

                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or the specialized agencies; (b)
                            request the Committee to transmit from time to time as appropriate such
                            data to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Members for their information;
                            and (c) call upon States Members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and the specialized agencies to cooperate in making
                            available to the Committee (1) reports on observed levels of radiation,
                            and (2) the results of studies of radiation effects upon human health
                            and safety already under way or later undertaken by their national
                            scientific bodies or by government authorities.</p>
                        <p>(For your information, we strongly believe that the terms of reference of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Committee should be confined, as

                            We would actively resist any efforts to expand the terms of reference in
                            such a way as to permit the Committee to carry on an independent
                            investigation and evaluation of radiation effects since (a) pressure
                            might be exerted upon us to disclose classified scientific data and we
                            would be accused of non-cooperation if we refused; and (b) this might
                            open the door to politically motivated studies designed to prove the
                            “harmful effects” of test explosions.)</p>

                            will be very much in evidence as the USSR attempts to convince the
                            Members that by its recent “deeds” it is now the leader in the quest for
                            world peace. It will seek to build confidence in Soviet intentions and
                            generate pressures on the West, particularly <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18"
                                facs="0044"/>the United States, to make concessions of its own. The

                            on the Chinese representation issue, Moscow will probably avoid locking
                            horns directly with any of the Western powers, and for the first time
                            since 1946, its courtship of other delegations may extend to the United

                            resulting from Geneva. On the other hand we should point out that this

                            in the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> resolution, the United
                            States would attempt to have such proposals withdrawn or modified. In

                            subject, you should emphasize that the United States feels it would be
                            unwise to take definite steps in the direction of setting up a <gloss

                            cope adequately with the need it is intended to meet. A premature or

                            insufficient funds would be unfortunate and could result in a serious

                        <p>At the Ninth General Assembly a resolution was passed calling upon the

                            requested to report on this matter to the <gloss target="#t_GA1"

                            Articles of Agreement have been prepared and that progress has been made
                            toward the establishment of the Corporation, which is to have not less
                            than $75,000,000 in subscribed capital and not less than thirty
                            participating governments in order to begin operations. It is
                            anticipated that a resolution will be passed by the Tenth <gloss

                            requests the Secretary General to make a special report in the matter.
                            While the United States Government is in favor of assistance to Libya
                            and has, in fact, contributed substantial aid to that country on a
                            bilateral basis, it is felt that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            as such should <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0047"/>not assume

                        <p>The United States sees no policy issues arising this year with regard to
                                <gloss target="#t_UNKRA1">UNKRA</gloss>, and assumes that <gloss

                            still be made good. If the question is raised, it may be stated that the
                            United States has more than fulfilled terms of its own pledge. The
                            United States contribution of approximately $92 million represents about
                            67 per cent of the total contributions (the original United States
                            pledge was at a 65 per cent figure). Unless other contributions are
                            substantial (which is frankly not anticipated), it may be assumed that
                                <gloss target="#t_UNKRA1">UNKRA</gloss>’s present task is to make

                                    Administration intends to encourage the promotion everywhere of
                                    human rights and individual freedoms, but to favor methods of
                                    persuasion, education and example rather than formal
                                    undertakings which commit one part of the world to impose its
                                    particular social and moral standards upon another part of the
                                    world community, which has different standards. That is the
                                    point of view I expressed in 1951 in relation to the Japanese
                                    Peace Treaty. Therefore, while we shall not withhold our counsel
                                    from those who seek to draft a treaty or covenant on Human
                                    Rights, we do not ourselves look upon a treaty as the means
                                    which we would now select as the proper and most effective way
                                    to spread throughout the world the goals of human liberty to
                                    which this nation has been dedicated since its inception. We
                                    therefore do not intend to become a party to any such covenant
                                    or present it as a treaty for consideration by the Senate.”</p>

                            1948, when this draft was begun, demonstrates that effective agreement
                            is impossible.</p>

                        <p>We will vote against the completion of this draft Convention because (a)
                            the nationality problem should be considered as a whole, and better

                            not provide full equality, whereas United States law makes no
                            distinction between the spouses in nationality rights and

                        <p>Under Article 109(3) of the Charter, the proposal to call a Charter
                            review conference is automatically on the agenda of the tenth session.
                            At this session a simple majority, rather than the two-thirds majority
                            required in other years, is sufficient, together with the vote of any
                            seven members of the Security Council, for a decision to hold a
                            conference. While outright opposition to the idea of a review conference
                            is not anticipated except from the Soviet bloc, reservations about a
                            decision at this time to hold a conference do exist, particularly among
                            Commonwealth, West European, Scandinavian, and “neutralist” members. No
                            strong demand for a conference has been voiced by any substantial number
                            of states. The Secretary General has suggested that a decision might be
                            left open for future consideration. This suggestion has had a rather
                            favorable reception. Proposals have also been made to defer any decision
                            until a later session. A few states have expressed support for a
                            decision to hold a conference in the near future, so that the
                            possibility of proposals for a conference in 1956 cannot be precluded. A
                            much larger number of states, however, have indicated a preference for
                            1957 or 1958 or for leaving the date open at this time.</p>

                            <item>The United States desires a decision in principle by the tenth
                                General Assembly to hold a Charter review conference, leaving the
                                date and place open, and establishing a preparatory commission to
                                report to the eleventh session. Because 1956 is an election year,
                                the United States does not want such a conference held before 1957,
                                and since it is impossible to forecast accurately what conditions
                                may then prevail, maximum flexibility with respect to timing is in
                                the United States interest. A conference held under inauspicious
                                international circumstances would almost certainly prove
                                counter-productive, <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0050"/>and the
                                chances for a successful conference would undoubtedly be enhanced if
                                certain areas of general agreement can be developed through
                                consultations before a conference is actually convened.</item>

                        <p>The United States believes a review conference offers possibilities of
                            accomplishment both through procedural agreements not involving the
                            amendment process and through general agreement on a limited number of
                            amendments which world opinion might induce the USSR to ratify. The
                            United States also believes that even if no changes result, review of
                            the Charter would be useful in making clear its flexibility and
                            potentialities, on the one hand, and, on the other, the limits beyond
                            which sovereign states are still unwilling to go in undertaking
                            multilateral commitments. The United States does not envisage that a
                            review conference would undertake to rewrite the Charter or to change
                            the basic character of the Organization.</p>
                        <p>Outside the United States, interest in a Charter review conference does
                            not appear to approach that in this country. There is skepticism
                            regarding the possibilities of accomplishment at a review conference
                            under present circumstances. Not only is Soviet refusal to ratify
                            anticipated in the case of such questions as the veto. Member <pb n="25"
                                xml:id="pg_25" facs="0051"/>states generally are not seen as willing
                            to undertake additional commitments at this time to strengthen the
                            United Nations in the political and security field, and it is recognized
                            that amendments in the economic, social, and colonial fields desired by
                            the anti-colonial and under-developed countries are not likely to secure
                            the requisite ratification of all the permanent members of the Security
                            Council, quite aside from the USSR. Weaknesses in the United Nations are
                            generally attributed not so much to the Charter as to the policies of
                            member states, and a review conference is not thought to offer any
                            remedy for this situation. On the other hand, there is concern that a
                            review conference might increase rather than lessen international
                            tensions, both between the free world and the USSR, and within the free
                            world.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, a general reluctance to oppose the idea of a review
                            conference is observable outside the Soviet bloc, and a formula that
                            assures, so far as possible, that the conference will not be held under
                            adverse circumstances and only after extensive consultations on the
                            substance of Charter review have laid the groundwork for a productive
                            meeting should prove generally acceptable. In this event, it should be
                            feasible to handle the item directly in plenary. This procedure has the
                            advantage of keeping to a minimum any discussion of substance at this
                            stage. We ourselves are not yet prepared to engage in such discussions,
                            and it is likely to confirm rather than relieve apprehensions about the
                            holding of a conference, with respect both to the Soviet re-action and
                            to “colonial” and domestic jurisdiction issues. Substantive discussion,
                            under these circumstances, might well prove prejudicial to a decision in
                            principle by the tenth General Assembly to hold a conference.</p>

                            operative paragraph. UK also indicated they prepared consider modifying

                            it constitutes decision as specified Article 109(3), whereas presumably

                        <p>If we accept language operative paragraph 1, UK says this will constitute
                            their agreement to take decision in principle hold Charter review
                            conference and to follow up <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> action

                        <p>Department will note that operative Paragraph 2 does not include word
                            “preparatory” and that committee would consider question of fixing time
                            and place but not organization and procedure of general conference.
                            Also, committee would report at XIIIth Session rather than XIth.</p>
                        <p>UK also believes our list of 17 for commission “packed with pro-Charter
                            review proponents.” Specifically they suggest different Arab state in
                            substitution for Egypt and dropping Philippines, Greece, Turkey, and
                            Indonesia or Burma from list. Agree that 3 Latin Americans should be on,
                            though not necessarily those we have on list.</p>

                            conference too long. Conference under UK formula not likely be held
                            before 1960 since suggested committee would undertake no preparatory
                            work, and preparations would therefore have to be made after decision in
                            1958 on time conference.</p>
                        <p>Delegation therefore requested seek UK agreement omission “at an
                            appropriate time” operative paragraph one UK redraft; addition end
                            second operative paragraph phrase “and its organization and procedures”;
                            and substitution XIIth for XIIIth in third operative paragraph.
                            Delegation should point out these changes UK redraft necessary our
                            standpoint avoid impression conference postponed indefinite future and
                            same time would meet UK objection decision hold early conference since
                            could not possibly be held before 1958 if committee does not report
                            until XII session.</p>
                        <p>Delegation should also point out notation in preambular paragraph two US
                            draft in keeping language Article 109(3). However we not prepared insist
                            this point. Similarly, would prefer see “from time to time” omitted
                            preambular paragraph three UK redraft since it somewhat out of keeping
                            Charter context resolution, but this point not essential.</p>
                        <p>Re composition committee, delegation should make clear our list still
                            tentative and subject further consideration both here and in

                                <p>UK opposes inclusion of Burma or Indonesia and Turkey or Greece.
                                    They argue that both Asia and Europe are adequately represented
                                    in above slate and that inclusion these countries would lead to
                                    demand for greater representation other areas (specifically
                                    Latin America) and result would be committee unwieldy
                                    proportions. UK points out that viewpoint Burma and Indonesia is
                                    represented by India and there would be no reasonable area basis
                                    for inclusion either. They feel that inclusion Greece or Turkey

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> then took up the
                            question of Charter review which he noted would be debated in plenary
                            session possibly next week. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> recalled that the question of Charter review was
                            automatically on the agenda of this <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            and that, for this Assembly only a decision on the subject required only
                            a majority vote in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> plus the
                            concurrence of 7 members of the Security Council. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> observed further that there was a
                            great deal of interest in this country on the subject of Charter review.
                            He pointed out that the Congressional Subcommittee which studied the
                            question had left the decision up to the Executive Branch. Our position
                            was that while we favored a decision in principle to hold a review
                            conference, we wanted to leave the date and place open and to create a
                            preparatory committee which would recommend to the twelfth <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> the date, place, organization and
                            procedures for the conference. We hoped in the debate, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said to avoid substantive
                            discussion of specific proposals for the amendment of the Charter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> went on to review the
                            attitude of other governments on this question. He said that with the
                            exception of certain Latin American states there was no strong view in
                            favor of an early review conference. The majority of the delegations,
                            however, favored agreement in principle for such a conference. At the
                            same time, many countries were highly skeptical that such a conference
                            could achieve <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0061"/>anything
                            constructive under the circumstances existing in the world today. The
                            view was widely held, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                            observed, that it was not the Charter which was at fault but the
                            political situation in the world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> called attention to the

                            be maintained over the wording of the resolution. The United Kingdom
                            feared that if other countries co-sponsored, it would be more difficult
                            to resist textual changes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> said that while we were in agreement with the UK
                            on the need to resist changes we felt that on such an important question
                            as this we should seek to get other co-sponsors who would not be likely
                            to try to make substantive changes. We were working along these lines
                            now, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said.</p>
                        <p>The second problem which arose in connection with our resolution had to
                            do with the composition of the Preparatory Committee. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> called attention to <gloss
                                target="#t_DelgaDelGA1">Delga</gloss> 78 of October 11, which listed
                            a group of states drawn from the major geographical areas who would be
                            acceptable to the UK as members of the Committee. Agreement on this list
                            would lead to a committee of 15 countries. The Department desired to add
                            two more states, namely either Burma or Indonesia in order to give Asia
                            greater representation and either Turkey or Greece to give the same to
                            South Eastern Europe. The UK, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> pointed out, disagreed with our view, arguing that
                            Asia and South Eastern Europe were adequately represented in the slate
                            of 15 and that the inclusion of Burma or Indonesia and Turkey or Greece
                            would lead to a demand for greater representation especially <pb n="36"
                                xml:id="pg_36" facs="0062"/>from the Latin Americans thus resulting
                            in an unwieldy committee. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> pointed out that we had reached a point of impasse
                            with the British on this question, they insisting that a committee of 15
                            was adequate and we insisting upon a committee of 17. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> suggested that we now needed
                            authority to be a little more flexible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL2">Bell</persName> pointed out that there was
                            no great enthusiasm among any but our own delegation for Charter review.
                            He noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> had
                            successfully worked to the point where the British were willing to
                            accept our views but that we had reached a sticking point on the size of
                            the committee. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL2">Bell</persName> endorsed
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>’s view that we should
                            seek enough flexibility in our negotiations with the British on this
                            point to recede to a committee of 15, if this were absolutely
                            essential.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> commented that
                            he was personally very enthusiastic about the possibilities implicit in
                            the idea of Charter review. He felt that the two or three years which
                            would lapse before a Charter review conference was convened offered us
                            tremendous psychological possibilities to expose the Soviet position and
                            to put them in an embarrassing situation.</p>
                        <p>Congressmen <persName corresp="#p_HB1">Hays</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCE1">Merrow</persName> agreed with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> about the potential value of
                            Charter review discussion. Senator <persName corresp="#p_PJO1"
                                >Pastore</persName> also concurred, pointing out that our position
                            on the admission of new members made it especially important for us to
                            continue agitating for constitutional changes on the membership
                            question. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            agreed with this observation pointing out that in countries like Italy
                            and Spain the communist position could be seriously damaged by exposing
                            their stand on membership.</p>
                        <p>Miss <persName corresp="#p_GBC1">Gough</persName> commented that in
                            reaching a decision on the membership and the size of the preparatory
                            committee it would be necessary to keep the Chinese representation issue
                            in mind. If we should succeed in obtaining agreement to add Burma or
                            Indonesia to the committee in return for dropping Greece or Turkey, the
                            number of countries recognizing Communist China would be relatively
                            greater. Miss <persName corresp="#p_GBC1">Gough</persName> suggested
                            that if we included Burma or Indonesia on the committee we should
                            include a second country which did not recognize Communist China. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJW1">Barco</persName> pointed out that it
                            would be necessary also, in deciding how the committee would be
                            constituted, to keep the balance between those who favored Charter
                            review and those who did not. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> pointed out that while the Burmese were not
                            against Charter review, they were not as enthusiastic as either Greece
                            or Turkey. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            commented that what we needed was authority from the Department to
                            adjust the number of committee members, keeping in mind these two
                            points. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJJ1">Wadsworth</persName>
                            suggested that we might also tell the British that we <pb n="37"
                                xml:id="pg_37" facs="0063"/>would accept their idea of a committee
                            of 15 if they would go along with our desire for additional co-sponsors.
                            It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BL2">Bell</persName> would
                            request the Department for authority to make the necessary
                            adjustments.</p>

                            Following draft resolution tabled today by Canada, Ecuador, Iraq,

                        <p>To analyze objectively the effect which the 10th Session has had on the
                            international position of the United States, particularly upon the
                            factors of prestige and general reputation in the American role of world
                            leadership, both in and out of the United Nations. To draw appropriate
                            conclusions from the analysis and, where feasible, to suggest possible
                            courses of action for the immediate future.</p>

                        <p>This analysis involved initially a study of all pertinent documents such
                            as agenda, telegrams between the delegation and Department, resolutions,
                            voting records, written reports where available, press clippings and
                            public opinion analyses for the entire period, and such foreign public
                            and press reactions as have been reported. Interviews were held with the
                            seven committee executive officers, the four geographic liaison
                            officers, press officers, delegation advisers, correspondents, and
                            selected desk officers in the Department.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi></p>
                        <p>This study grows out of a sense of official concern at the recent
                            widespread criticism of the American position and performance at the
                            10th Assembly. It aims at objective self-scrutiny with a view to
                            possible corrective action. At the same time, such an evaluation must be
                            made in proper perspective. For example, caution must be applied to
                            sweeping claims that in the United Nations the United States either wins
                            monumental diplomatic victories or suffers irreparable diplomatic
                            defeats. It is necessary to discriminate between gains or losses which
                            have significant public and foreign impact, as against local episodes in
                            the Assembly setting that may seem equally important to those who lived
                            through them, but have little lasting or widespread effect. Another
                            order of distinction is between difficulties that grow out of the
                            substance of American foreign policies, i.e., strategic, and those
                            caused by the way we execute such policies, i.e., tactical. A final
                            prefatory caution is against viewing all such problems as suddenly acute
                            or suddenly remediable. Often they have persisted over a period of
                            years. Sometimes they grow out of larger conflicts of interest that will
                            produce tensions at other levels so long as the larger conflicts
                            persist. And in some cases they reflect the American constitutional
                            system, or partisan domestic policies, or the <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41"
                                facs="0067"/>free range of public and press criticism in this
                            country—that is to say, the “disabilities” under which diplomacy must
                            labor in a free democratic society.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes public criticisms tend to cancel each other out or reflect
                            primarily the political bias of the source. On the Chinese
                            Representation issue, for example, the US position is portrayed by some
                            as a victory (e.g. <hi rend="italic">Watertown Times</hi>), and by
                            others as increasingly costly to US prestige (<hi rend="italic"

                                >UN</gloss> often colors estimates of US performance (although it
                            may be the other way around in this case, since Gallup polls in the same

                        <p>The aftermath of the 10th Assembly has produced an unusual degree of <hi
                                rend="italic">generalized criticism</hi> of American performance in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, coupled with concern about the
                            future effect of current trends on this nation’s role in the
                            organization. Two major external factors significantly affected that
                            role at the 10th Assembly: (a) the increased cohesiveness of the
                            Arab-Asian neutralist, anti-colonial coalition as a result of the
                            Bandung Conference, including noticeable trends away from the US
                            position by such peripheral states as Liberia, along with growing
                            defection of stragglers from the Latin American bloc; and (b) the
                            “softer” attitude of the Soviet Union, at least for a part of the
                            Assembly session. Undoubtedly both the Bandung and “Summit” meetings
                            influenced the situation in New York (although both factors can equally
                            be seen as projections of earlier trends and possibilities, rather than
                            brand-new forces). At the same time, they have not been used by friendly
                            critics to excuse defects in the American position, but rather as
                            reasons why American diplomatic failures can less and less be tolerated.
                            This point of view is often linked to the theme that the 10th General
                            Assembly was simply a landmark along a path of general deterioration in
                            the US position in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>A consensus of the generalized criticism encountered both internally and
                            in the public prints would read somewhat as follows: the United States
                            lost ground at the last Assembly, largely through its own doing. It
                            displayed unusually weak and wavering leadership, particularly on
                            important issues, and often abdicated the leading role to the UK, India
                            or the Soviet Union. It misdirected its energies by <pb n="42"
                                xml:id="pg_42" facs="0068"/>expending unbalanced efforts on
                            relatively unimportant points, often succeeding only in irritating its
                            friends. It tended to take rigid stands and seemed to lack adequate
                            flexibility for the necessary diplomatic give-and-take. It beat tactical
                            retreats after such retreats had lost their political value. It does not
                            know how to give in or lose gracefully. It failed to consult or
                            collaborate adequately with its Allies (or, conversely, overwhelmed them
                            with multiple and overly-insistent approaches). It abused its
                            predominant position among, e.g., Latin American states, our usually
                            staunch supporters in that area and in Europe felt keenly the
                            inconsistency and confusion surrounding certain American positions and
                            our failure to give a decisive lead. We firmed up our policies much too
                            late. Our liaison was ineffective and took place at too low levels.
                            Asian representatives still detect a real or imagined sense of American
                            racial superiority. US public relations and propaganda tended to be
                            gauche and counter-productive. Increased numbers of American abstentions
                            suggest to some that bilateral relationships alone give shape to US
                            interests. On the whole, US policy in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> was characterized as generally negative and aimed almost
                            exclusively at warding off policies and programs we do not support.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, some internal views depict the US as having done “not
                            badly” in the face of positions that were unpopular, and having employed

                            conflicts of world political interests. Generally speaking, the Near
                            Eastern States had no new or special fault to find with the US voting
                            record, but the entire relationship remains colored by the Arab
                            conviction that the US is still pro-Zionist, and the belief, sharpened
                            at Bandung, that the US is more pro-colonial than ever.</p>
                        <p>Far Eastern states reportedly have doubts as to the basic course the US
                            is following and the way we meet problems of interest to them at the

                            the membership “deal”, reportedly raised some disturbing questions about
                            the consistency of American anti-communism. On the credit side, to some
                            Far Eastern states, a policy of abstention is apparently a good one for
                            the US to follow, as in the Irian dispute.</p>
                        <p>Latin Americans feel we are taking them too much for granted, either
                            neglecting them or insensitively trying to command their support. The
                            addition of new members is seen as foreboding a further weakening of
                            Latin solidarity with the US, particularly on economic issues.</p>
                        <p>European states were reported as sensing that US relations with them are
                            closer in the NATO setting than in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>. They felt we “overdid it” on most issues, and are

                            />test of Chinese representation the US applies to every issue, whatever
                            its merits. Needless to say, they are increasingly concerned with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s anti-colonial bias.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that these criticisms summarized on the last few pages
                            are usually directed, not toward the substance of American policies, but
                            far more often toward the tactics of formulating and executing those
                            policies. There was, to be sure, considerable private and public comment
                            on substantive policies. But in the main, the correctives that have been
                            suggested bear either on improved tactics (in the broadest sense), or on
                            broad national postures, such as the overall American attitude toward
                            East-West political warfare in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            toward the colonial revolution, and toward the way in which we try to
                            mediate between international and domestic political demands.</p>
                        <p>These general critiques, while helpful in confirming the existence of
                            overall trends and public moods, need to be evaluated in the light of
                            the concrete issues at the 10th Assembly. Before doing this, however, a
                            glance at the voting record is instructive.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">2. Voting Record</hi></p>
                        <p>The voting record at the 10th Assembly does not have impressive
                            significance as a real measure of parliamentary power, since there were
                            a number of unanimous or top-heavy votes on critical items (e.g.,
                            Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, Radiation Effects, <gloss
                                target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, etc.) which do not reflect the
                            sizeable differences that actually existed on these subjects. For
                            example, the vote of 56 to 7 on disarmament can be seen variously as a
                            propaganda victory for the US or a “vote against sin”, but in neither
                            event does it reflect the private feelings of 56 other governments
                            regarding the US position on disarmament. The votes on admission of new
                            members took place after the “deal” was arranged and do not show the
                            conflict that previously existed (although the 50 or 51 votes received
                            by the four satellites did not indicate much moral support for the
                            continuing US distaste that was simultaneously being registered).</p>
                        <p>On East-West issues, the vote to postpone consideration of Communist
                            Chinese representation passed 42–12–6 compared to 43–11–6 in 1954, and
                            44–11–2 in 1953, suggesting a slight slippage. The motion to delete the
                            “decision in principle” to hold a Charter Review Conference failed
                            14–35–9; this may be compared to the vote of 15-28-9 in 1953 to delete
                            mention of Article 109. The difference is insignificant, but the
                            resolution as a whole passed 43–6–9, compared to 54–5–0 in 1953.</p>
                        <p>The US was on the losing side or on the fence on a number of important
                            colonial or related issues. The inscription of the Algerian item was the
                            most significant, representing as it did the overturning <pb n="45"

                            and an indication of the numerical majority the anti-colonial coalition
                            can muster against strenuous opposition: 27–28–5. On Apartheid, with the
                            US abstaining, the vote was 41–6–8. In 1954 it was 41–10–10, and in 1953
                            38–11–11. Renewed declarations in favor of trusteeship for Southwest
                            Africa carried 43–2–9 with the US abstaining, an increase of 3 in favor
                            and a loss of one among those opposed compared with 1954 (40–3–11). A
                            sharp example of anti-colonial parliamentary strength was the vote of 34

                        <p>According to <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>, some Far Eastern states
                            are concerned at our acquiescence on the four satellites and, by
                            implication, on the dropping of Japan. (Japan is reported as now in

                            postponement of a new bid until it is “independent of all blocs”.) Near
                            Eastern spokesmen feel no one appreciated the “subtlety” of the US

                            encountered on US tactics.</p>
                        <p>e) <hi rend="italic">Algeria</hi>. Most newspapers (according to <hi
                                rend="italic">PS Studies #113</hi><note n="12" target="d22fn12"

                                the Bureau of Public Affairs.</note>) felt the final vote to
                            inscribe was a violation of the Charter. On the other hand, the <hi
                                rend="italic">Des Moines Register</hi> saw US policy as “weak and
                            wobbly … when it should have been clear and fearless”. (This sort of
                            comment is fairly typical of the domestic press on colonial issues where
                            the US appears to it to be “trimming” rather than taking a doctrinaire
                            anti-colonial stand.)</p>
                        <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0076"/>
                        <p>According to some internal estimates, the US did not lose ground with the
                            anti-colonial powers by supporting France, although the French were
                            resentful that our support was not more vigorous. But other officers
                            felt we suffered by contributing to the portrayal of the US as a
                            pro-colonial power. The vote on inscription was also seen as
                            demonstrating the growing authority of small powers in the changing
                            power-patterns of the Assembly. “Most” other delegations reportedly
                            disagreed with our legal stand on the question of competence, and
                            believed that our decision was ad hominem and inconsistent with the
                            stand we have taken on, e.g., South-African items. The sharpest
                            criticism of this nature comes from <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>
                            sources, where our abstention on Irian, which was “understood”, could
                            not be reconciled with our negative vote on Algeria.</p>
                        <p>f) <hi rend="italic">Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy</hi>. On this and the
                            next two items the opinion has been voiced that the US dissipated the
                            initial strength of its positions by a rigid initial insistence on
                            restrictive and unpopular features such as limiting the participants,
                            requiring us ultimately to swallow changes which were of real prestige
                            significance to other countries, and for which we got no credit and
                            considerable blame.</p>
                        <p>Again, estimates vary. It was agreed, in retrospect, that we were
                            unrealistic in thinking we could control the formation of the agency,
                            with hand-picked membership. Not only the Indians and Soviets, but also
                            the Scandinavians, Mexicans, Dutch, New Zealanders, Israelis, etc. were
                            unwilling to accept the Statute on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, or the
                            provision that only recipients of materials would be subject to
                            inspection. The final result was that the US had to accept (a) four
                            additional sponsoring powers (Brazil, Czechoslovakia, India and the
                            USSR), (b) provision for the Secretary General to study the agency’s
                            relationship to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and (c)
                            invitations to all governments to a conference to consider the final
                            text.</p>
                        <p>Some officers felt we were adequately flexible in making timely
                            concessions. According to others, we were overly rigid, grudgingly
                            giving way under pressure from our friends, and as a result, forfeiting
                            the credit and goodwill we deserved for an important lead.</p>
                        <p>g) <hi rend="italic">Effects of Radiation</hi>. This item, also billed in
                            advance as a primary US initiative, was believed by some of those
                            involved to have lost its punch because of US insistence on restricting
                            the membership of the committee. Although our position was defensible on
                            its merits, in retrospect we were seen as honestly mistaken in our
                            concern over the qualifications of participants, since four more were
                            added in a process of “log-rolling” in which the US again had to appear
                            to be blocking a role for others which they felt important to their
                            prestige. While we were able to defeat a Syrian-Indonesian amendment to
                            ban nuclear tests and a Russian amendment to <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51"

                            for instance, were particularly indignant at the narrowness of the
                            participation we had proposed.</p>
                        <p>h) <hi rend="italic">Charter Review</hi>. This was the third instance of
                            the US having to give way under pressure for enlarged participation of a
                            committee, based on prestige considerations in the minds of friendly
                            states. However, despite the lukewarm attitude of the Assembly as a
                            whole to the US interest in a Review Conference, it was believed that by
                            minimizing the US tactical role and eventually accommodating US policy
                            to the prevailing atmosphere, we came out “not badly”.</p>

                        <p>The US, while well-equipped on Technical Assistance and actively
                            supporting the International Finance Corporation, had planned to
                            continue its opposition to <gloss target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>
                            “pending savings from disarmament”, and there has been some internal
                            criticism of the way the US handled this item. It was felt that we were
                            constantly on the defensive, largely because of our “weak”,
                            “vacillating” or “fuzzy” position. In <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss> the US had abstained on setting up an Ad Hoc
                            Committee to study the question, a proposal which is considered by
                            delegation officers to have been innocuous. But the Assembly delegation
                            was given the same position to take, because of Treasury opposition. The
                            delegation was thus felt to be “forced” to make its own decision to
                            support the Ad Hoc Committee. US indecision was apparently obvious to
                            others, and of course the internal effect of having the delegation
                            override its instructions is harmful. There is agreement that the
                            Department should have taken a firmer stand with Treasury at the time
                            the instructions were drafted. As it was, this is considered another
                            instance of US half-heartedness and foot-dragging on a highly popular
                            item.</p>

                                Elections</hi>. According to delegation officers, the US policy of
                            holding back until the last minute before making a commitment to a
                            candidate irritated both the potential candidates, and the US’ final
                            choice. We vacillated between Indonesia and Afghanistan and also between
                            Brazil and Costa Rica, even though Brazil was much the better candidate,
                            and even after we knew that a majority of the Latin American nations
                            favored her candidacy.</p>
                        <p>m) <hi rend="italic">Self-Determination</hi>. The US delegation was able
                            to bring a number of the have-not nations to agree to an amendment to
                            paragraph 3 of Article I of the draft covenant that might have satisfied
                            US overseas business interests. However, the US neither introduced nor
                            voted for it, and even though it embodied changes we had sought, it was
                            adopted over US opposition 33–12–13. In this case, as in other cases
                            where the US eventually votes against humanitarian measures on such
                            subjects as slavery, forced labor, etc., because they are in convention
                            or treaty form, some officers feel important foreign policy
                            considerations are being sacrificed to domestic policy at a net loss to
                            the national interest. (But the Legal Adviser’s Office, for example,
                            considers that our opposition to the self-determination draft language
                            was based on dissatisfaction with the text, and uncertainty whether it
                            would indeed be satisfactory to the business community.)</p>
                        <p>n) <hi rend="italic">Administrative Tribunal</hi>. The debate to amend
                            the Statute to provide for judicial review was conducted on a rational
                            level and the ammunition used on both sides was largely restricted to
                            legal arguments. The US position was reasonable and based on precedent,
                            but there was stiff resistance on all sides largely because of the
                            remaining emotional undercurrents created by the past history of this
                            issue. Majority support was, however, mustered for the US position as a
                            result of strong US political pressure behind the scenes, and the active
                            support and lobbying of the UK. While the results seemed to leave no
                            hard feelings, there was a general feeling among delegation <pb n="53"
                                xml:id="pg_53" facs="0079"/>advisers that success on this item
                            sapped the support for US positions on other administrative issues, such
                            as the level of the budget.</p>
                        <p>o) <hi rend="italic">Other Administrative Items</hi>. While the US
                            position on numerous other items in the Fifth Committee, notably on
                            salary and budget increases, did not command majority support, this
                            appeared to be due less to sharp governmental differences than to the
                            increasingly strong position of the Secretary-General with the majority
                            and his willingness to put it to a test regardless of whether his
                            proposals had the support of the larger contributors, notably the UK and
                            the US. The United States did not appear to enjoy the previous
                            privileged position of a confidant of the <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> and his staff on important issues. While the old
                            relationship did not eliminate public disagreement it did minimize
                            unnecessary public divergencies and friction. While some initiative on
                            US part to re-establish more effective relations can help, one of the
                            basic problems is that, while the Secretary-General appears to want to
                            keep administrative matters under close review and supervision, he is
                            not himself accessible enough to the Fifth Committee because of other
                            demands on his time, and the officers who represent him in Fifth
                            Committee matters often cannot speak authoritatively for him and do not
                            seem to have much latitude for independent action.</p>

                            communicating them to friendly governments in good time. Many
                            difficulties in liaison, such as the multiplicity of US approaches to
                            foreign capitals, waste of diplomatic effort and ammunition, and
                            irritation of other delegations and governments, would be obviated or
                            lessened if the US could come up with timely positions and consult with
                            other nations at the time they are formulating instructions to their own
                            delegations. Unfortunately (though often understandably) it is
                            frequently on the most sensitive issues that the US appears unable to
                            make up its mind in sufficient time to accumulate needful international
                            understanding and support. (The Department apparently realized in
                            advance that restricting the composition of the peaceful uses
                            negotiating group, for instance, would not succeed in New York, and
                            would thus have to be changed on the ground, always a painful
                            process.)</p>

                        <p>This general problem of timing is too well known to require further

                            Several regional sources complained of unnecessary multiplication of
                            approaches to other nations. In several cases we made representations to
                            delegations in New York, embassies in Washington, and to the foreign
                            offices as well, resulting in over-use of pressure, causing resentment
                            and loss of good-will, and implying lack of trust of the particular
                            General Assembly delegation, the foreign embassy in Washington, or the
                            US Embassy in the country concerned.</p>
                        <p>Both <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARA1"
                                >ARA</gloss> felt we had squandered diplomatic efforts in repeated
                            approaches to other nations for support on <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> questions that were of relatively minor importance. This
                            tended to inflate the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> problems out of
                            proportion and used up our limited stock of ammunition, at times on
                            questions where nothing could have been accomplished regardless of the
                            pressure we brought to bear. Sometimes this tactic forced friendly
                            delegations to stiffen their positions on matters on which they had not
                            felt strongly at first.</p>
                        <p>c) <hi rend="italic">Liaison</hi>. There was, as has often been the case
                            before, some dissatisfaction with the arrangements within the US
                            delegation on communicating with other delegations. The regional
                            advisers felt it was a mistake to assign liaison officers on the basis
                            of subject rather than area. On the other hand, staffs of some
                            committees who claim they rarely see the liaison officers, were pleased
                            to have the use of one.</p>
                        <p>Some officers in this Bureau deplore <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>’s
                            inability to select the liaison officers and “having to take whoever is
                            free”. And at least one of the senior regional advisers has complained
                            that he was used, in effect, as an “errand boy”, thus losing the
                            confidence of senior members of his “client” delegations who were quick
                            to note his lack of participation at high levels in the US

                            approbation: (a) Membership, i.e., previous US opposition to “package”

                            Council elections, i.e., US rejection of the so-called Gentlemen’s
                            Agreement; (c) Disarmament, i.e., the feeling on the part of some
                            members that our inspection proposal, while good, is insufficiently
                            pointed to disarmament; (d) Algeria, and colonial issues generally,

                            increasingly chafe under the US position and deplore the overriding

                        <p>But in 5 of the 9 cases in which US policy itself was criticized, the
                            most intense criticism was actually directed toward the <hi

                            policy: Membership, Security Council elections, <gloss
                                target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss>, Self-Determination and
                            Algeria.</p>
                        <p>In the other four cases where US policy was something less than
                            universally popular, adequate tactics seem to have done much to preserve
                            our standing: Disarmament, Charter Review, Administrative Tribunal and
                            Chinese Representation.</p>
                        <p>Conversely, while US policy on two other issues—Peaceful Uses and the
                            Effects of Radiation—were generally applauded, US tactics appear to have
                            caused loss of credit and prestige.</p>
                        <p>The ideal is of course sound policy and effective tactics. If policies
                            are unpopular or difficult to put across, sovereign importance attaches
                            to tactics.</p>
                        <p>From the record of the 10th Assembly one might conclude that efficient,
                            consistent and mature tactics can offset the disadvantages inherent in
                            an unpopular policy. But one can also conclude that no tactical
                            approach, however skillful, can compensate for policies which are
                            unattractive to a significant number of other governments. Probably the
                            truth lies somewhere between the two.</p>

                                <item>A primary psychological factor that is always present is
                                    resentment at the power, wealth and predominant position of this
                                    nation. It affects the attitudes of enemies, neutrals and allies
                                    alike. This is an inescapable consequence of the world power
                                    situation. It is a “built in” characteristic of such
                                    relationships, and little can be done about it other than on the
                                    surface. The sooner we accept this fact of life, the less
                                    handicapped we will be by a sense of chronic uneasiness and
                                    guilt that we are not smaller, or that we are not
                                    “loved”.</item>

                                <item>Another persistent cause of difficulty for the US in the
                                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> stems from the demands of
                                    the cold war, i.e., the necessity for the US to maintain a firm
                                    position vis-à-vis the force of world communism. So long as that
                                    force threatens our values and, at times, our existence, we will
                                    not be able to minimize it to the extent desired by those who
                                    would prefer we not assume a posture of vigorous resistance.
                                    Under these circumstances we cannot have the unqualified support
                                    of neutralist nations. We can, however, decide whether certain

                                    across the board. To do so would, of course, be to abdicate the
                                    bulk of our other responsibilities and commitments, not to
                                    mention our judgment. Thus, we will doubtless have to continue
                                    to maneuver precariously and thanklessly between two conflicting
                                    forces in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. It might be
                                    that we could find a way to reconcile our verbal policies, which
                                    tend to alienate the colonial powers, with our action policies,
                                    which tend to alienate the anti-colonial powers. But there is
                                    not much real latitude for American policy here under present
                                    conditions, and it would be wise to realize that we are not

                                    generally dissatisfied with our performance. Even within the

                                    explore new avenues for US leadership in this field, with
                                    particular reference to the joint statement of December 9, 1955,
                                    by the members of the US Assembly Delegation. It must be
                                    remembered, however, that even if we raise the ante appreciably,
                                    it will not necessarily buy us the affection and respect of the
                                    recipients or their support in the cold war. It might increase
                                    their stability and viability, and we should perhaps be content
                                    with that important objective when and if we can raise our bid.
                                    In this connection it is well to keep in mind that a significant

                                    years seems to have made no real dent in the Communist vote. The
                                    uncomplicated notion of “belly communism” may contain a fallacy,
                                    and the US should devote more thought to the ideological and

                                    affirmations, however good our reasons, we are not going to look
                                    good either to doctrinaire libertarians, or to the non-Western
                                    countries to whom they are of such acute concern.</item>

                                    tamper with its present policy on this subject, but we should
                                    recognize clearly its underlying effect as a chronic irritant

                        <p>4. Thus, there is a hard core of US policies which encounter strong
                            opposition in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on political,
                            strategic, economic and ideological grounds. If the policies designed to
                            advance our grand strategy are based on sound principles, or at least on
                            realistic balancing of domestic and international political imperatives,
                            there is obviously little room for change in them, and certainly they
                            should not be changed for the sake of popularity alone. At the same
                            time, it must be understood that, barring such substantial change, it is
                            fruitless to search for miracles, or rabbits that can be pulled out of a
                            hat to offset the basic impact of these policies on other nations.</p>
                        <p>It may be, however, that in the realm of tactics and the handling of

                                    years (1951, 1955) we have become involved in extraordinary
                                    difficulties in Assembly sessions because of our unwillingness
                                    to countenance the election of an Eastern European state to a
                                    non-permanent Security Council seat. The validity of the US
                                    position rested on principle—the manifest inability of a Soviet
                                    satellite to satisfy the requirements of Article 23, Paragraph
                                    1; and on expediency—the desire to keep a second Soviet vote off
                                    the Council. These arguments were weakened by the fact of
                                    Security Council impotence, the inconsistency with election of
                                    Soviet satellites to other posts, and above all by the
                                    understanding of many other states that this particular seat was
                                    to go to an Eastern European state. Unfortunately, in both cases
                                    the fight turned out to be with our closest allies rather than
                                    primarily with our enemies.</p>
                                <p>The fact that the US has now tacitly approved the election of

                                    usually represent policy rather than procedural decisions, but
                                    if they are considered at least partly procedural it might help
                                    to clarify our problem. Inscription on the agenda usually
                                    relates to the question of domestic jurisdiction, most commonly
                                    in the colonial field. Neither the US nor, for that matter, the
                                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as a whole has ever
                                    decided on legal grounds whether the threshold of Article 2(7)
                                    is crossed at the point of inscription, debate, or
                                    recommendation. The US has modified its earlier insistence on
                                    the freedom of the Assembly to discuss, by voting against
                                    inscription of such issues as Algeria and Cyprus. It is right
                                    and proper that political rather than legal considerations
                                    should guide us in making what are essentially political
                                    decisions of this nature. However, Asian countries, for example,
                                    saw our vote against inscribing the Algerian item as
                                    contradicting the neutrality we proclaimed when we abstained on
                                    inscribing the Irian item. On the other hand, our vote against
                                    inscribing the Cyprus item was generally understood, except by
                                    Greece, as based on genuine concern for the pacification of the
                                    problem.</p>
                                <p>An announced policy of favoring or at least not opposing
                                    inscription of any item that is at least arguably of an
                                    international nature, and then dealing with it on the merits,
                                    might have the advantage of restoring consistency to the moral
                                    position first enunciated by Senator <persName corresp="#p_VAH1"
                                        >Vandenberg</persName>, and might undercut the special

                                    jurisdiction. This would also enable us to maintain our
                                    pragmatic position, which avoids rigid and restrictive
                                    interpretation of Article 2(7), but retains flexibility to

                                        set of expectations about the US which would probably
                                        require us, as suggested earlier, to dispense with the cold
                                        war, satisfy economic and social demands to a far greater
                                        extent, and support the anti-colonial coalition on colonial
                                        issues. Our inability to do these things automatically
                                        detracts from our leadership position in the present

                                        past, by the use of tactics which imply that we view our
                                        relations with other countries as co-equal, respectful,
                                        conciliatory, and friendly, yet vigorous enough, when
                                        appropriate, to give the necessary lead.</p>
                                    <p>So far as the cold war is concerned, while the bulk of the
                                        membership wishes us to subdue our anti-communism, we have
                                        compelling national reasons for emphasizing it on
                                        appropriate occasions. When we do so purposefully it is
                                        because it serves our larger interests, only remembering
                                        that the price we pay is to annoy a significant number of
                                        other governments. But when we do so unnecessarily or
                                        gratuitously it apparently seems petty and childish to our
                                        friends, and exacerbates relations with the neutrals. We

                                    for improvement. Numerous criticisms have been noted regarding
                                    the failure of the US: to prepare its positions on important
                                    issues in time to undertake advance negotiations with friendly
                                    governments with either adequacy or timeliness, to conform our
                                    public statements to the immediate ends we are pursuing, to
                                    conduct liaison with other delegations in ways which are
                                    productive rather than counterproductive, to improve our press
                                    relations, to prepare the delegation on each item in sufficient
                                    time, to limit and aim our diplomatic representations with
                                    accuracy rather than using the shotgun method involving three
                                    centers of negotiation, to distinguish between matters of little
                                    and major importance to us and of little and major importance to
                                    other governments, to execute our policies on the ground with
                                    skill, consistency, and self-confidence, and to learn to give
                                    up, give in, or lose on relatively unimportant matters, with any
                                    degree of grace. At least some of these seem to be within the
                                    range of rational and purposeful control by the Department, and
                                    might well be intensively re-examined in order to improve our

                            and dissatisfaction. If the strategy reflected in those policies is
                            sound, it would be wise for us to forget about winning popularity
                            contests (which is a questionable desire for a great power anyway) and
                            concentrate a great deal harder on procedural and tactical improvements.
                            If it is important to our vital interests to appear tough and unyielding
                            in pursuing our ends, the only sensible course is to stop worrying about
                            the affection of others, and concentrate on maintaining our prestige in
                            the sense of reputation for power, as the British did when the Royal

                        <p>If this is unacceptable, as it undoubtedly is in the light of our
                            national temperament, then we must either give way on some of the basic
                            “core” issues, or extract every ounce of profit we can from the field of
                            tactics. As suggested, there seem to be many opportunities available for
                            offsetting tactics in the areas of elections, diplomatic consultations,
                            press relations, attentiveness to the wishes of others, magnanimity,
                            hospitality, and all the other lubricants and amenities of diplomatic
                            (and human) relationships.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: The Senate Internal
                            Security Subcommittee has been taking testimony for the last two weeks
                            which now indicates very clearly that Chief Delegate <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAA1">Arkady Sobolev</persName> of the USSR delegation
                            to the United Nations and his staff have exceeded the scope of their
                            authority in their drastic efforts to persuade, force and coerce the
                            nine Russian seamen who found sanctuary here in the United States to
                            return to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday’s testimony, for instance, indicated that two members of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Sobolev</persName>’s staff, and
                            obviously under his direction, went into the room of one of the sailors,
                            Viktor Solovyev, in the George Washington Hotel, New York City, and
                            locked the door behind them. This act of violence, illegally practiced,
                            caused terror in the heart of a young man who came here seeking
                            asylum.</p>
                        <p>I would like to quote the following question and answer as he testified
                            here yesterday: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Mr. Morris (Counsel): Is there anything that the committee can
                                    do to make your living more secure at this time?</p>
                                <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0088"/>
                                <p>“Mr. Viktor Solovyev: I think it would be good that the Soviet
                                    officials would be restricted in their activities so that they
                                    would not do whatever they want in this country. They are given
                                    now full freedom to act as they want and they are using this
                                    freedom to full extent now.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Morris: Do you still feel frightened Viktor?</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Solovyev: I still feel a little bit frightened and, of
                                    course, they can still come to me, but now I think with all of
                                    the publicity we have got and all which I told the committee, I
                                    feel more secure.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Last week the subcommittee took testimony which indicated that two Soviet
                            citizens, who appeared to be members of the Soviet delegation, paid an
                            unsolicited visit to Paterson, New Jersey, and called on two other
                            seamen there, purchased three bottles of vodka and seven bottles of
                            beer, and stayed in the humble home of these two seamen until 6:00 a.m.,
                            when the four left without explanation. Little more than twenty-four
                            hours later, three of these four, including the two sailors, were aloft
                            in flight to Soviet Russia.</p>
                        <p>The two Russian seamen at that time had almost two weeks’ pay coming to
                            them at their factory. They each had a small bank account, all of which
                            was abandoned. The landlord of the seamen described in graphic detail
                            the condition of the boys’ room the following morning. He stated that
                            the room was in wild disorder, with rugs rumpled, beds in disarray,
                            records and pictures torn and shattered, and most significant of all,
                            the shirt and undershirt which one of the seamen had been wearing at
                            5:30 p.m. was torn and bloody.</p>
                        <p>Since these hearings have commenced, the subcommittee has been deluged
                            with demands that we do something in order to prevent the repetition of
                            these terrible instances of terror in the United States.</p>
                        <p>We are weighing this evidence with a view toward strengthening the
                            legislation that is now in existence; but, before we arrive at our
                            conclusions in this whole matter, I am writing to you on behalf of the
                            subcommittee to ask you to call formally upon the United Nations to do
                            everything in its power to prevent further wanton abuse of the
                            hospitality of the United States by Chief Delegate <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAA1">Sobolev</persName> and his staff. As the Secretary
                            of State himself pointed out last week, such arrogant misconduct is in
                            direct violation of the terms of the Headquarters Agreement between the
                            United States and the United Nations.</p>

                                >Cabot</persName></hi>: Some weeks ago the Secretary asked me for
                            suggestions of possible ways to strengthen some of our policy positions
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, with particular reference to
                            the next session of the Assembly. I know of your own interest in looking
                            for new initiatives the US can properly undertake, and for our part, we
                            want to do everything we can to strengthen your hand in New York.</p>
                        <p>We have done some preliminary staff work on the problem in this Bureau,

                                        sensitive to international actions which seem to them to
                                        involve values of human worth and dignity; and they find it
                                        hard to reconcile the liberal traditions of the U.S. with
                                        its reluctance to support certain kinds of international

                            <p>These three themes are inter-related. The underdeveloped countries
                                desire economic aid both to raise the level of living of their
                                peoples and to enhance their national prestige. Yet they are
                                exceedingly sensitive about accepting aid under conditions which, in
                                their view, might in some way be thought to compromise their
                                national independence. Above all, they are apprehensive lest
                                economic aid develop into “economic colonialism.” At the same time,
                                they recognize that progress in political independence and prestige,
                                and also in human rights, depend as a practical matter upon economic
                                development, for which they need aid.</p>
                            <p>The situation we face is this. In recent years, whereas we have found
                                it necessary to emphasize the cold war in the United Nations, the
                                underdeveloped countries have found the cold war increasingly
                                remote, and tend to judge the U.S. by its concrete responses to the
                                claims they increasingly assert. Our problem is acutely complicated
                                by the new initiatives of the Soviet Union along this entire
                                front.</p>
                            <p>It thus appears that improvement of U.S. standing in the United

                                development fund within the United Nations has for several years
                                been highly unpopular among the less developed countries and has, to
                                a considerable degree, over-shadowed the large contribution which
                                the U.S. is making and continues to make toward the development of
                                these countries. The underdeveloped countries have thus far
                                refrained from throwing their weight behind a proposal to establish
                                such a fund immediately only because they hope for eventual U.S.
                                support and because they realize that without U.S. support such a
                                fund could not attract enough money to make it significant. Many
                                countries in this group have become impatient with what they
                                consider U.S. delaying tactics and have advocated setting up the
                                fund immediately on the theory that the U.S. would not be able to
                                resist the strong moral pressure to join in rather than incur blame
                                for allowing the plan to fail. Thus far a more reasonable view has
                                prevailed. However, recent indications that the Soviet Union may be
                                preparing, as part of its new tactics, to support such a fund raise
                                a serious problem of policy.</p>
                            <p>The U.S. position in the Second Committee of the General Assembly, in
                                    <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, and in the regional
                                economic commissions would be greatly improved if this country
                                expressed its willingness to channel a portion of its foreign aid
                                through a development fund tied into the United Nations system. Such
                                a fund need not correspond to the structure and purposes of the
                                special fund already proposed and discussed in the United Nations.
                                As was the case with the <gloss target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>, the
                                U.S. could significantly influence the conditions for the new fund
                                if it were willing to make a substantial contribution to it—
                                provided the structure envisaged was sufficiently multilateral to
                                satisfy those less developed countries which, for various reasons,
                                prefer multilateral to bilateral aid. There is a danger that, unless
                                the U.S. takes a step of this kind, such a fund will be established
                                with the support of the Soviet Union. In this event, the United
                                States might then find itself faced with a serious dilemma: whether
                                to continue to refuse support and thus invite invidious comparisons
                                with the USSR, or appear to yield to pressure in following the lead
                                of the USSR.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">2. Technical Assistance</hi></p>
                            <p>Continued U.S. participation in the technical assistance program of
                                the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot be a complete
                                substitute for a multilateral fund as described above. Yet the value
                                of such participation is beyond a doubt. <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> technical assistance has the virtue of being a going
                                    <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0095"/>program. It is proving
                                effective in performance. It is unquestionably making friends for
                                itself among the underdeveloped countries.</p>
                            <p>To the extent that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> technical
                                assistance program involves social as well as economic development,
                                it operates directly in the area of human worth and dignity. This
                                area, quite as much as that of material living levels, is of crucial
                                importance in underdeveloped countries. It is also an area of
                                development in which the West is strong and can make the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> strong. The community development and
                                social welfare programs of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                strike at this problem. U.S. support of this type of work helps very
                                much to lift the shadow of materialism from our reputation in
                                countries like India.</p>
                            <p>A U.S. proposal to increase its contribution provided other countries
                                did the same would unquestionably be welcomed by the less developed
                                countries, especially if this were coupled with a move to increase
                                the proportion of equipment and supplies in the program. From the
                                standpoint of both demonstrated need and administrative feasibility,
                                the proposal is sound, provided other countries can assume their 50
                                per cent share of the increase. If carried out on the U.S. side by
                                diversion of a small portion of our bilateral aid into multilateral
                                channels (a U.S. increase of only some $10–15 million would be
                                involved), the political advantages become extraordinarily
                                persuasive. The U.S. in this connection should be prepared to
                                undertake appropriate diplomatic negotiations with the larger
                                contributors in order to bring the plan to success.</p>

                            <p>The question of self-determination is one of the most complex in the
                                United Nations and has caused us very considerable difficulties, not
                                only in the General Assembly, but also in the Economic and Social
                                Council and the Commission on Human Rights, where unacceptable
                                resolutions on political and economic self-determination have been
                                discussed for several years. The United States is fundamentally
                                sympathetic with the principle of self-determination. We took the
                                initiative in making it a cardinal principle of the Charter, and we
                                want to see it applied wherever feasible to well-defined groups of
                                people just as soon as they are politically capable and economically
                                viable.</p>
                            <p>The United States attitude towards the colonial question as a whole
                                continues to be as stated by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                    >Dulles</persName>: “There is no slightest wavering in our
                                conviction that the orderly transition from colonial to
                                self-governing status should be carried resolutely to a
                                completion.”</p>
                            <p>The United States has, however, run into certain difficulties in its
                                attempts to steer a middle-of-the-road course between the colonial
                                and anti-colonial states and this position has won the United <pb

                                often ascribed to lack of principles or policy. Some of the
                                difficulties arise from the necessity of taking a public position on
                                colonial issues, many of which could be dealt with more effectively
                                through confidential diplomatic channels. Furthermore, because of
                                the fact that the United States administers a trust territory and
                                five non-self-governing territories, it is an administering member
                                along with the colonial powers in the Trusteeship Council and the
                                Committee on Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories. Its
                                status as an administering member and its strategic interest in some
                                of the dependencies place additional pressure on the United States
                                to maintain a common front with the colonial powers, but our basic
                                support for the principle that peoples who are capable and desirous
                                of sustaining independence and self-government are entitled to it is
                                not changed by the necessities of policy.</p>
                            <p>It may be argued that while we may not be able to achieve complete
                                consistency in our policy on all colonial questions, it might be
                                possible to achieve a greater degree of consistency in the matter of
                                inscription of items on the agenda of the General Assembly while
                                leaving ourselves free to judge the substance of each issue on its
                                own merits.</p>
                            <p>The tempo of change in the relationship between non-self-governing
                                territories and the metropolitan powers has accelerated in recent
                                years, and the United Nations has become an increasingly active
                                participant in what has been termed the revolution of the colonial
                                world against the European West. The colonial issue cuts across
                                other political and regional patterns in the United Nations, with
                                the result that it has an increasingly significant influence on the
                                success or failure of the United States in achieving its ultimate
                                objectives in the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>The United States has incurred some criticism by the necessity of
                                balancing the implementation of its policies towards its NATO allies
                                on the one hand and its policies towards the underdeveloped
                                countries on the other. It has been difficult, for example, to
                                explain and justify differences of policy regarding the inscription
                                of such items as Cyprus, North Africa, and Netherlands New Guinea in
                                the last two General Assemblies. If we could make a determined
                                effort, through consultations with other governments well in advance
                                of the next General Assembly, on certain specific issues likely to
                                arise, such as Cyprus, North Africa, and Netherlands New Guinea, it
                                might well result in a greater appreciation of our adherence to the
                                basic principles of self-determination for peoples capable and
                                desirous of sustaining independence or self-government.</p>

                            <p>Human rights questions have great symbolic value for many of the
                                less-developed countries, and their delegations consistently seek a
                                position of leadership in this field. The reluctance of the United
                                States to support certain kinds of human rights proposals, in the
                                face of our avowed championship of human rights, puzzles these
                                countries and arouses their suspicions. Recent developments in the
                                United States (such as the desegregation controversy) feed these
                                suspicions.</p>
                            <p>In some cases, especially where governments tend to be unstable and
                                constitutions change frequently, an international legal commitment
                                is regarded by these governments as the only means to assure
                                continuous recognition of a human rights principle. The
                                Latin-American enthusiasm for conventions frequently reflects fear
                                that substantial gains may be lost over-night if left to individual
                                governments.</p>
                            <p>For the 1956 General Assembly, we may find ourselves in a serious
                                situation unless we can assume a positive position against forced
                                labor and slavery. A draft convention on slavery is to be acted on
                                at a conference in Geneva in August, and one on forced labor will
                                undoubtedly take form in the <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss>
                                Conference in June. It would help greatly if we could participate
                                actively in the final drafting of these conventions and be in a
                                position to sign and ratify them if satisfactory texts are achieved.
                                This would, of course, require a decision by the Secretary to make
                                an exception to our policy of non-adherence to conventions in the
                                area of human rights. In any event, we should avoid restating in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_ILO1"
                                    >ILO</gloss> that we will not sign or ratify conventions on
                                forced labor or slavery irrespective of the final text approved.</p>

                                U.S.-sponsored resolutions for annual reports on human rights and
                                studies of specific aspects of human rights were adopted by the

                            <p><hi rend="italic">1. Cold War Limitations in the U.N.</hi></p>
                            <p>There was little difficulty, prior to the Geneva Summit Conference,
                                in defining “the cold war”. A hostile and aggressive Soviet Union,
                                claiming to be the target of a world-wide conspiracy led by the
                                United States, appeared to threaten the safety of free world nations
                                generally. It bore the onus, in whole or in part, for seriously
                                raising tensions (the Berlin blockade, the hate campaign against
                                Tito, the Korean War). In the United Nations it obstructed the
                                search for peaceful solutions to outstanding problems and made
                                virtually no contributions to the work of progress and development
                                carried on by numerous United Nations bodies and specialized
                                agencies.</p>
                            <p>Thus, while the chief antagonists in this cold war were the United
                                States and the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>, free
                                world sentiment was generally polarized against the Soviets. In the
                                United Nations the chief issues showed a Communist vs.
                                anti-Communist, or Soviet bloc vs. free world, division. United
                                States leadership was vital and generally accepted, and our
                                delegates could in truth speak “on behalf of the free world”.</p>
                            <p>Whatever active and latent features may characterize the cold war
                                today, it has clearly undergone great changes. It now no longer
                                develops along a direct U.S.–<gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1"
                                    >U.S.S.R.</gloss> front; it is no longer as virulent and
                                menacing; it occurs in a different global context. The Soviet Union
                                has at least temporarily abandoned its open aggressive and
                                obstructive tactics; it has adopted a conciliatory demeanor and
                                demonstrated its intentions (whatever their motivation) to
                                contribute <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0100"/>through
                                international organizations and bilaterally to the needs of the
                                outside community.</p>
                            <p>In this situation problems and preoccupations lying primarily in the
                                free world orbit have come to the fore. In the United Nations,
                                Communist vs. free world divisions no longer are dominant. Divisions
                                among free world groupings have increased as former colonial,
                                underdeveloped countries have asserted their strength and
                                independence. A whole series of issues has developed in which our
                                West European allies are opposed by the “uncommitted” (or
                                anti-colonial) nations. We thus have very painful choices to make,
                                while the Soviet Union is pretty much free to court the emergent
                                power (in the United Nations forum) of those uncommitted countries
                                by lending them support.</p>
                            <p>In cold war terms, the United States is here engaged in a contest
                                with the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> for the
                                friendship and political support of countries whose policies are
                                conditioned by their recent independence from colonial rule and by
                                their economic development needs. The new-found Asian-African sense
                                of independence has expressed itself in foreign policies more or
                                less neutralist, producing a regional leader in India whose
                                influence is effectively on the order of a new “great power”.</p>
                            <p>Neutralism signifies more or less unwillingness to take sides in the
                                cold war between the Soviet bloc and the United States-led Western
                                Alliance. The cold war is seen by neutralist countries less as a
                                crucial ideological and moral contest than as a great-power
                                struggle. Helping one side or the other places the new independence
                                in question, arouses fears of embroilment in world war, and is less
                                compelling than the manifold tasks of national social, economic and
                                technical development.</p>
                            <p>In the parliamentary forum of the United Nations General Assembly,
                                the anti-colonial or neutralist “defectors” from the previous free
                                world line-up now have the balance of votes and the inclination to
                                defeat, or make effectively unprofitable, initiatives of a cold war
                                character whether raised by the United States or the Soviet bloc.
                                This situation, together with the Geneva Spirit and other evidences
                                of “relaxation”, helps explain the unprecedented absence in the
                                Tenth Assembly of a Soviet cold war agenda item. Our own position
                                papers reflected the restraint necessarily imposed on cold war
                                initiatives, and also took account of the evident distaste among our
                                closest allies for engaging their prestige in such efforts. The
                                Secretary General, it may be noted, has on several occasions
                                inveighed against the use of the United Nations forum for propaganda
                                purposes.</p>

                                        in particular. The new Soviet emphasis on economic and
                                        cultural cooperation with other countries will

                                    <item>The Soviet bloc has already employed these tactics in the
                                        United Nations, and may now intensify them. In general, they
                                        are manifest in attitudes of reasonableness, a greater
                                        degree of cooperation, and friendly relations with
                                        non-communist delegations. In particular, they are designed
                                        to neutralize, or capture the leadership of, the so-called
                                        uncommitted and underdeveloped countries. The traditional
                                        East-West “cold war” tactics of the communist bloc will

                                    <item>The United States should as a rule abjure cold war tactics
                                        in handling of matters before the Assembly, in the interest
                                        of conserving good will and the prestige of our leadership
                                        needed to build up a record of substantive achievement. At
                                        the same time we must continue to restate the facts about
                                        communism whenever desirable. When Western positions come
                                        under fire, Soviet participation may assume a cold-war
                                        character warranting a reply in kind. But if the complaints
                                        or criticisms are neither originated by the Soviets nor
                                        obviously aggravated by them, our basic posture must reflect
                                        a willingness to discuss the issues on their merits. This
                                        position will leave room in our tactics generally and in
                                        debate for reasserting those established United States
                                        policies and principles which are fundamentally opposed to
                                        the policies and principles espoused by the Soviet Union. It
                                        will not leave room for over-drawn or gratuitous charges. In
                                        support of this tactical line, the United States delegation
                                        in informal-official social contacts should observe normal,
                                        if minimum, diplomatic courtesies toward Soviet bloc

                                        communism may require a cold war emphasis on appropriate
                                        occasions in the Assembly. For example, we might find it
                                        expedient to exploit opportunities to discuss the division

                            <p>The position which the U.S. has taken on the inscription of certain
                                strongly contested items in the agenda of the G.A. has strained our
                                relations with a number of governments and created confusion as to
                                our motives. This paper examines the feasibility of adhering to a
                                legally and politically defensible policy on inscription which could
                                be applied consistently to individual items without prejudice to our
                                position on their merits or substance.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi></p>
                            <p>In the face of strong pressure from our allies and increasing concern
                                over the Assembly’s recent tendency to go beyond Charter limitations
                                on its competence to deal with matters involving domestic
                                jurisdiction, the U.S. departed from its traditional policy on
                                inscription by voting against the inscription of the Algerian
                                question at the Tenth Session on the ground that the action sought
                                was beyond the Assembly’s competence. At the same time we took a
                                varying stand on other items, abstaining in the case of New Guinea
                                    <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0104"/>and opposing inscription
                                in the case of Cyprus, on grounds other than Article 2(7). In other
                                cases where questions were raised by others as to the applicability
                                of Article 2(7) we supported inscription. Regardless of our estimate
                                as to the applicability of Article 2(7) to these cases, the result
                                of our apparent inconsistency was to raise questions as to our
                                motives and to strain relations with a number of governments who
                                felt that our approach was based more on expediency than on what
                                they deem to be sound legal and political considerations.</p>
                            <p>A variable policy on inscription is bound in the long run to place
                                increasing strains on our relations with these and other governments
                                and to damage our prestige in the U.N. Our position would be
                                improved by adherence to our traditional policy that a vote on
                                inscription is without prejudice to the ultimate question of the
                                Assembly’s competence, which can only be determined after the
                                substance of a question has been discussed and the point has been
                                reached where a decision must be taken as to what action, if any,
                                the Assembly should take on the matter. Consistently applied, such a
                                policy would enable us to divorce our stand on inscription from our
                                position on the merits of any item and thus permit us to promote the
                                concept of free discussion in the U.N. which we regard as essential
                                to the Organization’s growth and effectiveness and which a large
                                majority of its members strongly endorses.</p>
                            <p>Having made clear that our stand on inscription is based on
                                overriding legal and political considerations based on our
                                interpretation of applicable Charter provisions, we would then be
                                free to adopt whatever position we deem advisable with regard to any
                                subsequent discussion or action on such items. It would be possible
                                in appropriate cases to oppose action on such items on grounds of
                                Article 2(7) or any other ground without having incurred the onus of
                                appearing to discriminate against particular Members on their
                                request for a hearing in the Assembly. In fact, if we maintain a
                                consistent attitude on inscription and support the concept of free
                                discussion, we should be in a strong position to support our allies
                                on matters of substance in cases where we share their views.</p>
                            <p>Such a policy would be legally defensible and generally understood by
                                most Members. It would ease the conflicting pressure to which we are
                                subjected on questions of inscription and would enhance our prestige
                                in the Assembly. It is recognized that the national interest or
                                other vital political considerations may in some cases require the
                                United States to cast a negative vote or to abstain on inscription.
                                This should be done only as a last resort, however, and on grounds

                            <p>In some cases discussion alone achieves the primary objective of the
                                sponsors of an item by enabling them to meet domestic political
                                pressures to “take the matter to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss>”. Experience indicates that it is sometimes possible
                                to obtain general agreement to take only pro forma action on an item
                                or even no action at all once the matter comes up for debate. It
                                would greatly facilitate the disposition of items in this manner if
                                there were a general understanding that not every matter inscribed
                                in the Assembly’s agenda need result in any formal action or even
                                debate. Aside from the need to find a practicable device to shelve
                                matters on which the majority of the Members would prefer not to
                                take a stand, such an understanding would appear to be necessary in
                                order to enable the Assembly to cope with its agenda, which tends to
                                expand at each session and is usually burdened with several items
                                carried over from previous sessions on which it is generally agreed
                                that no action is feasible as well as a number of items of no
                                general interest to the Members.</p>
                            <p>Neither the Charter nor the rules of procedure require that any
                                particular action be taken on any item. It should therefore be
                                possible to devise a noncontroversial procedure to permit the
                                “pigeon-holing” of such items on the basis of general agreement, and
                                preferably without amending the rules.</p>
                            <p>Another source of friction in the Assembly is our failure to support
                                certain decisions as to the substance of items which are favored by
                                Members in a position to make a reasonable claim for our support.
                                The U.S. has generally voted in accordance with its convictions as
                                to the merits of issues. However, in a few cases we have avoided
                                taking a stand by abstaining in order to avoid offending particular
                                governments or to shield ourselves from adverse domestic political
                                pressure. While the practice of abstention is justified whenever
                                this government determines it to be in its interest, a decision to
                                abstain on the vote on an important matter should be weighed
                                carefully in the light of its consequences for our prestige and
                                influence in the Assembly.</p>

                                functions under various Articles of the Charter, such as those
                                dealing with the admission and expulsion of Members, the elections
                                of the membership of various United Nations bodies, and the
                                consideration of reports and the budget, the competence of the
                                General Assembly extends generally to matters which may be proposed
                                under Articles 10, 11, 13 and 14. With respect to matters falling
                                within the scope of these articles, the provisions of Article 2,
                                paragraph 7 may operate to restrict the Assembly’s competence. A
                                decision as to the effect of Article 2(7) in each instance depends
                                upon the facts of the particular case, as these facts may bring the
                                matter within the scope of Article 2(7).</p>
                            <p>Article 2(7) reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        require the Members to submit such matters to settlement
                                        under the present Charter; but this principle shall not
                                        prejudice the application of enforcement measures under

                            <p>This paragraph constitutes one of the key provisions of the Charter.
                                It employs terms which do not have a precise, rigid meaning and
                                which permit of a certain flexibility in their application.
                                Nevertheless, the paragraph is a part of a legal text, a treaty to
                                which all the Members of the United Nations are parties, and the
                                language must be susceptible of an interpretation which in its
                                general outlines will not vary, and which will be consistently
                                applied in the same manner to the diverse matters which are brought
                                before the General Assembly. This interpretation should be one which
                                takes into account the general sense of the language of the
                                paragraph read in the context of the whole Charter, and in the light
                                of the intentions of the Charter drafters.</p>
                            <p>Article 2(7) prohibits United Nations <hi rend="italic"
                                    >intervention</hi> in matters which are essentially <hi
                                    rend="italic">within the domestic jurisdiction</hi> of any
                                state. Thus, this paragraph has no applicability to activity of the
                                General Assembly which falls short of intervention. And General
                                Assembly action which would constitute intervention is not affected
                                by this paragraph with respect to matters which are not essentially
                                within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.</p>
                            <p>The term “intervention” in international law has a particular
                                accepted meaning, denoting “dictatorial interference by a state in
                                the affairs of another state, affecting the latter’s political
                                independence or territorial integrity.”<note n="10" xml:id="d24fn10"

                                be arguable that this technical meaning of the term should be the
                                one which should be employed in interpreting Article 2(7),<note
                                    n="11" xml:id="d24fn11"><p>For example, Lauterpacht takes the
                                        position that the term “intervention on the part of the
                                        United Nations must be interpreted by reference to the
                                        accepted technical meaning of that term. It [Art. 2(7)]
                                        excludes intervention conceived as dictatorial, mandatory,
                                        interference intended to exercise direct pressure upon the
                                        State concerned.” I Lauterpacht, <hi rend="italic"

                                    <p>On the other hand, Goodrich and Hambro reject this narrow
                                        technical interpretation. Goodrich &amp; Hambro, <hi

                                the adoption of this meaning would not appear to accord with the
                                intention of the Charter drafters. Dictatorial interference by the
                                United Nations could not be effected by United Nations
                                recommendations, and would seem to be limited to action by the
                                Security Council in the exercise of its powers to take enforcement
                                measures under Chapter VII of the Charter. However, under Article
                                2(7) enforcement measures under Chapter VII are specifically
                                excluded from the scope of its provisions. As is clear from the
                                records of the San Francisco Conference, Article 2(7) was intended
                                to apply to the activity of other organs of the United Nations
                                possessing only the power to recommend.</p>
                            <p>In determining what should be regarded as constituting intervention
                                by the Assembly, a proper interpretation consistent with the <pb
                                    n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0108"/>plain meaning of the word
                                would appear to place the procedure of inscribing an item on the
                                Assembly’s agenda, as well as the discussion by the Assembly of that
                                item, outside the scope of “intervention”. To place an item on the
                                agenda is a simple act of procedure which can be done by the
                                Assembly without prejudice to the ultimate decision that it may take
                                with respect to its competence concerning the matter. It is clear
                                from the San Francisco records that it was intended that the power
                                to determine competence was to be exercised by the Assembly itself.
                                In order to reach a decision as to its competence, the item must
                                necessarily be discussed; discussion cannot therefore be regarded as
                                an activity falling within the prohibited area of United Nations
                                “intervention”. It may also be noted that such an interpretation
                                that discussion should not constitute intervention takes into
                                account the view expressed by Senator <persName corresp="#p_VAH1"
                                    >Vandenberg</persName> at San Francisco that the General
                                Assembly should be “the town meeting of the world”.</p>
                            <p>Under the Charter, the Assembly’s recommendations with respect to
                                matters brought before it under Articles 10, 11, 13 and 14 derive
                                whatever force they may have from the degree of unified world
                                opinion which may lie behind them. These recommendations have no
                                legally binding effect, and it would thus attribute a too broad
                                meaning to the term “intervene” to adopt the general conclusion that
                                all recommendations of the General Assembly constitute intervention.
                                A determination as to which recommendations of the General Assembly
                                should be regarded as intervention must depend upon the text of the
                                recommendation as it relates to the matter under consideration. In
                                general, however, it would seem clear that generalized
                                recommendations addressed to all Members of the United Nations
                                urging that heed be paid to particular Charter principles, for
                                example, could not be regarded as intervention. On the other hand,
                                in a case involving an essentially domestic matter, a recommendation
                                addressed to a particular state calling for modification of a
                                particular place of legislation might be regarded as intervention.
                                Or a recommendation that sanctions be instituted against a
                                particular state might also be regarded as intervention with respect
                                to a matter considered to be essentially domestic.</p>
                            <p>As has been noted above, Article 2(7) has no application to a matter
                                which is not “essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any
                                state”. To determine that a matter is or is not essentially domestic
                                must depend upon a consideration of whatever international aspects
                                the matter might have. One criterion which should be employed is the
                                relation which international law, including international
                                agreements, has to the matter under consideration. This criterion is
                                derived from the statement of law made by the Permanent Court of
                                International Justice in its advisory opinion relating to the <pb
                                    n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0109"/>case of the Nationality
                                Decrees in Tunisia and Morocco. In that case the Court found that
                                the matter submitted to it was not one solely within the domestic
                                jurisdiction of a single state because the question involved the
                                interpretation of international engagements which had been
                                undertaken by the parties concerned. Thus, a question which arises
                                out of a failure of a country to live up to treaty obligations, such
                                as a Charter obligation, or which requires an inquiry into treaty
                                relations for its solution cannot be claimed by any one party to the
                                treaty to be one which is essentially within its own domestic
                                jurisdiction. In addition to questions requiring consideration of
                                treaties or general international law, there may occur, as was
                                pointed out during the Hearings on the United Nations Charter before
                                the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations,<note n="12"

                                    [Footnote in the source text.]</note> questions which have their
                                origin within the domestic affairs of a single country, but which
                                may have grown to proportions which have brought about international
                                repercussions and thus have become of the legitimate concern of the
                                United Nations Organization. For example, matters falling under the
                                human rights provisions of the Charter may be of this sort. It is
                                thus not possible to spell out before hand with rigid precision
                                those matters which must fall within the category labeled
                                essentially domestic. The question is an essentially relative one
                                and in each case must depend upon an assessment of the international
                                aspects of the matter.</p>

                            <p>United States practice in the General Assembly with respect to items
                                which involved a consideration of Article 2(7) has for the most part
                                been consistent with the interpretation of Article 2(7) outlined
                                above. With the exception of the Algerian Question at the Tenth
                                General Assembly, the United States has never opposed the
                                inscription or discussion of an item on 2(7) grounds.</p>
                            <p>At the first, second, and third Assembly sessions the United States
                                supported inscription and discussion of the item concerning
                                relations of Members of the United Nations with Spain. At the first
                                session during debate on the item, the United States representative,
                                stressing the importance of the principle of non-intervention laid
                                down in Article 2(7), proposed a resolution inviting the Spanish
                                people to form a new and acceptable government in Spain.
                                Subsequently the United States supported the resolution which was
                                finally adopted by the Assembly containing provisions designed to
                                secure a change of government in Spain.</p>
                            <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0110"/>
                            <p>The United States has consistently supported inscription and
                                discussion of the item on treatment of people of Indian origin in
                                the Union of South Africa, and in no case has its failure to support
                                proposed resolutions or parts of resolutions been on 2(7)
                                grounds.</p>
                            <p>At the third session, the United States supported inscription and
                                discussion of the item on observance of human rights in the USSR,
                                (the Chilean wives item), and also supported the resolution which
                                was adopted, recommending to the Soviet Union Government that it
                                withdraw certain measures.</p>
                            <p>The United States supported the inscription and discussion of, and
                                the resolutions adopted under, the item on the observance of human
                                rights in Bulgaria, Hungary and Rumania. During the debate on
                                inscription of this item, the United States representative took the
                                position that discussion could not normally be construed as
                                intervention within the meaning of Article 2(7) of the Charter.</p>
                            <p>The United States has made no objection on 2(7) grounds to
                                inscription and discussion of the Moroccan and Tunisian Questions
                                nor has it opposed any of the resolutions under these items on 2(7)
                                grounds.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the item concerning race conflict in the Union of
                                South Africa, the United States has consistently voted for
                                inscription and discussion of the item. The United States position
                                on the applicability of Article 2(7) to this question has, however,
                                been slightly beclouded by the statement made by the United States
                                representative in the General Committee at the eighth and subsequent
                                Assembly sessions. In connection with the vote for inscription of
                                the item, the United States representative has noted that “an item
                                of this character invites questions about the competence of the
                                General Assembly under Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter. The
                                United States has observed with increasing concern the tendency of
                                the General Assembly to place on its agenda subjects the
                                international character of which is doubtful.” During consideration
                                of this item at the seventh and eighth sessions, the United States
                                voted against a South African motion of no competence, noting that
                                the motion would preclude even discussion of the item. The United
                                States supported the resolution adopted under this item at the
                                seventh session embodying a generalized approach of calling upon
                                Member States to conform with their Charter obligation respecting
                                human rights. On other resolutions on this question which have been
                                adopted by the Assembly, the United States has abstained, resting
                                its abstention on grounds other than Article 2(7).</p>
                            <p>At the tenth Assembly session the United States voted against
                                inscription of the Algerian Question, citing Article 2(7) in
                                explanation of its position. The United States representative, while
                                recalling “that a vote on the inscription of an item is without
                                prejudice to the <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0111"/>ultimate
                                question of the Assembly’s competence”, explained that because of
                                the action to be sought in the General Assembly under the item, that
                                of encouraging fundamental changes in composition of the French
                                Republic, the item fell under the provisions of Article 2(7) of the
                                Charter. In spite of the rationale which was advanced in support of
                                it, this vote against inscription on 2(7) grounds constituted a
                                departure from the traditional United States position.</p>
                            <p>A study of the practice in the General Assembly reveals a tendency on
                                the part of many Members to express varying interpretations of
                                Article 2(7) from case to case, as the political factors of each
                                case may dictate. As has been shown by the review of United States
                                practice, the United States has been quite consistent in applying
                                one interpretation to almost all of the cases. The legal
                                interpretation of Article 2(7) is one which has the same meaning for
                                all situations, and should not be subject to modification in
                                response to pressures which may on occasion be brought to bear. To
                                apply this provision inconsistently not only undermines our own
                                integrity in the United Nations but also has the effect of arousing
                                the antagonism of these States who may not on occasion have been
                                favored by us with as flexible an interpretation.</p>

                                    should not on 2(7) grounds oppose inscription and discussion of

                                U.N. membership, suggested alternatives would be strongly
                                resisted.</p>
                            <p>Many groups (i.e., Latin America, Western Europe, British
                                Commonwealth and Arab League) have adopted a policy of reaching area
                                agreement on candidates for seats allocated to them. The United
                                States and others have normally supported the candidate selected for
                                election by these areas.</p>
                            <p>The above practices have greatly facilitated U.N. elections and
                                minimized resentments of the various geographic groups which
                                consider the question of their representation on U.N. bodies to be
                                primarily a matter for themselves to decide without outside
                                interference. The chief disadvantage of the practice of supporting
                                candidates selected by an area for seats belonging to it is that it
                                restricts freedom of choice. For this reason it is questionable
                                whether the areas which have not firmly established the practice
                                (i.e., Asia and the Far East) should be encouraged to do so, or
                                whether the United States should become committed to accepting area
                                candidates in all instances.</p>
                            <p>As a result of the admission of many new Members at the Tenth
                                Assembly, there will undoubtedly be pressure for revisions in the
                                present geographic patterns for at least certain organs and also for
                                increases in their size. The Members will desire that the revised

                                Soviet bloc candidates. It is normal U.S. policy not to vote for
                                such candidates. The question whether to abstain or to campaign and
                                vote against a candidate from this bloc has depended upon the
                                circumstances of each case.</p>
                            <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Policy of Abstention</hi>—In some instances (as,
                                for example when the Big 5 have traditionally been elected to U.N.
                                bodies, such as <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>), the
                                United States has normally not raised objections to the election of
                                a Soviet bloc candidate and if a vote has been taken, has abstained.
                                In these cases the United States has not voted in favor on the
                                grounds that the conduct of the members of the Soviet bloc is such
                                that they are not entitled to be represented on U.N. bodies and in
                                the belief that there might be domestic opposition to U.S. support
                                for candidates from that group. At the same time the United States
                                has abstained rather than cast a negative vote because it has
                                concluded that in these particular cases its interests have not been
                                sufficiently at stake to make an issue out of the elections and
                                because even if it did oppose, its position would not carry.</p>
                            <p>The policy of abstention has not kept Soviet bloc candidates from
                                being elected since most countries have continued to support such
                                candidates on the ground that each area in the United Nations should
                                be represented on the various bodies and that the election of a
                                country does not connote approval or disapproval of its government
                                or conduct. Moreover, the U.S. policy on <gloss
                                    target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> candidacies has certain
                                disadvantages. First, it creates problems for the United States in
                                its efforts to obtain the election of candidates of the Republic of
                                China. One of the most effective arguments in seeking support for
                                the latter is that the permanent members of the Security Council
                                have traditionally been reelected to various other U.N. bodies.
                                However, it is difficult for the United States to advance this
                                argument in the case of China when it is unwilling to support Soviet
                                candidacies. Second, this policy fails to take into account the fact
                                that we are better able to deal with some situations if the <gloss
                                    target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> is represented on certain
                                bodies. For instance, if a Soviet national were not a member of the
                                Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions or of
                                the Contributions Committee, it would be more difficult for us to
                                cope with the issues involved in Committee Five of the Assembly.</p>

                                Security Council elections, the United States has vigorously opposed
                                Soviet bloc candidates. It has <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0114"
                                />opposed their election to the Security Council on the ground that
                                they were not qualified for a seat on that organ and that it was
                                definitely in United States interest to obtain the election of a
                                friendly country. It has also taken the position that the 1946
                                “gentleman’s agreement”, which allocated one seat to “Eastern
                                Europe”, was a commitment for the first election only. During last
                                year’s election the United States stressed that no Far Eastern
                                country had ever been elected to a non-permanent seat and that this
                                situation should be rectified by electing a country from that area
                                to the seat originally allocated to Eastern Europe.</p>
                            <p>In the case of these Security Council elections the U.S. position has
                                prevailed except in the election last year, when the United States
                                had to accept a compromise under which the U.S. candidate is to
                                serve for only half a term. However, in an effort to elect its
                                favored candidate, it has been necessary for the United States to
                                engage its prestige through the most intensive campaigns in New
                                York, Washington and foreign capitals. This has been necessary
                                because most other U.N. Members, including the UK and other close
                                allies, have disagreed with the U.S. view that the “gentleman’s
                                agreement” of 1946 was a commitment for the first election only and
                                have also felt that in any event the question was not of such
                                importance that it should be made a major issue.</p>
                            <p>In the election last year Poland was defeated and the need to elect a
                                Far Eastern country to a non-permanent seat was partially met.
                                However, in other respects the election was unfortunate. First,
                                after Poland withdrew, the election became a contest lasting for
                                over thirty ballots between two friendly countries (Yugoslavia and
                                the Philippines), with the United States waging a vigorous campaign
                                for the latter; second, because many of our closest allies,
                                including the UK, opposed the U.S. position; and third, because in
                                the end, the United States was not entirely successful, despite its
                                efforts, since it had to accept the election of Yugoslavia for one
                                year. This experience points up the need to obtain the support of
                                the UK and other Western European countries if the U.S. position on
                                elections requiring a two-thirds vote is to obtain the necessary
                                support.</p>
                            <p>When the question of increasing the number of non-permanent seats of
                                the Council in the light of the admission of many U.N. members is
                                considered, the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> can be

                                the size of the Council unless this demand is met. It is believed
                                that most Members will agree to the allocation of one seat to the
                                satellites and that if the United States opposed such an allocation,
                                they would hold it rather than the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1"

                                candidates), the United States has usually supported the candidate
                                most likely to support the United States on major questions. In view
                                of the particular importance of the Chinese representation issue,
                                wherever feasible it is U.S. policy to support and encourage a
                                candidate which supports its position on that issue. This policy has
                                encountered growing resentment in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>

                            <p>In some instances, the candidate favored by the United States has

                                candidates is limited because, as noted above, on many occasions
                                there is only one candidate for a particular seat and this candidate
                                has the general support of its own area. Moreover, even when it can
                                choose between two or more candidates, the candidate favored by the
                                United States does not always have the requisite support of
                                others.</p>

                                acceptability in the General Assembly, the internal operations and

                                have important effects on their success. The purpose of this study
                                is to ascertain whether improvements can be made in U.S. internal
                                preparations, diplomatic liaison, delegation operations, and public
                                relations, which may reduce unnecessary frictions with other
                                governments, maximize U.S. leadership, and in general utilize our
                                diplomatic instruments most effectively.</p>

                                necessary to defer top-level decisions on important positions until
                                the last moment, experience shows that the result is frequently to
                                create difficulties in accumulating adequate support for those
                                positions in time for their effective execution. At the tenth
                                session the delay in firming up the U.S. position on the admission
                                of new members may have contributed to U.S. difficulties with the
                                question.</p>
                            <p>The enlarged United Nations makes it imperative that early decisions
                                be taken on the maximum number of items. For the coming General

                                on the whole, been reduced to a reasonable length and the format and
                                content include most of the important elements. We should continue
                                to strive for further improvements. Position papers should more
                                clearly delineate issues and give a picture of the anticipated
                                negotiating situation in the General Assembly, i.e., initiatives and
                                attitudes of other states. Such an analysis will help to ensure that
                                the original position adopted by the United States is a reasonable
                                one which, if implemented effectively, has a good chance of

                                initial positions which we know will require substantial
                                modification as a result of anticipated pressures. In order to give
                                the Delegation greater flexibility it would be desirable, wherever
                                possible, to include in the position paper a maximum and minimum

                                    them should be initiated at an early date. First, the geographic
                                    bureaus should be requested at an early date to provide brief
                                    papers which (1) identify the general posture which the new
                                    members can be expected to take within the United Nations and,
                                    if possible, on the more important specific key issues; (2)
                                    indicate any particular factors which should be borne in mind in
                                    conducting negotiations with the new members; and (3) any
                                    concrete suggestions as to the steps the Delegation might take
                                    to establish good relationships with them. For example, <gloss

                                    contact the respective embassies here in <pb n="92"

                                    be followed up with discussions of a more technical and
                                    organizational nature between foreign representatives here and
                                        <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> officers with a view to
                                    providing background material and such assistance as may be

                                    Fourthly, a separate circular should be sent asking our
                                    embassies to make informal contacts with foreign representatives
                                    responsible for United Nations matters. (Mr. Hickerson in a

                                    weeks in advance of the General Assembly, if necessary, to
                                    assist in intensive negotiations. We should at an early date

                                    the various committees as well as an acceptable order within
                                    those committees. We should also be prepared to advance
                                    pre-General Assembly preparations to the point where we are

                                    agenda items expected to arise first in each Committee. Efforts
                                    should be made to arrive at a consensus on organizational
                                    questions, particularly slates, so that the elections will be

                                        emergency meetings of the staff were called at the United
                                        Nations Headquarters. However, there were a number of

                                assisted the Committee Executive Officer and Delegate. The Executive
                                Officer operated essentially as the substantive technician and the
                                liaison officer as the leg man. They provided the continuity in the
                                Committee. It was not considered necessary to assign a Liaison
                                Officer to Committees 5 and 6 since these two committees were able
                                to draw upon the general liaison officer group in the limited
                                instances of need. The liaison officers in the aforementioned
                                committees operated across the board with all delegates and were not
                                limited to any particular region. Committee 1 and the Ad Hoc
                                Political Committee each had assigned to them several liaison
                                officers who operated both on a regional and overall basis within
                                their respective committees. Each of the political committees also
                                had one Foreign Service officer of ambassadorial rank to act as a
                                liaison officer in an across-the-board manner. Nevertheless, there
                                was a tendency to concentrate on representatives of the areas with
                                which they were generally familiar and our liaison with other areas
                                suffered accordingly.</p>
                            <p>On the basis of the experience of the past Assemblies, the following
                                similar arrangement should be made for the Eleventh Session; (1)
                                Individual liaison officers assigned on an across-the-board basis to
                                Committees 2, 3, and 4, with Committees 5 and 6 <pb n="94"

                                officer group in case of need; (2) Liaison officers assigned on a
                                geographic basis in the two political committees, the number
                                depending on the coverage which may be expected of the particular
                                individuals assigned.</p>
                            <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Use of Senior Advisers:</hi> One problem at past
                                Assemblies has been that the experiences and capabilities of senior
                                advisers have not always been utilized to the fullest extent. In
                                order to correct this situation, it is recommended that the
                                following be adopted for the Eleventh Session: (1) one ambassador,
                                preferably with previous G.A. experience, be designated a senior
                                adviser and chief of liaison with overall responsibility for
                                coordinating all liaison work within the seven committees and the
                                plenary body. He would report directly to the Counselor and the
                                United States Representative, and he would be responsible for
                                overall liaison guidance, after consultation with individual
                                executive officers. He would ensure that we were not neglecting any
                                delegations or expending our prestige needlessly. He would also be
                                assigned at least one item in one of the political committees on
                                which he would be United States spokesman. He would be named
                                alternate representative on the United States delegation; (2) that a
                                second high ranking (Class 1) Foreign Service Officer with broad
                                experience be assigned to the First Committee as a senior liaison
                                officer and senior adviser.</p>
                            <p>Such a system would help to utilize their experience more fully. As
                                senior advisers they should be drawn into the delegation’s top-level
                                planning and should meet regularly with the Counselor and the United
                                States Representative. This would offset the disadvantageous use of
                                inexperienced public members of the delegation in important
                                negotiations with experienced professionals from foreign
                                delegations.</p>

                            <p>At one time, <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> pouched on a

                                of it, to interested posts. This practice was discontinued in 1953,
                                and with the cut in the reporting staff at the Mission and the
                                consequent reduction in detailed reporting, its reinstitution does
                                not seem warranted except, possibly, to those posts sufficiently
                                large to have one officer whose <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95"

                                in the day-by-day developments in committee, except where they may
                                be directly concerned. In such cases, no pouched summary can meet
                                the principal complaint by the field in the past, that information
                                sent by air arrives too late to be really useful.</p>
                            <p>It appears, therefore, that more extensive information to the field
                                on General Assembly developments should be on a selective basis.
                                Three suggestions can be made in this connection: <list>

                                        bureaus directed toward the particular interests of the
                                        posts served, and these bureaus might consider instituting
                                        this practice on a more regular basis.</item>

                                        possible to keep an accurate check on what information has
                                        gone by this vehicle to the field, and to supplement as and
                                        where necessary. In the past, the <hi rend="italic">Wireless

                                        and even the full text of resolutions where their importance
                                        warranted it. Presumably, this is still the case, but since
                                        the <hi rend="italic">Wireless File</hi> is no longer
                                        circulated, it is impossible to tell where the gaps, if any,

                                view of the fact that the Wriston program is now in full swing and a

                                field in the next year or two, it is essential that a maximum effort
                                be made to give more officers the opportunity for protracted General
                                Assembly experience. This is particularly true with Executive
                                Officer positions, where certain individuals have had two or more
                                years of valuable experience but can be expected to go to the field
                                sometime after the Eleventh General Assembly. At this coming session
                                we should plan, wherever possible, to bring new officers to the
                                General Assembly as assistants to experienced Executive Officers so
                                that the former can take over at subsequent Assemblies. (This might
                                of course involve increased funds.)</p>

                            had as its purpose to ascertain whether improvements could be made in US

                            public relations which might reduce unnecessary frictions with other

                            diplomatic instruments most effectively.</p>
                        <p>A major recommendation emerging from the study was that a systematic

                                Mission to the United Nations. According to Pedersen, the draft
                                circular telegram set forth the U.S. position on enlargement of the
                                Security Council by two members, the Economic and Social Council by
                                four members, with no increases in either the Trusteeship Council or
                                the International Court of Justice. According to Pedersen, the

                                seat in the Security Council will be reserved for Eastern Europe.
                                This means (a) a seat for the Satellites and possibly Yugoslavia,
                                but not including Turkey, Greece, Austria or Finland, and (b) an

                                development and appearing to support outgoing regimes. If we take
                                rigid position, our influence will be diminished to vanishing point
                                and Russians will have the bargaining position.</item>

                                have been doing and say in effect we presently would support an

                                for Far East. This would let us see how cat was going to jump and

                            on the enlargement of United Nations councils which has been revised to

                            >Supra.</hi></note>). You will note that our embassies would be limited,
                            for the time being, to indicating in response to queries that the United
                            States is prepared to support an increase of two in the number of
                            non-permanent seats in the Security Council (one each to Western Europe
                            and the Far East). The present draft makes no reference to the
                            geographic allocation of the seats as a whole.</p>
                        <p>While we agree that perhaps now is not the time to commit ourselves on an
                            understanding regarding the allocation of a seat to the Soviet bloc, we
                            nevertheless believe it will be necessary, very likely well before the
                            opening of the General Assembly, to discuss in detail the allocations
                            question as a whole. I cannot imagine that any of the regional blocs
                            will limit their discussions in the ensuing weeks to the question of the
                            number of seats. Equally, and possibly more important, to them will be
                            the question of how the seats are to be distributed so as to protect
                            their own interests and at the same time to secure Soviet assent to an
                            increase in the Council. We can expect that an overwhelming majority
                            will insist on one Council seat for the Soviet bloc in the firm belief
                            that this is the minimum price that will have to be paid for Soviet
                            agreement. In fact, I foresee the danger that we might be confronted
                            with the choice of agreeing to such an allocation under Soviet pressure
                            or thwarting the will of the <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0130"
                            />majority. Unless we are prepared to state concretely and in detail our
                            views on both the size of increase and the allocation of seats, which I
                            believe are inseparable, we will not be able to exert maximum influence
                            on others in order to achieve a solution which fully meets our
                            views.</p>
                        <p>I have not discussed this letter with the Secretary since we now appear
                            to be in substantial agreement regarding our proposed circular message.
                            We shall, of course, defer transmittal of the circular until we have
                            your reaction to the revised text.</p>

                            <p>On December 14, 1955, sixteen countries were admitted to the United
                                Nations (Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Ceylon, Finland,
                                Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Jordan, Laos, Libya, Nepal, Portugal,
                                Rumania, and Spain). It is anticipated that the question of
                                amendments to the U.N. Charter to enlarge certain organs in view of
                                this increase in membership will be considered at the Eleventh
                                Session of the General Assembly, scheduled to convene in November of
                                this year. Various proposals are already being discussed among U.N.
                                Members and the Latin American countries are now considering the
                                submission of an agenda item. The United States is prepared to
                                support an appropriate agenda item on this question.</p>
                            <p>Amendments to the Charter come into force when they have been adopted
                                by a vote of two-thirds of the Members of the United Nations,
                                including all the permanent members of the Security Council.</p>
                            <p>The following sections include essential background information on
                                this problem and also a summary of the present U.S. positions. The
                                Embassies are not requested to take any initiative on the basis of
                                this circular. However, if approached by the Foreign Offices
                                regarding U.S. views, the Embassies to which the circular is sent
                                for action are authorized to inform the Foreign Offices along the
                                lines indicated below.</p>
                            <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0131"/>
                            <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Security Council.</hi> Under Article 23 of the
                                Charter, the Security Council consists of five permanent members
                                (Republic of China, France, <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>,
                                U.S. and <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>) and six
                                non-permanent members elected for two year terms. A retiring member
                                is not eligible for immediate reelection. The six non-permanent
                                members at the present time are Australia, Belgium, Cuba, Iran,
                                Peru, and Yugoslavia. (The latter was elected on the understanding
                                that it would withdraw at the end of 1956 and that the Philippines
                                would be elected to serve the unexpired portion of its term.)</p>
                            <p>There are two principal inequities in the present allocation of
                                seats. First, despite the fact that a number of countries from the
                                Far East have been admitted to the United Nations since 1946, this
                                area has never been allocated a non-permanent seat. Second, only one
                                seat is allocated to Western Europe, whereas a substantial number of
                                new members from this area have been admitted to the United
                                Nations.</p>
                            <p>If the question of the enlargement of the Security Council is
                                considered at the Eleventh Session, the present position of the
                                Department is to support an increase of two in the number of
                                non-permanent seats (one Western European and one Far Eastern),
                                bringing the total of such seats to eight.</p>
                            <p>The United States would strongly oppose consideration by the Eleventh
                                Session of an increase in the number of permanent seats on the
                                Security Council. This question has serious implications for the
                                status of the Council and its operations, would be likely to embroil
                                the Assembly in difficult collateral issues, and could delay action
                                on an increase in the number of non-permanent seats.</p>
                            <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Economic and Social Council.</hi> Under Article
                                61 of the Charter the Economic and Social Council consists of
                                eighteen members, elected by the General Assembly for a term of
                                three years. A retiring member is eligible for immediate reelection.
                                The Charter does not designate any countries as permanent members
                                but in fact the five permanent members of the Security Council have
                                always been reelected to <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the five permanent members of the Security Council,
                                the following countries are presently members of <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>: Argentina, Brazil, Canada,
                                Czechoslovakia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Greece,
                                Indonesia, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Yugoslavia.</p>
                            <p>If the question of the enlargement of <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                                    >ECOSOC</gloss> is considered at the Eleventh Session, the
                                present position of the Department is to favor an increase of four
                                in the number of seats, bringing the total to 22.</p>
                            <p>In considering the question of the enlargement of <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, it should be kept in mind
                                that one of its primary functions is the <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106"
                                    facs="0132"/>coordination of the economic and social activities
                                of the U.N. and the Specialized Agencies. This function cannot be
                                undertaken by a body that is too large for effective operation. A
                                body of 22 would be manageable, though it comes close to being
                                unwieldy in size. An even larger body would make more difficult
                                    <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>’s operation and extend
                                the length of the Council’s meetings excessively.</p>
                            <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Trusteeship Council.</hi> Article 86 of the
                                Charter provides that the Trusteeship Council shall consist of: a)
                                those Members which administer trust territories; b) such of those
                                Members which are permanent members of the Security Council as do
                                not administer trust territories; and c) as many other members
                                elected for three-year terms by the General Assembly as may be
                                necessary to ensure that the total number of members of the Council
                                is equally divided between those members of the United Nations which
                                administer trust territories and those which do not. The present
                                members of the Trusteeship Council are Australia, Belgium, France,
                                Italy, New Zealand, <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, and the
                                U.S. which administer trust territories; China and the <gloss
                                    target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>, which are members of the
                                Council because they are permanent members on the Security Council;
                                and Burma, Guatemala, Haiti, India and Syria, which are elected
                                members.</p>
                            <p>The United States believes that Article 86 is a sound provision and
                                should be maintained without change. Under this provision, the last
                                session of the General Assembly elected Burma to the Trusteeship

                                of the Statute of the International Court of Justice provides that
                                the Court “shall be composed of a body of independent judges,
                                elected regardless of their nationality from among persons of high
                                moral character, who possess the qualifications required in their
                                respective countries for appointment to the highest judicial
                                offices, or are jurisconsults of recognized competence in
                                international law.” Article 3 provides that the Court shall consist
                                of fifteen members. Article 9 states that the electors (the General
                                Assembly and the Security Council) “shall bear in mind not only that
                                the persons to be elected should individually possess the
                                qualifications required, but also that in the body as a whole the
                                representation of the main forms of civilization and of the
                                principal legal systems of the world should be assured.”</p>

                                special judicial procedures, an increase in its present size, which
                                is already unusually large for a Court which sits en banc, would
                                tend to hinder the proper functioning of that organ. A Court of

                                sufficient to assure, in accordance with Article 9 of the Statute,
                                the representation in the body as a whole of the main forms of

                            <p>“<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>—If the Court is not enlarged
                                there may be pressure in future elections to reduce the number of
                                seats now held by other areas in order to enable the election of an
                                additional judge from the Arab-Asian group which besides the Chinese
                                member has only two judges. The US is not committed to supporting
                                the existing pattern at future elections. The Department anticipates
                                that some redistribution of the existing pattern would in fact be
                                sought, and there is no assurance that other areas would be able to
                                maintain their present number of judges. It is therefore possible
                                that these areas will urge strongly an increase in the size of the
                                Court. The Embassies should report any indication which will assist
                                the Department to gauge the strength of the sentiment concerning an
                                increase in the Court. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>

                            did not make my position altogether clear, even though it seemed to me
                            at the time that I had been somewhat repetitious about our retaining
                            freedom of action.</p>
                        <p>When I say that we should keep the situation fluid, it means that we
                            should not have our Embassies tell foreign governments in advance, but
                            that we should follow the practice that we have followed ever since I
                            have been here, notably in the case of the Korean Armistice resolution
                            and many others, of turning the whole thing over to me when it reaches
                            this stage to play the hand in the way which is most advantageous to the
                            United States, working, of course, in accordance with policy directives
                            from Washington and in close and constant consultation.</p>
                        <p>I see a very good chance that the hand could be played so as to make the
                            Soviet Union do the dirty work and wouldn’t that be nice?</p>
                        <p>For all these reasons, I not only oppose a rigid understanding about an

                            on August 13. In this conversation Miss <persName corresp="#p_SB1"
                                >Salt</persName> expressed the hope that we would come out rather
                            firmly in favor of an increase of two in the number of non-permanent
                            seats on the Security Council and also take a firm position against
                            enlargement of the Court. The British feel that it is important to hold
                            the line on these matters.</p>
                        <p>We have noted that since the Latin American countries and Spain submitted
                            agenda items there have been few reports of conversations in New York on
                            the enlargement of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organs. We assume
                            that this is because other delegations are not interested in discussing
                            the issues now. In any case, we would appreciate your comments on Miss
                                <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Salt</persName>’s approach to us, since I
                            think we are bound to give her a reply.</p>
                        <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0140"/>
                        <p>We agree with <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName>’s view that
                            we should make no commitments at all at this stage on the allocation of
                            seats. We also would like to see the increase limited to two seats.
                            However, we fear that there will be strong pressure from some members
                            for a larger increase and that this pressure is apt to grow. The
                            question is how we can seek at this time to hold the line to two while
                            still leaving some flexibility in our position.</p>

                            drawing my attention to the memorandum of conversation between Miss
                                <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Salt</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_WDW1">David Wainhouse</persName>. The last time we
                            talked here with the British about enlarging the councils was with [name
                            deleted] on August 1 with the French also present. At that time we
                            agreed that it might well be possible to persuade the Latin Americans
                            not to press their items on enlarging the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss>. We also
                            thought it might in the end be desirable to put off the whole question
                            of Council enlargement until next year. Jim Barco reported this in a
                            letter on August 2 to Niles Bond.<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">Not
                                found.</note> I think we would be wise to wait for [name deleted]
                            return before we make any new efforts to get the Latins not to press
                            their <gloss target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICJ1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> items. [Name deleted] can base his approach on the need
                            for keeping the agenda within manageable limits, and possibly be more
                            effective than the three delegations in such an approach.</p>
                        <p>As far as enlarging the Security Council is concerned, our position
                            continues to be as <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName>
                            described it in his telegram No. 1085 of June 12.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d33fn3">Not printed.</note> So long as the Indians and the

                            themselves there seems little we can do but retain a flexible position.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName>’s view on the
                            allocation of seats in the Security Council, with which we all agree,
                            also has the effect of inhibiting us to some degree from coming out
                            “rather firmly” on the Security Council question at this time. Moreover,
                            we have made our general views rather widely known. Now is a good time
                            not to stir up any hornets’ nests.</p>
                        <p>If the British have any new ideas we would be interested in hearing them.
                            But from here it still looks like the Security Council question will not
                            really be settled until the last minute in the General Assembly and that
                            the wisest course would be to consult [name deleted] again before taking
                            new action on the Court and Commission.</p>
                        <p>With all best wishes.</p>

                        <p>Toward the close of the 10th Session of the General Assembly of the
                            United Nations, sixteen countries were admitted to membership. It was
                            then too late to re-examine the already approved scale of assessments
                            for the calendar year 1956. The Committee on Contributions, therefore,
                            was requested to study and recommend the level of contributions of the
                            new members. The results of its deliberations are contained in the
                            Report of the Committee (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> document
                                <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>/3121). In brief, the Committee, with
                            a dissent from the United States national member, recommended
                            appropriate percentage shares for the new members in accordance with
                            relative capacity to <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0142"/>pay and
                            then revised the already approved scale for 1956 to incorporate the new
                            shares in a new 100% scale. Fifty members (including 10 new members)
                            received reductions. The United States is one of those not changed.</p>

                                        Department believes that the Committee went beyond its
                                        authority, in view of the fact that the 10th General
                                        Assembly set a contributions scale for 1956, 1957, 1958, and
                                        of Rule 161 which provides: “The scale of assessments, when
                                        once fixed by the General Assembly, shall not be subject to
                                        a general revision for at least three years, unless it is
                                        clear that there have been substantial changes in the
                                        relative capacities to pay.”</item>

                                    <item>The Committee’s recommendations in effect constitute a
                                        general revision for which the Committee should have had
                                        political guidance from the General Assembly, guidance which
                                        the United States considers is indispensable in view of a
                                        substantial increase in the number of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                            >UN</gloss> member states.</item>

                            <item>The United States objective in opposing the Committee’s somewhat
                                mechanical recommendation is to obtain adequate consideration of all
                                factors affecting cost sharing by the General Assembly so that it
                                can give appropriate instructions to the Committee. The United
                                States considers that the significant increase in the number of
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> states makes it appropriate
                                and, in our view, necessary that the General Assembly consider all
                                factors including possibly even a reduction in the maximum share of
                                one-third.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Department recognizes that a general revision of the scale of
                                assessments is a significant issue and that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members may not, at the 11th General
                                Assembly, be prepared to consider and accept a general revision.
                                Therefore, the United States tentative position would be that the
                                present scale of contributions should be maintained during the
                                interim until full scale review of assessments in 1958, or earlier
                                as decided by the General Assembly. During this interim, assessments
                                against new members should be established and collected outside of
                                the scale and be placed in the category of miscellaneous income, to
                                be used in reduction of all member assessments. The three members
                                (Canada, New Zealand and Sweden) who <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117"
                                    facs="0143"/>now pay more per capita than the United States and
                                have been promised relief should be allowed a “per capita credit”
                                against their assessment. Such credit could be considered a first
                                charge against miscellaneous income.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The advantage of this interim arrangement is that it would retain status
                            quo the relative position of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> countries’
                            assessments until a general revision is discussed, agreed upon, and put
                            into effect. In contrast, the Committee would grant reductions in the
                            shares of only forty of the old members paying between the minimum (.04
                            through .08) and the maximum. Such changes tend to accentuate and
                            sharpen inequities (even though small), and make later complete revision
                            more difficult. Countries which may be over-assessed would receive
                            benefits not necessarily in proportion to their over-assessment.
                            Countries which are under-assessed receive unwarranted relief and later
                            correction will be doubly difficult to make.</p>
                        <p>If you deem it appropriate, you may emphasize that the Soviet Union has
                            been under-assessed in the United Nations scale and remained so in the
                            current 1956 scale. The recommendations of the Contributions Committee
                            would accentuate this situation.</p>

                                    action foreshadowing a change in the United States share is not
                                    likely this year. Until now, there has been no discussion of
                                    this possibility. The United States has been quiet on this point
                                    for two years since its share was reduced to 33⅓%. Preparation

                                    States percentage. It is reasonable to aim, as a minimum, for a
                                    full discussion of this matter at the 12th Session of the
                                    General Assembly, followed by Contributions Committee
                                    deliberations during 1958, and final Assembly action at the 13th
                                    Session of the General Assembly. Whether this timetable can be
                                    speeded up can be judged only after exchanges of view with
                                    selected governments and a general testing of opinions.</item>

                            elected on the understanding that it would resign from the Council at
                            the end of this year and that the Philippines would be elected to serve
                            for the remainder of the term. The United States accepted this
                            understanding and assumes that it will be honored.</p>

                            an increase of four in the Economic and Social Council, bringing the
                            membership of this body to 22, would seem to us reasonable. <gloss

                        <p>We do not see any need for an increase in the International Court of
                            Justice and have made our position known to others. A Court of fifteen

                            and the principal legal systems of the world, and any increase in its
                            size would tend to hinder its effective functioning. Moreover, the
                            Statute provides that when the Court includes no judge of the
                            nationality of a party to a case brought before the Court, the party may
                            choose a judge, who takes part in the Court’s decision on terms of
                            complete equality with the regular members of the Court. We have not
                            made any definite decision as to a possible increase in the membership
                            of the International Law Commission. We have open mind on the
                            matter.</p>

                            Security Council be raised, we would strongly oppose its consideration
                            at this time. It has serious implications for the status and operations
                            of the Council and could more properly be considered at any general
                            conference to review the Charter. Moreover, consideration of this
                            question would almost certainly raise difficult collateral issues.</p>

                            especially since the agenda for this session is already heavy. We fail

                            concern over possible use of the Antarctic region for nuclear testing.
                            As we have indicated previously, the United States has no present
                            intention or plan to use the Antarctic as a nuclear testing site. We
                            wish to underline, however, that the United States doubts regarding the
                            discussion of Antarctica in the United Nations does not mean that the
                            United States has modified its desire to further international
                            cooperation in the Antarctic, and the Indians and others are aware of
                            past U.S. efforts to this end.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>—We would welcome an Indian decision
                            to withdraw the item or agree to postponement of its inscription at this
                            session. Since the Latin American caucus decided recently to oppose
                            inscription of this item, it is not definite that the Indians intend to
                            press for inscription. While having doubts as to the advisability of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration at this time, the
                            United States has sought to avoid getting out in front on this issue. We
                            wish to avoid bearing the onus of preventing the inscription of the
                            item, and we have sought to leave the UK, Old Commonwealth and Latin
                            America a free hand in organizing opposition to inscription. The United
                            States can be more flexible in its approach to this problem since we
                            have not made any claims to territory nor have we recognized the claims
                            of others. Should this matter eventually be inscribed, our present
                            tentative view is that the objectives of the United States in the
                            Antarctic and our interests there would not be adversely affected by the
                            adoption of a resolution which was limited to a carefully worded <gloss

                        <p>Meanwhile, you may indicate that in keeping with the recommendation of
                            the 10th Assembly, the U.S. is making a careful study of such measures
                            of adequately controlled disarmament as may be feasible in the near
                            future and pending agreement on a more comprehensive system of

                            necessary inspection and control. The disarmament negotiations during
                            the past year, while failing to achieve such concrete progress toward a
                            comprehensive agreement, have been useful in pointing up areas where
                            progress might be made in the foreseeable future.</p>

                            between Indonesia and the Netherlands over West New Guinea. First
                            considered at the Ninth Session where an Indian sponsored resolution
                            (opposed by the Netherlands and favored by Indonesia) failed to secure
                            the necessary two-thirds majority, this question was also inscribed on
                            the agenda of the Tenth Session. At that session the Assembly took note
                            of a Netherlands-Indonesian announcement that negotiations on certain
                            outstanding issues would be resumed and adopted a resolution expressing

                            would be settled peacefully. However, these negotiations failed to
                            achieve a settlement and Netherlands-Indonesian relations have
                            deteriorated steadily.</p>

                        <p>This item appears on the provisional agenda at the request of Greece
                            which at the past two sessions has sought to obtain the Assembly’s
                            endorsement for its view that the people of Cyprus should be granted the
                            right of self-determination. At the Ninth Session there was a consensus
                            that extensive discussion might only exacerbate the situation and the
                            Assembly adopted unanimously a motion stating that for the time being it
                            did not appear appropriate to adopt a resolution on the question of

                            Session the Assembly, again influenced by a general desire not to
                            inflame further our already tense situation in Cyprus and between the
                            Greek and Turkish Governments, rejected the inclusion of this question
                            on its agenda by a vote of 28 (US)–22–10. At that time the U.S. stated
                            that it opposed inscription because the situation called for quiet
                            diplomacy rather than public debate, but reserved its right to support
                            inscription later if that would advance the purposes and principles of
                            the Charter.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the item suggested by the Greeks, the UK has submitted an
                            item of its own on this question entitled: “Support from Greece for

                            walk out of the Assembly at the last session. France returned only after
                            the Assembly adopted without a dissenting vote a motion stating that

                            governments in concrete measures to facilitate a peaceful solution of
                            the various outstanding issues, we believe it is important that the
                            Soviets not be permitted in the guise of an innocuously worded
                            resolution to obscure vital issues and to gain credit for a willingness
                            to negotiate sincerely which is not supported by concrete evidence.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind, we shall of course examine carefully any Soviet
                            proposal along these lines and will wish to cooperate closely with all
                            non-Soviet delegations on procedures for dealing with any such proposal
                            which are best calculated to maintain our common objectives.</p>

                            <p>The present position of the United States concerning the United
                                Nations contributions scale is that (1) the Report of the
                                Contributions Committee should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be
                                adopted, but rather that (2) the detailed discussion of changes in
                                the scale because of new members should be postponed until the 12th
                                General Assembly and that (3) changes in the present scale should be
                                voted only at the 13th General Assembly. It is proposed that the
                                United States ask at the 11th General Assembly that the issue be
                                kept open and flexible, and that we only intimate that possibly we
                                may want a reduction in our percentage. The effect of such
                                postponements, of course, is to throw contributions of new members
                                into “miscellaneous income” which will serve to reduce everyone’s
                                contribution, including that of the United States.</p>
                            <p>This “delaying” position coupled with uncertainty as to our motives
                                and aims is highly unsatisfactory. Even very friendly countries say
                                that we must make our intentions known, that they cannot agree to
                                postpone decision on an issue where they, in effect, may be turning
                                down certain immediate savings for themselves.</p>

                                        members sharing in proportion to their percentage of the

                                prepared to agree to a “satellite” seat on the assumption this is
                                the only way to achieve agreement on an enlargement and that we do
                                not want to be put in the position of blocking it.</item>

                                considerable doubt on the feasibility or desirability of agreeing to
                                a “satellite” or “Warsaw Pact” allocation of an Eastern European
                                seat. They also make the USSR case for such an agreement much
                                weaker. Our experience in the past 10 years with the so-called
                                “London Agreement” also argues against any US commitment to allocate
                                the Eastern European seat to the Soviet candidate in advance.</item>

                            <item>The argument for agreeing to such an allocation is (1) that other
                                non-communist countries will think the communist bloc deserves an
                                extra seat in an enlarged Council and will blame us if the USSR
                                refuses to ratify an enlargement because of US refusal to agree to
                                such an allocation, and (2) that two Soviet-controlled votes in a 13
                                member Security Council would not present us with any real
                                difficulties.</item>

                            <item>On balance I think the disadvantages of agreeing to a “satellite”
                                seat outweigh the disadvantages of not agreeing, although we will
                                undoubtedly receive considerable criticism.</item>

                                <item>The US should not strongly attack the Contributions
                                    Committee’s report but should rather express regret that other

                                    1956. We should argue that the old scale should apply until

                                    and that contributions received in the meantime should be
                                    treated as miscellaneous income. If we succeed on this, we can
                                    save a million dollars.</item>

                                <item>The US should take the position that, because of new factors
                                    in the situation—primarily the increase in membership—the <gloss

                                        target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and should consider the reduction
                                    of the US percentage to 30 per cent. Accordingly, the US would
                                    ask that the Contributions Committee be instructed to prepare
                                    for discussion purposes at the 1957 Assembly a scale based upon
                                    a US contribution of 30 per cent (30 per cent is just about the
                                    figure we would reach by prorating among the older members the
                                    contributions of the new members including Japan).</item>

                                policy and that there is good chance both that USSR can be made to
                                accept Eastern Europeans allocation and that if they do not we will
                                not receive primary onus of preventing enlargement. Flexible US

                        <p>Beginning on October 23rd, mobs of hostile elements gather regularly each
                            day at the USSR Delegation building in New York and conduct anti-Soviet
                            demonstrations. Crowds of malicious hooligans block the entrance of the
                            Mission building to employees, raining abuses on them. Instances
                            occurred where hooligans who were gathered at the building shouted
                            indecent remarks in Russian and English addressed at diplomatic
                            representatives arriving at the Soviet Delegation building for meetings
                            with the chief of the USSR 11th General Assembly delegation.</p>
                        <p>On November 19th a group of people, breaking off from a picket line,
                            hindered (prevented) a diplomat of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            member country from getting into a taxi on leaving the Soviet Mission
                            building.</p>
                        <p>On November 7th, during a diplomatic reception on the occasion of the
                            USSR national holiday, a crowd of malicious hooligans gathered on the
                            adjacent sidewalks and also directly at entrance of the Mission building
                            hindered the entrance of invited guests. Swearing, shrieks and various
                            kinds of threats were also addressed at them. In the Mission building
                            windows were broken on the first and second stories of the working
                            offices and the walls of the building were soiled with paint.</p>
                        <p>The USSR Mission to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, in informing the
                            US Mission to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> of this matter,
                            considers it necessary also to bring the attention of the US Mission to
                            the fact that each such demonstration at the building of the USSR
                            Mission to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, by elements hostile to the
                            Soviet Union, is favorably lighted in the pages of the American press
                            and radio, which often directly incites the conducting of such
                            demonstrations hostile to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0162"/>
                        <p>The conducting of daily hostile demonstrations at the building of the
                            USSR Mission to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> hinders the normal
                            diplomatic work of the Soviet Mission to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. They also create a threat to the safety of Mission
                            employees.</p>
                        <p>The USSR Mission to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> notes that the
                            measures taken by the New York City police authorities are clearly
                            insufficient for the protection of the USSR Mission to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> from hostile demonstrations conducted in
                            the immediate vicinity of the Mission building.</p>
                        <p>The reason for this appears in the first place to be that the American
                            authorities concerned allow the conduct of daily demonstrations directly
                            at the Mission building and its entrance.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the stated (facts), the USSR Mission to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> requests the US Mission to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to take measures, through the competent
                            American authorities, to prevent the occurrence of such hostile
                            demonstrations on the sidewalks in the immediate vicinity of the
                            building and entrance of the USSR Mission to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and thus to enable the USSR Mission to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to fulfill its diplomatic functions, as
                            guaranteed by the Headquarters Agreement between the US Government and

                            <item>Ever since the United Nations Preparatory Commission, the United
                                Nations has accepted the principle that assessments should be based
                                broadly upon capacity to pay. The United States has always objected
                                to a strict application of this principle to its assessment.</item>

                            <item>On the basis of this principle it was first proposed that the
                                United States pay 49.89 per cent of the budget. However, the initial
                                assessment approved by the Assembly in 1946 was 39.89 per cent, and
                                it remained at that level until 1950.</item>

                            <item>In 1952 the Assembly accepted the principle that the contribution
                                of the highest contributor should not exceed 33.33 per cent after
                                January 1, 1954. Since that date the United States assessment
                                percentage has remained at 33.33 per cent.</item>

                            <item>The 1955 General Assembly decided that the scale of assessments
                                (including the United States at 33.33 per cent) should remain fixed
                                for three years, namely, 1956, 1957, and 1958. This scale is
                                indicated in the first column of Annex A.</item>

                            <item>The Contributions Committee of the Assembly—an expert
                                committee—met this spring to fix the contributions of the sixteen
                                new members who were admitted after the scale of assessments was
                                fixed at the last General Assembly. This Committee not only fixed
                                the percentage for the new members but also recommended that the
                                percentage assessment of the new members totalling 6.36 per cent be
                                consolidated into the scale by reducing percentage shares of all
                                “old” members except (a) the United States and (b) about twenty
                                countries which pay an assessment of less than .08 per cent.</item>

                            <item>The Contributions Committee recommended that the new scale which
                                is indicated in the second column of Annex A be made retroactive to
                                1956 and also be applied in 1957 and 1958.</item>

                            <item>The new scale, while affording no relief to the United States,
                                gives to the Soviet Union a percentage reduction of 1.54 per cent
                                which will result in a saving to it of about $750,000.</item>

                            capitals and discussions with delegations in New York indicate that a
                            clear majority of delegations generally support the report of the
                            Contributions Committee. This is not surprising since most countries
                            will receive a reduction in their contributions if the new scale
                            recommended by the Committee is adopted. Further, almost all maintain,
                            on the basis of the capacity-to-pay principle, that the United States is
                            under-assessed.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of other delegations can be expected to harden on this
                            subject when they recognize the magnitude of the cost involved in
                            financing the United Nations Emergency Forces and that these costs will
                            be assessed on the basis of the normal scale of assessments. They
                            undoubtedly will not view kindly a United States effort <pb n="138"
                                xml:id="pg_138" facs="0164"/>to reduce its percentage assessment at
                            a time when large new costs are being incurred.</p>

                        <p>To meet the situation, we propose in the Fifth Committee to take the
                            position that, although we disapprove the report of the Contributions
                            Committee, the United States will, subject to Congressional approval of
                            the necessary appropriation for its contribution, accept the scale
                            recommended by the Committee for the year 1957 provided: <list>

                                <item>That the scale is not made retroactive to 1956. This means
                                    that new members’ contributions toward 1956 expenses will be
                                    treated as miscellaneous income, and this will save us about $1
                                    million. It will, of course, mean that other members will
                                    receive a reduced credit.</item>

                                <item>That it is agreed that the next session of the General
                                    Assembly will review all the principles affecting the scale of
                                    assessments and, in particular, the arbitrary assessment of the
                                    highest contributor. We will state that, at the next session, we
                                    will press for a reduction of our contribution to 30 per
                                    cent.</item>

                            <item>It should be recognized that the payment by the United States of a
                                large percentage of the United Nations budget adds to its influence
                                in the organization. During the past year both the Syrian and Indian
                                Delegations have mentioned to us the possibility of reducing the
                                United States assessment to 25 per cent in the near future, and
                                these two delegations normally are interested in reducing United
                                States influence in the United Nations.</item>

                            <item>The allocation of professional posts in the United Nations
                                Secretariat among nationals of members is based roughly upon the
                                percentage contribution of the member. Thus, if we reduce our
                                percentage contribution, we automatically will reduce, over a period
                                of time, the percentage of the United States nationals in
                                professional posts.</item>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> opened the
                            meeting and gave the floor to Miss <persName corresp="#p_GBC1"
                                >Gough</persName> who announced the schedule for the day. The
                            general debate would be resumed and in the afternoon; the Secretary
                            General might deliver his Middle East report to the General Assembly. If
                            not, the general debate would continue. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJW1"
                                >Barco</persName> pointed to the possible need for us to make a
                            statement when the Secretary General delivers his report. In such a
                            statement it might be desirable to give an expression of our support and
                            adherence to the Secretary General’s report.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> told the
                            Delegation that he had been in Washington yesterday and had brought back
                            the President’s best wishes to the members of the Delegation. The
                            President had been most emphatic about the need for the British and
                            French to get out of Egypt immediately.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> made the presentation
                            on the matter of the United Nations scale of assessments. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName>’s remarks referred to the
                            discussion paper which had been distributed to the meeting as Document
                            US/A/3764 dated November 21, 1956. The principal issue was how the
                            percentage contributions of the sixteen new members should be
                            distributed among the sixty “old” members in the light of the
                            Contributions Committee report recommending reductions for all
                            significant contributors except the U.S. The U.S. position was to have
                            the new members’ contribution treated as miscellaneous income this year,
                            and to obtain a subsequent revision in the scale of assessments which
                            would bring our share down to about 30%.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FJE1">Fobes</persName> suggested that if the
                            Secretary General asks for an advance contribution to the costs of the
                            United Nations Expeditionary <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0168"
                            />Force our problem in putting across the U.S. position on assessment
                            would be much more difficult. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FJE1"
                                >Fobes</persName> had already had some questions—some countries were
                            asking whether our stand on the Committee report would have any bearing
                            on our contributions to U.N. voluntary programs.</p>

                            the Fifth Committee. The best we could expect would be that revision be
                            delayed for another year. There should be a better chance of reducing
                            the U.S. contribution next year.</p>

                            disconcerting loss of bargaining power. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VAH1"
                                >Vandenberg</persName> had finally been able to maintain the
                            position which is still the basis of the U.S. Delegation’s stand today.
                            On the size of the U.S. contribution, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had originally opposed going
                            below the one-third point because there was a certain psychology in our
                            contributing one-third. He now questioned, however, how we could accept
                            the Soviet’s getting a reduction and the U.S. not. He wondered whether
                            we could settle at 31%.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> interpolated that with
                            the election of Japan the total share of new members would be brought to
                            something over 9%. Giving us the benefit of ⅓ of this would result in
                            our assessment coming down to 30%. Senator Knowland<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d44fn4">William F. Knowland (R–Calif.).</note> reported that
                            the sentiment in Congress was that the U.S. share should be closer to
                            25%. He felt there would be great resistance to the U.S. not getting a
                            fair share of the reduction. Senator Knowland felt that we all had a job
                            to educate our colleagues in the United Nations, on the nature of our
                            separation of powers, that the Executive branch could not commit the
                            Legislative to any given figure, and therefore that the United States
                            could not be assessed. Only the Congress could appropriate funds.
                            Perhaps we ought to put in our committee statement a disclaimer that any
                            assessment of the United States out of our treasury was automatic. In
                            this context it was well to <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0169"
                            />remember that we contributed in Korea 90% of the resources and
                            something like 90% of the manpower.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Greenbaum<note n="5" xml:id="d44fn5">Edward S. Greenbaum, lawyer,
                                former army officer, and Special Assistant to the U.S. Attorney
                                General (1938); Alternate Representative at the United Nations,
                                1956.</note> thought it was not wise to quote a specific figure of
                            30%. Why not simply give notice that we were seeking a “reduction”? It
                            would be better not to mention the amount, thereby leaving us maximum
                            flexibility. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            felt that if we said 30% it did not foreclose our going below that
                            figure. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FJE1">Fobes</persName> cited the exact
                            language of the Department’s instructions to the effect that the 30%
                            level would be one of the alternatives and the one for which we would
                            press.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> requested
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JJW1">Jones</persName> to draw up a
                            careful statement for the benefit of the other members of the Committee
                            explaining how the United States constitutional system works,
                            emphasizing that the Congress is the only source of money. It should
                            make clear the difference between our system and the parliamentary
                            system where executive and legislative powers are commingled in the same
                            people. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> urged
                            that Foreign Service Officers whether here or in the field also should
                            undertake to explain how our appropriation system works. We were never
                            committed to any amount until Congress actually appropriated the money.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> felt that it
                            would be a real injustice if the windfall coming from the admission of
                            the 16 new members did not result in a reduction of our contribution. He
                            had never regarded the “capacity-to-pay” formula as sacred at all, even
                            though we were stuck with it. He urged Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JJW1">Jones</persName> to put the opponents of a U.S.
                            reduction on the defensive.</p>
                        <p>Senator Knowland reiterated that the feeling in Congress was strong about
                            assessments of the United States for international organizations. He
                            recalled that last year the State Department had made some
                            recommendations and that the Congress had over-turned them. Even though
                            it was under a Republican Administration, the action of Congress had
                            been thoroughly bipartisan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> thought that it was important in explaining our
                            system, to demonstrate that when Congress reduced or disallowed a U.S.
                            assessment, we had not “welched” on any agreement; it was simply the way
                            our system worked.</p>
                        <p>The meeting adjourned at 9:55.</p>

                                corresp="#p_SAA1">Sobolev</persName> (USSR) came to see me on
                            November 27 at their request. They took up following three items:</p>
                        <p>1. Security Council enlargement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> said USSR was not
                            enthusiastic about enlarging <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. He
                            referred to exclusion Eastern European representatives from Council and
                            to “violation” gentlemen’s agreement on allocation seats in Council.
                            USSR might be prepared go along with increase of two, but could not
                            justify enlargement unless it clear there would be <gloss
                                target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> seat. There would have to be some kind of
                            understanding or agreement that would be on more definite basis than
                            allocation in past. <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Sobolev</persName> said
                            this did not need to be done in Charter but might be accomplished by
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> resolution or report.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that, of course, our attitude was so-called gentlemen’s
                            agreement had only been applicable for one session but that I understood
                            what they were interested in for future.</p>
                        <p>I inquired what they meant include in <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> replied they were
                            thinking of what they called “peoples democracies”, including
                            Yugoslavia. In response to further question, he said they had not
                            thought of Greece, Turkey or Finland. I told him I had no instructions
                            on this question but would seek them immediately.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> also asked whether we
                            had considered possible increase in permanent members. I told him we had
                            not and asked what he had in mind, observing there might be number of
                            claimants. <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> admitted
                            there might be other aspirants but noted that at the present time there
                            was only one big power in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that was not
                            permanent or non permanent member of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>,
                            and that was India. In subsequent statement referring to an increase to
                            “7 or 8” non permanent members, he implied increase of two might include
                            one non permanent member and India as permanent member.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> opened the
                            meeting with an announcement that he had received word last night from
                            the Department that they were making progress and that we should be
                            ready soon to go ahead with new steps on the Hungarian situation,
                            perhaps tomorrow. Miss <persName corresp="#p_GBC1">Gough</persName>
                            announced that there would be only one item for discussion at this
                            Delegation meeting, since a number of delegates were busy with
                            negotiations which required shortening the meeting.</p>
                        <p>On the one item—the Scale of Assessments—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1"
                                >Bender</persName> led off the discussion. The issue was that of how
                            the percentage contributions of the new member states to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> budget would be distributed among the old
                            members. Although opposed to the inequity of the Contributions Committee
                            report, the U.S. Delegation had accepted the proposed new scale for 1957
                            as recommended in the report. In addition to opposing retroactive
                            application of the scale to 1956, we had objected to the adoption of the
                            same scale for 1958. We favored, rather, a full debate on the scale of
                            assessments at the next session of the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>With regard to our resolution presented in the Fifth Committee, the
                            reaction was even less sympathetic than we had expected, despite our own
                            feeling that we had made a real compromise in dropping our opposition to
                            the ‘57 scale. The only delegations to speak in favor of our resolution
                            were those of the United Kingdom, Canada, Burma, and Iraq. Argentina had
                            spoken against our resolution and the Chinese had not supported us,
                            wanting instead a reduction of their own contributions. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> thought it was clear that we
                            could not win our fight against retroactive assessments for 1956 and
                            suggested that we drop it. Committee 5 still wanted to vote the same
                            scale for 1958 but we had a chance to defeat that. <pb n="146"
                                xml:id="pg_146" facs="0172"/>Our instructions from the Department
                            were to accept the scale for 1957 but to make a fight on the 1958 scale
                            and to press for a full debate in the next session.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> asked whether he
                            was correct in believing that the Headquarters Agreement had not
                            committed us to any particular percentage contribution. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> cited the Charter provision in
                            Article 17 that the General Assembly “shall” apportion the expenses of
                            the organization among the members. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> pointed out that the General
                            Assembly only recommends; its recommendations were not legally binding
                            action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> then called
                            attention to Article 19 of the Charter which provides for withholding
                            the vote of a member nation if its arrears equals the amount of its
                            contributions for the preceding two full years. In this context, it was
                            notable that the Soviet Union had said it would not be bound by any
                            assessment for the expenses of the United Nations Emergency Force.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> recorded his
                            feeling that the Committee’s refusal to vote a share in the reduction to
                            the United States was “outrageously unfair.” Senator Knowland wanted it
                            understood that he as a Senator was not bound by any such concept as
                            that prevailing in the Committee. He said that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JJW1">Jones</persName> yesterday had made it clear that
                            the United States could not be assessed without the consent of Congress.
                            Senator Knowland did not want any misunderstanding later; it must be
                            made clear that the General Assembly could not bind Congress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> pointed out that if the
                            General Assembly approves the Committee recommendations over our
                            objection, it then becomes at least a question of complying with the
                            General Assembly recommendation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> thought the question was rather how much
                            unfairness we could tolerate. The other delegations appeared not to know
                            what they were doing—other things would be affected by refusing the
                            United States a share in the reduction. In terms of dollars our fair
                            share of the reduction would be small. After all we could financially
                            afford to pay 100% of the budget but this in Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s view, was a matter of
                            principle. Mr. Hoffman asked whether our failure to pay all that the
                            General Assembly had “assessed” us for two years would mean that then we
                            had to get out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> reminded the delegation
                            that today we would vote against any commitment on the 1958 assessments.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said that if we
                            were defeated in Committee, we would take it to the Plenary session. We
                            must educate the other delegations; even with regard to the retroactive
                            scale for 1956. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s own
                            feeling would have been not to go along. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1"
                                >Bender</persName> thought in accepting the 1956 scale we had a
                            better chance of blocking the scale <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147"
                                facs="0173"/>as recommended for 1958. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> considered the scale
                            “inequitable” and favored arguing it out. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_WJJ1">Wadsworth</persName> thought it was also unfair
                            that some fifty other member nations had their contributions reduced
                            while we had not. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> doubted that the Committee could have handled the
                            matter in a way more offensive to the United States.</p>
                        <p>In answer to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>’s
                            question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> estimated
                            that our fair share of the reduction would be about $1,000,000.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JJW1">Jones</persName> was in favor of
                            “standing by our guns”. We should give them the facts of life; we ought
                            to let them know now how we stand.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_LMPMOB1">Lord</persName> asked whether we were
                            authorized to tell the Technical Assistance, <gloss target="#t_UNICEF1"
                                >UNICEF</gloss> and other groups what we thought the psychological
                            effect would be on our contributions to other voluntary program budgets.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said that in
                            doing so, we must give the idea that we are generous, but not to be
                            imposed upon, not to be discriminated against. Mr. Sears expressed the
                            feeling that it was undignified for us even to talk about it. He was
                            ready to urge that Senator Knowland tell the General Assembly that the
                            United States Congress simply would not vote for any such unfair
                            assessment. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            thought such a step as Mr. Sears proposed would require some thinking
                            about; it might defeat our purpose. Senator Knowland stressed that we
                            must make the record clear. The Senator promised that he would “raise
                            hell in Congress” and that was the most conservative statement he could
                            make.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> surmised that the
                            figure of 33.1% as the United States share, formerly regarded as a
                            ceiling, was now considered by others to be a floor. The other
                            delegations appeared to be giving no thought to anything but looking out
                            for their own treasuries. Senator Knowland warned that passing the
                            proposed scale would set a precedent and the other delegations ought to
                            know that Congress can get arbitrary too. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJE1">Fobes</persName> expressed the opinion that we had
                            been able to make ourselves clear about the 1956 and 1957 scales. It
                            would be better to concentrate on gaining votes with regard to the 1958
                            scale. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> thought
                            that we need not insist on voting against but we must make our position
                            clear that we cannot defend such a thing before any representative group
                            of Americans. It was folly for the Committee to be bureaucratic when
                            this matter of principle was involved.</p>
                        <p>Before closing the meeting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> congratulated Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BE1"
                                >Bunker</persName> on his appointment as Ambassador to India, which
                            had been announced by the White House yesterday. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> said that he was looking forward
                            to a most interesting assignment in India. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_WJJ1">Wadsworth</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> whether he could <pb n="148"
                                xml:id="pg_148" facs="0174"/>take back to New Delhi with him the
                            controversial head of the Indian Delegation. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> assured Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> that he would get immediate
                            confirmation by the Senate if he would do so.</p>

                            compliments to the US Mission to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            has the honor to register a protest based on the assault by anti-Soviet
                            hooligan elements on women employees of the Delegation, which took place
                            on December 11th, at 7:30 in the evening, at the corner of Park Avenue
                            and 69th Street. The circumstances of the assault were such that it
                            evidently had been planned in advance, since, at the approach of the
                            group of Soviet employees, one of the attackers stepped out of an
                            automobile standing on the corner and at the same moment another one
                            popped out from the corner of 69th Street.</p>
                        <p>The attackers attempted to do bodily injury to a Delegation employee who
                            was accompanying the women, A. Nikolaev, and tore his outer clothing. In
                            regard to the three women Delegation employees, the hooligans used
                            abusive censurable expressions. The hooligans were not arrested by the
                            police guarding the Delegation building.</p>
                        <p>In calling the attention of the US Mission to <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        <p>Two State Department officers, Mr. Goott (G) and Mr. Blake (<gloss
                                target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss>) came to New York yesterday for a
                            pre-arranged interview with representatives of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ILA1">ILA</gloss> and of the New York City administration
                            for the purpose of discussing the effect which the recently announced
                                <gloss target="#t_ILA1">ILA</gloss> boycott of Communist goods will
                            have on official shipments to Soviet and satellite missions in the US.
                            They made it clear to Captain Bradley and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GSE1">Gleason</persName> that the State Department takes
                            no official stand regarding the boycott insofar as it affects commercial
                            cargoes. The only interest of the State Department is to attempt to
                            ensure that official shipments consigned to the Soviet and satellite
                            missions here will not be interfered with. The reason for our concern is
                            the thinly veiled threat which Soviet representatives in Moscow and also
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> have made to the effect that
                            they will retaliate against our missions in Eastern Europe if their
                            shipments are interfered with here.</p>
                        <p>Captain Bradley said he now understood the problem. He had been working
                            under the impression that the State Department was going to attempt to
                            persuade the longshoremen to lift the boycott completely. He said,
                            however, that this was a matter which would have to be taken up with the
                            whole <gloss target="#t_ILA1">ILA</gloss> membership and promised that
                            he would do so at the first opportunity. This opportunity will come at a
                            meeting on Monday (12/17). He therefore asked if the Department could
                            send him a letter<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">Not found.</note>
                            explaining the situation. Mr. Goott and Mr. Blake promised to do so
                            through the medium of Commissioner Felix.</p>
                        <p>Because an article written by Victor Riesel in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Daily Mirror</hi> charged that the State Department was seeking to
                            pressure the longshoremen into lifting the boycott completely,
                            Commissioner <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0181"/>Felix declared
                            that he had received inquiries from a number of papers and he felt it
                            would be necessary to make a statement on the subject. Accordingly, he
                            and Mr. Goott agreed on a line explaining that the Department’s interest
                            was confined to official traffic. This was the origin of stories which
                            appeared in some papers today on the subject.</p>

                                <p>Intention in 4-power meeting would be to make further attempt to
                                    have <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> (USSR)
                                    produce his own formula and to give him this only if, as we
                                    expect, he does not do so. In return for our agreement on <gloss
                                        target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> allocation, three delegations
                                    intend to seek USSR commit itself to enlargement by two and no
                                    more. <persName>Humphrey</persName> has already made clear to
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> that U.S.
                                    would not be prepared to reach agreement with USSR on <gloss

                                    therefore have to await such clarification. We informed UK and

                            demonstrations by what Gromyko called “anti-Soviet elements” and
                            requesting that measures be taken by American authorities prevent
                            repetition of what he termed “interference with normal functioning
                            Soviet mission to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.”</p>
                        <p>Gromyko mentioned that on November 7 windows had been broken in mission
                            and building smeared with paint, that also these “elements” had on some
                            occasions sought forcibly prevent entrance by visitors to Soviet
                            Mission, including representatives other countries. These demonstrations
                            and hostile actions against Soviet Mission New York had every time been
                            heavily played up in sensational form by U.S. press. Despite these two
                            notes U.S. authorities had not taken appropriate measures and these
                            actions which not only interfered with normal work of mission but also
                            threatened security its personnel continued and, according Gromyko,
                            occurred almost daily. If actions were not taken remedy this situation
                            Ministry Foreign Affairs would find it necessary publish facts in this
                            matter, the Soviet notes of protest and, as he put it, failure U.S.
                            authorities take any action. Gromyko said therefore he was asking me
                            request my Government take immediate necessary measures permit normal
                            functioning Soviet Mission in New York, adding Ministry did not wish
                            give publicity this matter here since, he said, it would arouse
                            “legitimate indignation” Soviet public opinion and affect “attitude” of
                            population of capital to Embassy here. I made Gromyko repeat last
                            statement and inquired if that meant demonstrations would be organized
                            against Embassy, pointing out that such demonstrations, including
                            violation diplomatic immunity, had occurred British, French and Israeli
                            Missions here. Gromyko would not go beyond his statement about
                            indignation and attitude Moscow population to Embassy. He emphasized,
                            however, Ministry wished if possible avoid necessity publication [<hi
                                rend="italic">publicity</hi>].</p>
                        <p>I told Gromyko I would of course bring his démarche to attention my
                            Government, but I was sure he realized that right of <pb n="158"
                                xml:id="pg_158" facs="0184"/>peaceful demonstration or assembly was
                            protected by law in U.S., but that any acts violence or physical
                            interference with normal work Mission, security its personnel was quite
                            another matter and I was sure necessary precautions had been taken by
                            New York authorities. I asked him if there had been any repetition of
                            window-breaking or other acts similar nature against Mission since those
                            November 7, to which he replied in the negative but said that
                            interference with visitors still continued, and he felt there were many
                            ways interfering with normal work Mission apart from acts of what he
                            termed “hooliganism”.</p>
                        <p>From what Gromyko said to me apparently Soviets do not intend give any
                            publicity this matter pending receipt of reply to this démarche. Threat
                            of demonstrations against Embassy here in event unsatisfactory reply is
                            unmistakable, but I would strongly recommend that this possibility
                            should not be allowed to affect our reply which should be solely on
                            merits. If such demonstrations occur I can assure Department Embassy
                            will be able take it in stride, although in view emphasis placed by
                            Gromyko on this point in regard Mission New York they might conceivably

                        <p>I believe in circumstances it would be advisable give prompt reply
                            Gromyko indicating measures that have been taken, which I assume to be
                            case, by New York authorities to permit normal functioning Soviet
                            Mission, and such assurances for future as may be appropriate in
                            circumstances. Gromyko went some length emphasize Ministry’s reluctance
                            to publicize, and I believe chief point of démarche was to remedy
                            situation New York. However, in view Soviet resolution <gloss

                            completely accurate rendering in Russian. I then emphasized directly to
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZAV1">Zakharov</persName> assurances received
                            from New York Police Department to continue special attention to Soviet
                            delegation premises in order to prevent any disorderly or unlawful acts
                            which would interfere with their work.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZAV1">Zakharov</persName> then made three points in
                            regard to statement, (1) fact that, what he termed hostile anti-Soviet,
                            demonstrations occurred one hour daily indicated these were not
                            spontaneous but organized, (2) that incident of December 11 when he said
                            Soviet women were insulted and “hooliganism” was committed against male
                            Soviet employee, showed these demonstrations could not be called
                            peaceful, (and here <persName corresp="#p_ZAV1">Zakharov</persName> gave
                            whole show away by reading from typewritten paper he had in folder) that
                            U.S. authorities obviously do not wish to offer proper protection
                            against hostile demonstrations interfering with work of mission and
                            although, as indicated December <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0189"
                            />17, Ministry hoped avoid publicity, they now had no recourse in light
                            of information but to publish notes and other material regarding this
                            matter which would not pass “unnoticed” by Soviet opinion and could not
                            but affect attitude of population of capital toward American embassy in
                            Moscow.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_ZAV1">Zakharov</persName> I had informed Mr.
                            Gromyko peaceful picketing and demonstrations were permitted by our law,
                            but the information I had given him and the assurances from New York
                            Police Department made it perfectly clear that prompt and effective
                            action would be taken against any disorder or attempt interfere with
                            work Soviet mission; that demonstrations for one hour daily were kept
                            off sidewalk in front of building and that December 11, to which he
                            referred, offenders had been promptly arrested. I said I wished to be
                            entirely clear as to what Soviet Government was asking. In view fact New
                            York authorities had done and would do everything that could be expected
                            to prevent any disorders or interference with work, was Soviet
                            Government in effect insisting that all peaceful picketing should be
                            forbidden by U.S. authorities.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZAV1">Zakharov</persName> at first took refuge in
                            general statement that they wished guarantees of conditions which would
                            not interfere with work of mission and finally, on my insistence,
                            admitted in their eyes any form “anti-Soviet” demonstration in their
                            opinion interfered with work of mission. I told him I could only report
                            his observations to my Government, but I knew that under our law
                            peaceful and orderly picketing kept at a distance from the premises was
                            permitted. I told him I gathered from his remark that Soviet Government
                            had decided give publicity this matter, to which he replied in the
                            affirmative repeating that they had no other recourse but declined to
                            tell me when publication would occur.</p>
                        <p>On leaving I told <persName corresp="#p_ZAV1">Zakharov</persName> since
                            no demonstrations occurred here without Government authorization I took
                            it to mean Soviet Government had determined to organize demonstrations,
                            mentioning an incident in connection with demonstrations against British
                            and French which made perfectly plain fact these were well organized
                            affairs. <persName corresp="#p_ZAV1">Zakharov</persName>, as might be
                            expected, denied this and said it was of course impossible predict
                            reaction population Moscow.</p>
                        <p>In circumstances I believe we can expect publication at any time and I
                            would like for background to brief American press here, giving them in
                            particular information contained <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"
                                >Deptel</gloss> 741 [<hi rend="italic">751</hi>] which I believe
                            makes abundantly plain rather exceptional measures taken by New York
                            Police. I would give this for background use only when Soviets publish,
                            and I believe I can rely on correspondents here to observe this.</p>
                        <p>I believe Department should be prepared release, when Soviets publicize
                            anything on this matter, summary account my discussions <pb n="164"
                                xml:id="pg_164" facs="0190"/>with Foreign Office (this and previous
                            message contain all necessary details). I would suggest particular
                            attention to veiled threat of demonstrations as given me by Gromyko and
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZAV1">Zakharov</persName> which in both cases
                            to effect publication “unwillingness” U.S. authorities take necessary
                            measures would arouse legitimate indignation Soviet public opinion and
                            would not be without effect on attitude of population capital toward
                            American Embassy in Moscow. While foregoing is not absolute quotation
                            since made orally, it is accurate rendition of sense.</p>
                        <p>It is of course not clear whether threat of demonstrations is bluff or
                            will actually occur. In any event, I believe we would have some advance
                            notice since in order preserve fiction “spontaneous” popular reaction
                            any demonstrations would probably not occur immediately upon
                            publication.</p>

                            documents had been received from the East German government requesting
                            that the information contained therein should be submitted to <gloss

                            Soviet item in the Special Political Committee. The letter alleged
                            action by the United States against the government of the Democratic
                            Peoples Republic of Germany, including radio propaganda attacks,
                            balloons, espionage, subversion, etc. [Name deleted] said that the
                            letter and documents had been transmitted to Pelt, director of the
                            European office of Geneva, who had forwarded them to the Secretary

                        <p>We told [name deleted] our immediate reaction was that East German
                            government had no status to request any documentation and that it would
                            be unduly dignifying the documentation for Secretariat to distribute it.
                            [Name deleted] pointed out that the Soviets could and probably would
                            request that the documents be circulated, which then the Secretariat
                            would have to do. I feel Soviets should have to ask for it and
                            Secretariat should not circulate without such a request.</p>

                            and rejection would keep them in proper perspective of obvious Soviet
                            propaganda move. On other hand if it appeared that decisive vote would
                            not be forthcoming on this basis or that substantial number members,
                            particularly among “neutralists”, felt there might be some substance to

                        <p>Explanatory Memorandum.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of the provisions of Chapters I and IV of the United Nations
                            Charter, the USSR delegation, acting on instructions from the Government
                            of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, deems it its duty to draw
                            the attention of all states members of the United Nations to aggressive
                            acts by the United States of America constituting a threat to peace and
                            security.</p>
                        <p>The reason why this question is raised now, when the Assembly is
                            approaching the end of its work, is that recently the United States of
                            America has taken new steps further straining relations among states and
                            increasing the danger of another war.</p>
                        <p>A serious study of the international situation leads to the inevitable
                            conclusion that whereas the majority of the world’s states are anxious
                            to ease the international tension and to wipe out the consequences of
                            the “cold war”, the United States Government is pursuing a policy
                            designed to strain and aggravate the international situation and to
                            create a war psychosis.</p>
                        <p>It was to have been expected that following the measures taken against
                            the Anglo-French-Israel aggression in Egypt and the cessation of
                            hostilities in the Middle East area the United States of America would,
                            together with other states, take further steps to bring the
                            international situation back to normal. That, however, was not the
                            case.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government has embarked on a policy of further
                            aggravating the situation in the Near and Middle East. The President’s
                            message to the Congress of 5 January 1957<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">For

                            the Near and Middle East, the economic and political enslavement of the
                            peoples of countries in this area and the planning of acts of
                            provocation conducive to war.</p>
                        <p>At the end of January 1957, there was an announcement of new measures
                            taken by the United States to intensify preparations for the unleashing
                            of an atomic war. Ruling circles in the United States not only refuse,
                            to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, but have begun to carry out a
                            plan for the establishment and stationing on the territories of other
                            states of special United States military units, armed with atomic
                            weapons. It is proposed to station such operational units in Western
                            Europe, Turkey, Iran, Japan and, in particular, on the island of
                            Okinawa. It is clear that such actions intensify the threat of a new
                            war.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, the purpose of these new plans is to avert the
                            principal retaliatory shock from the United States, in the event of the
                            unleashing of atomic war by United States ruling circles, and thus to
                            place under serious threat of a retaliatory atomic attack the peoples of
                            the countries in whose territories it is proposed to station United
                            States atomic military units, i.e., the peoples of the United Kingdom,
                            France, West Germany, Italy, Turkey, Iran, Japan and other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The recently announced draft military budget of the United States for
                            1957–1958 shows that military expenditure in the United States is being
                            increased and that the armaments race is being intensified. The draft
                            budget provides for military allocations, unprecedented in times of
                            peace, amounting to 45,300 million dollars, which considerably exceeds
                            similar allocations for 1956–1957, vast as those were.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of February 1957, it was announced that the already
                            extensive network of United States military bases on foreign territory
                            would be further expanded. It is stated, in particular, that a new
                            United States base will be established in Brazil, a base for jet
                            aircraft in Pakistan, a large new military base on Taiwan and that the
                            construction of many new air bases is being planned in West Germany. At
                            the same time, existing bases are being feverishly expanded and
                            modernized.</p>
                        <p>All these activities have been undertaken by the United States at a time
                            when peace-loving countries, particularly the Soviet Union, have
                            effected considerable reductions of their armed forces and have
                            considerably decreased their military expenditure.</p>
                        <p>Recently, there has also been considerable intensification of aggressive
                            military measures along the lines traced by the North Atlantic bloc and
                            other aggressive military groups headed by the United States. This is
                            borne out, in particular, by the fact that West Germany is being
                            compulsorily remilitarized and that the West <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172"
                                facs="0198"/>German army is being entrusted with atomic weapons.
                            Moreover, Hitlerite generals are being placed at the head of the armed
                            forces of the North Atlantic bloc.</p>
                        <p>The militarization of West Germany cannot fail to arouse anxiety among
                            all peace-loving countries, for it is well known that the leaders of the
                            North Atlantic bloc have assigned to West Germany the role of the main
                            shock troops in their aggressive plans.</p>
                        <p>Other recent steps taken by the United States with a view to aggravating
                            the international situation and creating situations endangering the
                            cause of peace are also well known.</p>
                        <p>The States members of the United Nations cannot disregard the
                            increasingly aggressive measures recently taken by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Delegation accordingly proposes that the General Assembly
                            should consider the item: “The Question of Aggressive Acts by the United
                            States of America Constituting a Threat to Peace and Security”.</p>
                        <p>Urgent consideration of this question by the General Assembly should
                            promote the united efforts of states members of the United Nations to
                            alleviate tension and to improve the international situation”.</p>

                                experience might now constructively be built upon to augment the

                                particularly those in the non-Communist world. I believe the

                                    in the United Nations was not right to discuss the idea of a
                                    permanent U.N. corps; however, he recommended that studies of

                                a position to make a proposal as soon as feasible. Such a proposal
                                is outlined in <gloss target="#t_TAB1">Tab</gloss> A, along with a

                                matter would be to ask the Secretary General to circulate for

                                establishment of a Permanent United Nations Force.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Facts Bearing on Problem</hi></p>
                            <p>2. The U.N. Charter provides for a military force composed of
                                national contingents functioning under the Security Council. This
                                provision has never been implemented because of political
                                differences among the permanent members of the Security Council.</p>
                            <p>3. United Nations military action in Korea in 1950 was in accordance
                                with Security Council resolutions passed in the absence of the USSR
                                representative, who had boycotted the Council. The United States was
                                the executive agent for the United Nations for the organization and
                                direction of the Unified Command.</p>
                            <p>4. The “Uniting for Peace” Resolution of 1950 provided the General
                                Assembly with the necessary authority to take military action in the
                                maintenance of peace when the Security Council failed to function.
                                The current United Nations Emergency Force (<gloss target="#t_UNEF1"
                                    >UNEF</gloss>) was organized under the <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                    >SYG</gloss> in accordance with this Resolution.</p>
                            <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> is composed of a
                                combination of contingents from member states other than permanent
                                members of Security Council. There is no executive agent, and it is
                                directed by <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> in accordance with
                                broad General Assembly resolutions and with advice of an Advisory
                                Committee. Precedent has been established that the host country must
                                voluntarily accept the force and can dictate the acceptability of
                                national contingents. The United States, though not contributing
                                forces, provides equipment, supply, transport and airlift for <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss>, and maintains liaison with
                                respect to these matters.</p>
                            <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> was established as an
                                emergency international force to secure and supervise the cessation
                                of hostilities in accordance with all the terms of General Assembly
                                resolution 997 (ES-I) of 2 November 1956.</p>
                            <p>7. Although the <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> was organized
                                on an “ad hoc” basis, some members of the United Nations Secretariat
                                and certain United Nations delegates have recently suggested the
                                desirability of extending the status of this force to a permanent or
                                long-range basis.</p>

                            <p>8. On 7 January 1957, a Resolution was introduced in the U.S. Senate
                                    (S.<gloss target="#t_res1">Res</gloss>. 15, 85th Congress, 1st

                                permanent arm of the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>9. Various other types of forces have been proposed in the past. The
                                “Foreign Legion” concept of internationally-recruited personnel
                                owing allegiance to the United Nations has been prominent among
                                these. Other proposals have been introduced in the Congress of the
                                United States.</p>

                            <p>It may be assumed that any permanent United Nations force would
                                conform in general to one of five types. There are of course many

                                only those listed below will be considered. The characteristics of

                                    government. The desirability or undesirability of a world

                                    reiterated, however, that the United Nations Charter did not
                                    contemplate a world government nor, in fact, have the de facto

                                    national sovereignty and self-interest.</item>

                                <item>It is assumed that because of the political cleavage in the

                                    This means that 2/3 of the Member States, regardless of their
                                    size and strength, will control its actions. Thus there is no
                                    assurance that the employment of this force would be in the
                                    interest of the United States and it could possibly result in
                                    its use to the contrary. Accordingly, some of the above

                                <item>A major point of difference in the deliberations of the
                                    Military Staff Committee and in the debate in the Security
                                    Council over the establishment of Article 43 forces in 1948, was
                                    the question of location of proposed forces when not being
                                    employed. (See Appendix A) Granted that this difference was
                                    political rather than technical, there is no reason to believe
                                    that the same problem would not arise in the establishment of
                                    any permanent force. Actually, the Charter type national
                                    contingents concept presents less of a problem in this respect
                                    as has been pointed out above in connection with training
                                    facilities.</item>

                                <item>It appears that the question of location of forces, including
                                    operating bases, could be more easily met under some sort of
                                    national contingent force rather than under a U.N.-controlled
                                    international permanent force. Thus, the supplying of bases and
                                    facilities as a part of the national contributions of the
                                    various states would tend to solve both the political and
                                    financial problems.</item>

                                    international force. Acting on a report from the
                                    Secretary-General, the General Assembly on 26 November passed a
                                    resolution (A/<gloss target="#t_res1">RES</gloss>/412)
                                    allocating $10,000,000 as an initial outlay to finance <gloss
                                        target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss>. Subsequently, in Committee 5
                                    of the General Assembly, an extended debate ensued as to how
                                    this cost should be distributed. The Soviet bloc flatly refused
                                    to contribute to this appropriation on the basis that the
                                    so-called aggressors in Egypt should be held financially
                                    responsible. Smaller nations, on the other hand, pleaded
                                    inability to contribute in accordance with the regular pro-rated
                                    assessment scale for U.N. budget. It was finally agreed to
                                    recommend that this initial outlay be distributed in proportion
                                    to the regular assessments. It was clearly indicated, however,
                                    that any subsequent outlays would be subject to further
                                    consideration.</item>

                            <p>19. Agreement among the permanent members of the Security Council
                                will not soon be reached in implementation of Charter provisions for
                                a U.N. force.</p>
                            <p>20. From the technical viewpoint, the “Unified Command” concept under
                                an executive agent state, as employed in Korea, offers the best
                                prospect for an efficient United Nations force.</p>
                            <p>21. Proposals for an internationally-recruited force owing allegiance
                                to the United Nations under direct control of a United Nations
                                agency are not technically feasible or politically acceptable.</p>
                            <p>22. Thus far the <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> is adequate
                                for the express purpose for which it was established. It should not,
                                however, be accepted as a pattern for a permanent force of greater
                                strength and size as a substitute for forces envisaged under Article
                                43 of the Charter.</p>
                            <p>23. United States will be expected to contribute logistical support
                                either in part or in full in the event of the establishment of any
                                United Nations force unless the force has been established by the
                                General Assembly sponsored by the USSR contrary to U.S.
                                interests.</p>
                            <p>24. Currently, most serious suggestions for the establishment of a
                                permanent U.N. force are directed toward an extension of the status

                        <p>The Special Political Committee of the General Assembly on February 27,
                            1957 rejected, by a vote of 53 to 8 (Soviet bloc), with 11 abstentions,
                            a Soviet draft resolution condemning the “subversive activities” of the
                            United States and calling upon it to cease such activities and
                            “intervention” in Eastern Europe. (This vote compares favorably with
                            past votes in the General Assembly on comparable Soviet complaints.)
                            Eight states were absent.</p>
                        <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0214"/>
                        <p>Those abstaining were Finland, Yugoslavia and nine Afro-Asians
                            (Afghanistan, Burma, Ceylon, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia,
                            Syria and Yemen). The abstentions of Finland and Afghanistan are
                            understandable on geographic grounds. While Egypt and Syria have
                            reflected pro-Soviet leanings in recent months, they may have considered
                            it preferable to abstain rather than support the Soviet complaint.
                            Moreover, they, as well as Saudi Arabia and Yemen, were undoubtedly
                            looking toward future Soviet support on the Middle East. The remaining
                            Afro-Asians are usually found among the so-called neutralists when “cold
                            war” matters are under consideration in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Of the eight absent states, two (Hungary and South Africa) have withdrawn
                            from participation in the work of the General Assembly; five are
                            Afro-Asians only recently admitted to membership, two (Jordan and Libya)
                            in December 1955 and three (Morocco, the Sudan and Tunisia) on November
                            12, 1956. This was the first occasion (setting aside the Hungarian
                            question where broader considerations were involved), that these five
                            were faced with a sharp US-Soviet issue, and they may have refrained
                            from voting because of: (1) ignorance of the issues involved; (2) desire
                            for Soviet support on future Middle East resolutions; or (3) because
                            they may not want to become involved in the “cold war”. The Austrian
                            Delegation explained to <gloss target="#t_USGADel1">USGAdel</gloss> that
                            Vienna had instructed the delegation to abstain, at the same time giving
                            it discretion to be absent on a roll-call vote.</p>
                        <p>In the plenary meeting this morning the Soviet Delegation did not
                            reintroduce its draft resolution, so there was no further vote. Only the
                            USSR and Czechoslovakia spoke in favor of the Soviet position. They were
                            answered by the United States and Brazil. There were no other
                            speakers.</p>

                            COMMITTEE</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Background</hi></p>
                        <p>The tenth <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> decided that a Charter review
                            conference “shall be held at an appropriate time,” and established a
                            committee of the whole “to consider, in consultation with the Secretary
                            General, the question of fixing a time and place for the Conference and
                            its organization and procedures.” This committee is to report to the
                            12th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, and the United States must
                            therefore determine the position it is to take in the committee when it
                            meets prior to the 12th session.</p>
                        <p>The adoption of the tenth <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> resolution
                            was in large measure the result of U.S. urging. While only the Soviet
                            bloc strongly opposed the idea of Charter review, there was no pressure
                            for an early conference. Doubt about the possibilities of accomplishment
                            at such a conference in the absence of a more favorable political
                            climate was widespread. Neutralist members were influenced by the Soviet
                            position. They, and others, feared that a conference might exacerbate
                            East-West differences. The anti-colonial and underdeveloped countries
                            saw little chance of amendments they might favor receiving the necessary
                            major-power ratifications. The older colonial powers and more developed
                            countries were apprehensive about the pressures that might build up at
                            such a conference for Charter changes they could not accept. The U.S. in
                            principle strongly favored the holding of a conference, but did not wish
                            it held in 1956—an election year. The British would have preferred to
                            see any decision on holding a conference deferred until 1960.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> discussions in 1955 produced very
                            little in the way of concrete proposals for change. Preparatory to these
                            discussions, a Department working group prepared twenty position papers
                            on various substantive aspects of Charter review, but these papers were
                            never finalized nor advanced beyond the working level. (A list of these
                            papers is annexed.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">Not printed.</note>) Since
                            1955, there has been almost no <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0216"
                            />discussion of Charter review in official circles either here or
                            abroad. The Secretary, however, has on a number of occasions, reiterated
                            his interest in the institution of some type of weighted voting in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Committee’s Terms of
                            Reference</hi></p>
                        <p>The first decision before the committee (and the United States) is
                            whether to favor the calling of a conference. The <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> committee is free to recommend to the 12th session
                            against a decision now to hold a review conference on the ground that it
                            is not “an appropriate time” since the “auspicious international
                            circumstances” referred to in the tenth <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> resolution do not prevail. If this first decision is
                            negative, the others concerning place, organization, and procedures
                            would automatically be postponed.</p>
                        <p>The committee’s terms of reference as set forth in the tenth <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> resolution are procedural and not
                            substantive. However, some substantive discussion may be difficult to
                            avoid. The individual members will have to give at least preliminary
                            consideration to substance in order to reach a position on whether or
                            not the scheduling of a conference is desirable, and this consideration
                            may be reflected in the subsequent committee discussion. Moreover, India
                            at the last <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> made specific mention of
                            this committee in connection with its proposal that the composition of
                            the Security Council be studied “in all its aspects.” It is therefore
                            not unlikely that India may try to raise this matter in committee
                            despite the 11th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> decision to postpone
                            further consideration of the “enlargement” items until the 12th
                            session.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">U.S. Preparations</hi></p>
                        <p>If the consensus of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership
                            clearly and strongly favors the convening of a Charter review conference
                            in the near future, it would appear difficult for this Government to
                            fail to support such a move in view of our previous statements within
                            this country and at the tenth <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.
                            Moreover, a refusal to review is difficult to defend intellectually and
                            for us to join the USSR, or even all the other permanent <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members, in opposing a conference would
                            appear to many other members as a failure to fulfill what they regard as
                            a tacit commitment given at the San Francisco Conference in 1945.</p>
                        <p>If, however, there is no clear consensus in favor of convening a
                            conference, and there is no indication of one at present, we should
                            weigh very carefully whether the holding of a review conference at this
                            time is really in the U.S. interest. One of our principal concerns—the
                            membership deadlock—has been met, and enlargement of <pb n="191"
                                xml:id="pg_191" facs="0217"/>the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Councils responsive to the increased membership is already on the 12th
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>’s agenda. There would appear to be
                            little chance of obtaining effective agreement on another principal
                            objective—restricting the use of the veto—not only because of Soviet
                            opposition but also because British and French support for such a move
                            at this juncture seems unlikely. Our own position on this matter has
                            been complicated by the fact that with the growing membership of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the projected enlargement of
                            the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, a friendly Council will become
                            increasingly difficult to ensure. If a review conference is held, the
                            questions of the permanent seats on the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> and of Chinese representation seems inescapable. While
                            the Charter requirements of a two-thirds vote and ratification by the
                            five permanent members of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            guarantee us against any unacceptable amendments, long and acrimonious
                            debate of these highly controversial issues could be seriously
                            prejudicial to U.S. and free-world interests.</p>
                        <p>We should therefore carefully weigh what we could reasonably expect to
                            gain at this time from a Charter review conference against the hazards
                            one presents for us. This calls for a careful review of the 1955 series

                            validity, and their probable acceptability to others in the present
                            situation. We should then, before finalizing our position for the
                            committee-of-the-whole session, take informal soundings with friendly
                            members and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretariat to
                            ascertain what if any pressure exists, and where, for holding a
                            conference in the near future.</p>
                        <p>If it is clear that there is no consensus among the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership in favor of a conference now
                            and if we decide not to press for the convening of a conference under
                            these circumstances, the development of detailed positions on place,
                            organization, and procedures of such a conference would be
                            premature.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Committee Session Tactics</hi></p>
                        <p>Our primary tactical problem when the committee of the whole meets will
                            be to avoid, so far as possible, substantive discussion. To this end, a
                            brief meeting under a strong chairman, who would hold the committee to
                            its terms of reference under the tenth <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            resolution, is desirable.</p>
                        <p>If no strong pressure for a conference in the near future develops, the
                            committee should be able to reach a decision on a negative
                            recommendation with the minimum of discussion. If, however, there are
                            pressures for an early conference, then it would appear desirable to
                            limit the number of meetings of the full committee and to have the
                            questions of place, organization, and procedures taken up in
                            subcommittees, both in order to expedite the work and to minimize <pb
                                n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0218"/>the inducement to substantive
                            discussion inherent in a forum of all <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            members.</p>
                        <p>While a meeting early in the summer would probably attract less
                            high-level representation, it might also prolong the proceedings. On
                            balance, it would seem preferable that the committee meet either in late
                            August or early September, just before the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss>. This timing would serve to emphasize the committee’s
                            procedural character and the need for an expeditious transaction of its
                            business. A meeting during the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> might
                            facilitate an Indian move to interject into the committee the
                            “enlargement” items on the agenda of the 12th session.</p>

                        <p>The committee of the whole established by the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> at its 10th session to report to the 12th session “on
                            the question of fixing a time and place” for a Charter review conference
                            and on the organization and procedures of such a conference is scheduled
                            to meet on June 3. The 10th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            specifically recognized in its resolution that a review “should be
                            conducted under auspicious international circumstances”, and decided to
                            hold a conference for this purpose “at an appropriate time.” It was the
                            consensus at the 10th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> that auspicious
                            circumstances did not then exist. It was clearly understood that while
                            the Assembly had taken a decision in principle to hold a conference, its
                            committee of the whole was free to recommend further postponement of the
                            decision on time and place if, in its view, international circumstances
                            were still not auspicious when the time came for the committee to
                            report.</p>
                        <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0219"/>
                        <p>The present political climate does not appear any more conducive to
                            positive accomplishment at a review conference than that prevailing in
                            1955–56. One of our principal concerns in supporting the holding of a
                            conference, the membership deadlock, has been met. Another principal
                            concern, enlargement of the Security Council and the Economic and Social
                            Council to permit more equitable geographic representation, is already
                            on the agenda of the 12th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. There
                            appears no greater likelihood than in the past that the USSR will agree
                            to any restriction of the veto power, and the raising of colonial and
                            other questions likely to prove divisive for the free world appears
                            certain. Moreover, the Chinese representation issue is certain to give
                            rise to extensive debate at any review conference in connection with the
                            conference’s consideration of the over-all composition of the Security
                            Council, which even if the number of non-permanent <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> seats has been increased, appears
                            inescapable.</p>
                        <p>On balance, it appears that the dangers in a review conference at this
                            time outweigh possible advantages. However, if the consensus among other
                            members is clearly in favor of a conference in the near future, it would
                            be difficult, both from the standpoint of principle and in view of our
                            past position on this matter, for the US to fail to support such a
                            move.</p>

                            this question.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> handed the Secretary
                            the annexed memorandum,<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Supra</hi>.</note> and outlined in more detail the reasons
                                <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> tended to be negative toward a
                            charter review conference at this time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1"
                                >Wilcox</persName> said that he had discussed this also with Jim
                            Barco (who is in full agreement with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>) and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJW1">Barco</persName> agreed with our thinking. Our
                            conclusion was that the Committee of the Whole should be kept in being,
                            but should be instructed to report again to the 13th General
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary indicated that the only two real goals of charter review
                            now would be some system of weighted voting, and the elimination of the
                            veto power (insofar as the peaceful settlement of disputes is concerned)
                            in the Security Council. Now that the new members had come into the
                            United Nations, their entrance was no longer a selling point; and their
                            presence would make any other change more difficult to achieve.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary also commented that some <gloss target="#t_NGO1"
                                >NGO</gloss> (as, for example, the US Committee for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) would be the proper organization to
                            build up a ground swell for a change such as weighted voting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded by suggesting that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> call in the British and French
                            and inquire of them their attitude toward any movement, through charter
                            review, of achieving such goals as a weighted voting system, with the
                            consequent corollary of a larger role for the General Assembly. The
                            Secretary felt we should maintain a neutral attitude toward the whole
                            matter until we had the British and French views.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary also commented that there were a number of procedural
                            problems and similar problems which might usefully be considered at any
                            conference such as a charter review conference, but which could be
                            solved without amending the Charter. He felt that this should be borne
                            in mind in any consideration of the objectives to be sought from and the
                            achievements which could be gained by a charter review conference.</p>

                            several times to possibility he may no longer be <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> next year. Most recent occasion was during report of
                            his visit to Jerusalem. Ben Gurion had referred to <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s personal role in helping establish
                            peaceful situation in ME and hoped he could do something further next
                            year. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> told us that he had commented
                            that perhaps he might not be available.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s references have been nothing more
                            than asides. We have no real impression from him whether he seriously

                            6. He stated that Nitze’s paper had been circulated in the Bureau of
                            International Organization Affairs and expressed pleasure that Nitze had
                            sent a copy to the Policy Planning Staff since the Staff “has an even
                            more direct interest in the background setting” within which such a
                            United Nations force might be used. “I have found that too often the
                            concept of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force is considered in
                            exclusively idealistic terms rather than in light of the world context

                                >Wilcox</persName> continued. He added that the United Nations
                            Emergency Force created for use in Egypt during the Suez crisis of 1956
                            “required a special political composition designed to meet the needs and
                            to avoid the pitfalls of that particular situation, which well might be
                            inappropriate for any given further situation.” <persName

                        <p>At the 11th Session of the General Assembly it was agreed that early in
                            the 12th Session the General Assembly would review all the factors
                            affecting cost sharing with a view to giving new criteria to the
                            Committee on Contributions to guide them in developing a new scale of

                        <p>In light of the following considerations, the United States will press
                            for a reduction in the maximum share to be assessed against the largest
                            contributor from 33⅓ per cent to 30.00.</p>

                                principle, not of what the United States can afford to pay. The

                                    corresp="#p_VAH1">Vandenberg</persName> in 1946, has always been
                                that, for purposes of the regular United Nations budget, the
                                assessment of the highest contributor is a question of what is right
                                and wise and just as among partners in a common enterprise.</item>

                            <item>The United Nations has accepted this position from the very
                                beginning in fixing the assessment of the highest contributor. In
                                1946, although it was estimated that relative United States capacity
                                to pay was then 60 per cent and the Contributions Committee proposed
                                a United States assessment of 49.89 per cent, the General Assembly,
                                while agreeing to fix assessments in general “broadly according to
                                capacity to pay”, fixed the assessment of the highest contributor
                                (United States) arbitrarily at 39.89 per cent, or roughly at
                                two-thirds of relative capacity to pay.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Assuming that the membership of the United Nations had remained
                                the same and that the same arbitrary standard was applied now, as in
                                1946, to fixing the assessment of the highest contributor, then the
                                United States, now said to have relative capacity to pay of 40–45
                                per cent, would be assessed two-thirds of that, or less than 30 per
                                cent. Thus, despite the great increase in the relative capacity to
                                pay of the other United Nations members, the United States, at
                                present assessment level of 33⅓ per cent, now pays more in relation
                                to its relative capacity than it did in 1946.</item>

                            <item>Moreover, United Nations membership has not remained the same.
                                Since 1946 membership has increased from 51 to 81, an increase of
                                more than 60 per cent. More importantly, since 1948, when the
                                General Assembly recognized that the assessment of the highest
                                contributor should not exceed 33⅓ per cent, membership has increased
                                from 58 to 81, an increase of about 40 per cent.</item>

                            <item>Such an increase in membership, as a matter of principle and
                                wholly without relation to capacity to pay, should be accompanied in
                                an organization of sovereign equals by a reduction in the maximum
                                assessment share of the regular budget to be borne by any one
                                country.</item>

                            <item>When in 1948 the principle of a one-third maximum assessment on
                                the highest contributor was recognized by the General Assembly and
                                the United Nations had only 58 members, this meant the United States
                                should pay twenty times its membership percentage, which was 1.72
                                per cent. At present in an organization of 81 members, the United
                                States represents only 1.25 per cent of total membership, and it
                                pays, on a 33⅓ per cent assessment basis, twenty-six times its
                                membership percentage. This increase cannot be justified in an
                                organization of sovereign equals, particularly where there has been
                                a large increase in the capacity to pay of other members in relation
                                to the United States.</item>

                        <p>For several years the United States Congress and the American public have
                            been giving generous support to a number of multilateral and bilateral
                            programs in the international field which in a variety of ways have
                            helped to achieve the aims of the United <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201"
                                facs="0227"/>Nations. The cost to the United States of these
                            programs each year is many times the amount of the United States
                            contribution to the annual budget of the United Nations, and this cost
                            has been met willingly—with no feeling that this voluntary action was
                            unfair or inequitable. Sentiment has already been expressed in the
                            Congress that the United States is being unfairly treated in the United
                            Nations on the question of the assessment scale. A continued refusal by
                            the General Assembly to alter the scale may well encourage this
                            sentiment. The United States would hope to see no situation develop in
                            respect to this question which could be a factor in bringing about a
                            negative reaction on the part of the American public toward United
                            States support for both multilateral and bilateral programs.</p>

                        <p>Although the OAS contribution scale is based with some modifications on

                            distinguished from the United Nations contribution on the basis of the

                        <p>In my conversation with Chetchetkin today, he asked whether I thought
                            that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> would be
                            reelected. I replied in the <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0229"
                            />affirmative, saying I saw no other candidates in the field and that I
                            knew of no reason why the US would not support <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I asked Chetchetkin about the Soviet position on this matter. He said
                            that the Soviet attitude towards <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> was “positive” but that no final decision
                            concerning his reelection had been taken by the Soviet Government. He
                            said that he knew of no other candidates for the position.</p>
                        <p>Chetchetkin then asked whether I thought it would be desirable to have
                            the election of the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> occur early in
                            the Assembly session. I answered in the affirmative, saying that I
                            thought it would be helpful in connection with a number of decisions to
                            be taken in the Assembly to know as soon as possible who would be the
                            Secretary General for the next five years. I pointed out that, for
                            example, the Fifth Committee would be making recommendations to the
                            Secretary General relating to personnel policy and that, certainly for
                            this purpose, it would be helpful to know to whom the recommendations
                            were being addressed. When I asked Chetchetkin what the Soviet
                            Delegation thought about the timing of the Secretary General’s election,
                            he was hesitant about a reply. He said that there were really several
                            important questions which probably ought to be settled first and that,
                            since <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s contract did
                            not expire until next spring, there was no urgency about his election.
                            He then said that probably the Soviet attitude on this point would
                            depend upon its attitude towards <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>’s election. If the Soviets favored his
                            election, they might well agree to have the election held early.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi></p>
                        <p>From Chetchetkin’s remarks, I think it quite possible that the Soviets,
                            even though favoring <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                            >Hammarskjold</persName>’s election, might think it best to hold off the
                            election until late in the Assembly in order to hold a weapon over
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s head. They
                            might well believe he would be more cooperative on items like the
                            Hungarian question if his election was still in abeyance.<note n="2"

                            Tuesday, September 17th, 1957. We anticipate that the eleventh regular

                        <p>When the 12th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> opens, it will comprise
                            81 members, including five new members admitted since the opening of the
                            11th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and sixteen members admitted by
                            the 10th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> in 1955. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has expanded from 60 to 81 members within
                            fifteen months. In this period the number of non-Communist European
                            states increased from ten to sixteen; the number of members from Asia
                            and Africa rose from seventeen to twenty-eight; and the number of Soviet
                            orbit members increased from five to nine. The number of members from
                            the old Commonwealth (4), from Latin America (20) or otherwise
                            classified (4) remained constant.</p>
                        <p>Several organizational and tactical problems arise from this expanded
                            membership. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> Members from
                            non-Communist Europe, the Old Commonwealth (Australia, Canada, New
                            Zealand, and Union of South Africa), and Latin America together with the
                            U.S. total 41, or, theoretically, a simple majority; while members from
                            Asia and Africa mathematically constitute 28 or one-third plus one. In
                            practice, of course, members do not vote solely on the grounds of
                            geographical location. Indeed, such a situation would be undesirable.
                            Nevertheless, the composition of the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            necessitates more than ever that members consult and accommodate
                            themselves to one another if they wish to gain <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> approval for proposed <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            programs or avoid what they consider undesirable. As a hypothetical
                            example, also <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>, it may be seen that
                            were the US to sponsor a resolution requiring a two-thirds vote for
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> adoption and if it were supported
                            by all the Latin Americans, non-Communist Europeans, and Old
                            Commonwealth members, which is not always the case, thirteen more
                            affirmative votes would still be needed if all members cast their votes
                                <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0233"/>either affirmatively or
                            negatively. Thus, assuming the Soviet orbit and others may be in
                            opposition, at least thirteen affirmative votes would have to be sought
                            from among China (which customarily supports us), Israel, Yugoslavia and
                            the Arab, African, and Asian members, specifically, eleven Arab, three
                            remaining African, and fourteen remaining Asian. End <gloss

                        <p>There has been evidence of some apprehension, particularly among European
                            members with dependent territories, respecting the present composition
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_FYI1"
                                >FYI</gloss> Some of these European governments have expressed the
                            feeling that they can no longer expect objective treatment from the
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> on any issue that has “colonial”
                            connotations. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. It is apparent,
                            however, that a substantial number of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            members share (a) a critical attitude in matters affecting dependent
                            areas and (b) a pre-disposition for causes invoking the rights of
                            peoples and nations to self-determination. These views are held by some
                            members in each geographical area and are not exclusive to one.</p>
                        <p>Most of the major colonial questions which will come before the 12th
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, e.g., Algeria, Cyprus,
                            recommendations concerning international respect for the right of
                            peoples and nations to self-determination, and the attainment of
                            self-government or independence by Trust Territories, to cite but
                            several, will stimulate expressions of these views. In our opinion, a
                            principal challenge to the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> will be how
                            to encourage desirable progress without exacerbating existing
                            controversies and tensions. Like its predecessors, the 12th <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> will also have before it unsettled
                            problems which continue to impede good relations such as those between
                            Israel and the Arab states and those involving South Africa. Unlike
                            them, the 12th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> will also have to
                            consider how to continue to finance the United Nations Emergency
                            Force.</p>

                        <p>We desire, as in previous years, to consult informally with friendly
                            governments prior to the opening of the Assembly concerning major agenda
                            items. These consultations should be held on the basis of our tentative
                            views or general objectives in order that we may be able to take the
                            views of other governments into account when formulating our final
                            positions. In some cases, however, you will observe our position has
                            already been determined (e.g., para. D, items 1, 2, 3, 4, and parts of 5
                            and 6 below). The items dealt with in this instruction are those which
                            would be considered in the Assembly’s political committees and/or
                            plenary; other important items dealt with in the other five Main
                            Committees will be treated in other instructions as appropriate,
                                e.g.,<gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> 665 of July 19th. You are
                            requested, in your discretion, to outline this government’s views or
                            objectives to the foreign office and to report its reactions as soon as
                            possible. As noted above, you should state that these views, except as
                            otherwise indicated, are tentative and that we shall wish to take into
                            account, insofar as possible, the views of other friendly governments in
                            determining our ultimate position. Your approach at addressee capital
                            will be paralleled by consultations with the permanent missions in New
                            York through <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> and in some cases

                        <p>Three items on the agenda of the Eleventh General Assembly were postponed
                            until the Twelfth Session after inconclusive debate on the
                            first—increasing the number of non-permanent seats on the Security
                            Council. The other two items, which were never taken up, concerned
                            enlargement of the Economic and Social Council and of the International
                            Court of Justice. All three items had originated with a varying number
                            of Latin American members and Spain, and arose out of the new situation
                            created by the greatly enlarged membership of the U.N. The first two
                            involved amendment of the Charter, and the third amendment of the
                            Statute of the Court. The United States was prepared to support the
                            enlargement of the Security Council and of the Economic and Social
                            Council by two and four, respectively, but opposed any increase in the
                            size of the Court.</p>
                        <p>The debate at the Eleventh Session made it appear highly unlikely that an
                            increase of the Security Council by only two non-permanent seats would
                            be acceptable to the majority of Members. At the same time, those
                            pressing for a larger increase could not agree on exactly what they
                            wanted. A resolution co-sponsored by a group of African and Asian states
                            called for the establishment of a special committee to study the
                            composition of the Security Council “in all its aspects”, thus obviously
                            referring to the permanent as well as the non-permanent seats. The
                                <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> made its agreement on
                            any increase conditional 1) on a seat for Eastern Europe and 2) on the
                            settlement in its favor of the Chinese representation issue.</p>
                        <p>The Department is currently reviewing its position on these three items

                            of information relating to the effects of atomic radiation on human
                            health and safety. In December 1955, the Assembly appointed a special
                            scientific committee of 15 member governments (including the U.S.) to
                            collect, review, evaluate, and distribute reports received from
                            governments on (1) observed levels of radiation in the environment and
                            (2) scientific observations and experiments relevant to the effects of
                            ionizing radiation upon man and his environment.</p>
                        <p>The Committee will hold its 4th meeting this fall when it will begin
                            formulation of its report which is due by July 1, 1958. This report will
                            deal with the data that has been collected on levels of radiation and
                            the effects of this radiation on man and his environment.</p>
                        <p>In view of the active role already assumed by the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Scientific Committee, it is not unlikely
                            Czechoslovakia’s motive in requesting inclusion of this item is for
                            propaganda purposes, and in particular with respect to advancing
                            proposals for unconditional ending of tests and prohibiting the use of
                            atomic weapons.</p>

                            situation in which so few governments carry the main burden is not a
                            healthy one. We hope that broader and more adequate support for <gloss

                        <p>Two items involving Cyprus were inscribed in the agenda of the 11th

                            simultaneously. The Greek item called for the application of the

                            and the British item concerned support from Greece for terrorism in
                            Cyprus. By a vote of 57 to 0 with one abstention, the Assembly on
                            February 26, 1957 adopted an Indian compromise resolution expressing the

                            that negotiations would be resumed and continued to this end. Neither
                            Greece nor the UK pressed their own proposals to a vote.</p>

                        <p>The 11th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> on February 15, 1957, adopted
                            by a unanimous vote (77-0; South Africa and Hungary absent) a moderate
                            compromise resolution on Algeria co-sponsored by Italy, Argentina,

                            Philippines. The resolution expressed the hope that a “peaceful,
                            democratic, and just” solution would be found, through appropriate
                            means, in conformity with the principles of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Charter. On July 18, 21 Arab, Asian and African states
                            requested inclusion of the question of Algeria in the provisional agenda
                            of the 12th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> In the event that there has been no
                            significant progress made toward a settlement of the Algerian problem by
                            this fall, it is anticipated that there will be a strong Arab, Asian and

                            action than that taken last February. It is conceivable that
                            negotiations between the French Government and the Algerian rebel
                            leadership looking toward the conclusion of a cease-fire and the
                            implementation of the Mollet Plan will have been undertaken by this
                            fall. Such a development would be of the utmost significance and would
                            serve to deflect in large measure efforts to press this issue too far at
                            the 12th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. However, the prospects for
                            implementation of the Mollet Plan do not appear to be particularly
                            promising at present. In this connection, it appears that France may now
                            be vulnerable to the charge that it has in considerable measure backed
                            away from or “watered down” the Mollet Plan as outlined in detail by
                            former French Foreign Minister Pineau to the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> last February. This is of importance since the US
                            predicated its position at the 11th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            largely on the ground that this program as outlined offered a reasonable
                            prospect of advancing an Algerian settlement and hence the 11th Assembly
                            should avoid taking any action which might hamper the carrying out of
                            the French program.</p>
                        <p>The Department has held discussions with French officials in Washington
                            during which we took a friendly but firm line concerning the urgent need
                            for a solution of the Algerian problem. We were informed that France
                            will not oppose inscription of Algeria at the 12th <gloss

                        <p>It is suggested that Missions take the following line as appropriate in
                            responding to inquiries concerning the US position on Algeria in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>: While we would be opposed to the

                            session. Although we would be opposed to any action at the 12th session
                            which does not seem likely to make a contribution to a solution of the

                            action the U.S. might support since this will depend in large measure

                        <p>It has been Soviet practice in recent years to put forward what has come
                            to be known as “the Soviet item” which sets forth the current Soviet
                            propaganda line. At the 11th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, the USSR
                            submitted two such items. The first was obviously a defensive reaction
                            to the events in Hungary and was inscribed under the title: “Complaint

                            rejected a <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> resolution
                            which contained the above charges by a roll-call vote, 53 against, 8 in

                            attract the support of those delegations anxious to see a lessening of
                            East-West tensions.</p>
                        <p>The U.S., of course, remains ready to cooperate with the <gloss

                            concrete measures to facilitate a peaceful solution of the various
                            outstanding issues. We, nevertheless, believe it important that the
                            Soviets not be permitted in the guise of an innocuously worded
                            resolution to obscure vital issues and to gain credit for a willingness
                            to negotiate sincerely when such is not supported by concrete evidence.
                            In this latter connection, we shall wish to cooperate closely with all
                            non-Soviet delegations on procedures for dealing with any such spurious
                            proposals in a manner best calculated to maintain our common
                            objectives.</p>

                                    >Sprague</persName></hi>: As you are aware, considerable
                            interest has been expressed in Congress and elsewhere in the United
                            Nations Emergency Force as a possible prototype or forerunner to a
                            multinational United Nations Force to deal with such matters as
                            political disputes and actual or potential armed conflicts. A number of
                            resolutions have been submitted in the House and Senate calling for the
                            establishment of a permanent United Nations Force for these
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>The existence of various situations where the carrying out of observation
                            or patrol operations by a United Nations body might either deter the
                            outbreak of hostilities or facilitate the cessation of hostilities after
                            they have broken out suggests that the <gloss target="#t_UNEF1"
                                >UNEF</gloss> experience might now constructively be built upon to
                            augment the available tools for dealing with international disputes,
                            particularly those in the non-Communist world.</p>
                        <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0247"/>
                        <p>With the foregoing considerations in mind, the Department of State is
                            considering whether it would be desirable and feasible to sponsor or
                            support a proposal in the 12th General Assembly for the development of a
                            permanent <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force. The Department has
                            developed some very preliminary ideas of a possible proposal for the
                            establishment of a permanent force along the lines of the attached
                            paper. You will note that the concept which we have in mind is very
                            general in form; it is intended to be only a starting point for
                            tentative discussions with other Departments of Government which might
                            be concerned.</p>
                        <p>I would suggest that a discussion might be arranged between staff members
                            of the Departments of State and Defense for the purpose of examining
                            these ideas and, if they are found to have merit, of developing them
                            further. If the eventual outcome of the discussions should be an agreed
                            US Government position on the matter, we would propose that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should be consulted
                            regarding the desirability of introducing an appropriate proposal in the
                            12th General Assembly. A decision could then be reached in the light of
                            all available facts as to whether to take such an initiative, and if so,
                            when.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate it if you would let me know at your earliest
                            convenience whether the Department of Defense would be prepared to
                            nominate a member or members of its staff to enter into discussions such
                            as I have suggested.</p>

                                    a force would clearly be in the US interest, and we should not
                                    leave the full financial burden to the lesser powers. The

                                    contributing nations, who would receive appropriate credits
                                    against their assessments. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>

                        <p>Article 109(3) of the U.N. Charter provides that if a general conference
                            to review the Charter has not been held by the Tenth Session of the
                            General Assembly, the proposal to call such a conference shall be placed
                            on the agenda of that session. No such conference having been held by
                            1955, this question therefore appeared automatically on the agenda of
                            the Tenth General Assembly. The Assembly adopted by a vote of 43 (U.S.)
                            to 6 (Soviet bloc and Syria), with 9 abstentions a resolution,
                            co-sponsored by the United States, the United Kingdom, and five other
                            members, expressing the belief that review of the Charter “under
                            auspicious international circumstances” is desirable and deciding that a
                            general conference to review the Charter “shall be held at an
                            appropriate time.” The resolution then established the committee whose
                            report is before the current session of the Assembly. There was general
                            agreement at the Tenth Session that the Assembly’s action constituted a
                            decision in principle to hold a review conference and at the same time
                            took into account the necessity for a more favorable political climate
                            than that then prevailing if the potential benefits of a review
                            conference were to be fully realized. Only the Soviet bloc opposed the
                            idea of Charter review, its members stating that they would therefore
                            not participate in the Committee.</p>
                        <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0252"/>
                        <p>It was the general understanding at that time that the Committee had the
                            authority to recommend further postponement of the decision on the time
                            and place of the review conference if in its opinion international
                            circumstances are still not auspicious for the holding of the
                            conference, and the Committee acted on this understanding. The United
                            States, in supporting this action, referred to the general agreement
                            among Committee members that the “appropriate time referred to in the
                            Tenth General Assembly’s resolution had not yet arrived” and reaffirmed
                            its belief that the review conference “should be held when circumstances
                            are auspicious.” The phrase “no later than its fourteenth session” in
                            the Committee’s resolution reflects the U.S. view that the Committee
                            should be free to report earlier if circumstances warrant. The Soviet
                            bloc, contrary to previous statements, participated in the meeting of
                            the Committee but abstained on the resolution, after its members had
                            declared their continued opposition to the holding of any review
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>While the United States and the United Kingdom were co-sponsors of the
                            Tenth General Assembly resolution, none of the major powers was included
                            among the sponsors of the Committee resolution—Brazil, Canada, Egypt, El
                            Salvador, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Iran, Liberia, and Panama. In view
                            of the fact that Article 109(3) was included in the Charter in deference
                            to the views of the smaller states, it may prove desirable to leave the
                            sponsorship of the Assembly resolution to them.</p>
                        <p>The vote on the Committee’s resolution points to its acceptance by the

                            been no indications to the contrary since the Committee’s meeting in
                            June. This should permit expeditious handling of the item directly in
                            plenary, which would be consistent with the handling of the original
                            item at the Tenth General Assembly and serve to discourage any
                            substantive discussion.<note n="4" xml:id="d80fn4">On October 14, the

                        <p>In recent years, we have normally followed the practice of abstaining or
                            voting against Soviet-bloc candidates, depending on the circumstances in
                            each case. This has not usually prevented their election, the notable
                            exception being the Security Council, and it has created certain
                            problems for us in the pursuit of other objectives. (See attached
                            memorandum.) Our unwillingness to vote for the USSR has made it
                            increasingly difficult for us to argue convincingly that other members
                            should vote for China’s re-election to various <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> bodies on which the permanent members of the Security
                            Council are traditionally represented. Moreover, it is to our advantage
                            to have the USSR represented on certain <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> bodies, for example, the Advisory Committee on
                            Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Committee on
                            Contributions. The Soviet-bloc candidate is sometimes, because of a
                            particular circumstance, a desirable addition to a technical body from
                            the standpoint of US interests in that body. Where Soviet-bloc
                            candidacies are uncontested and their success a foregone conclusion our
                            refusal to vote for them under any circumstances appears unduly rigid in
                            the eyes of other governments, particularly as the USSR and its
                            satellites do not follow a comparable practice with respect to the US.
                            In the case of Poland, our refusal to vote for Soviet-bloc candidates
                            appears inconsistent with our current policy toward that country. Such
                            problems as these have for some time cast doubt on the wisdom of our
                            continuing to follow a hard and fast line in this matter, and we twice
                            departed from our usual practice in 1956 by supporting a Czech for
                            Vice-President of the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Conference
                            and Poland for election to the Economic and Social Council.</p>
                        <p>At the forthcoming General Assembly, the USSR will again be a candidate
                            for one of the vice-presidencies (as will the US, UK, <pb n="228"
                                xml:id="pg_228" facs="0254"/>France, and China) and presumably for
                            re-election to the Advisory Committee and the Committee on
                            Contributions. There will as usual be a Soviet-bloc candidate for one of
                            the seven main committee chairmanships. Czechoslovakia is a candidate
                            for election to succeed the Philippines on the Security Council, and
                            Judge Winiarski of Poland is a candidate for re-election to the
                            International Court of Justice. If the usual pattern prevails, all these
                            candidacies will be successful except that of Czechoslovakia for the
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, where Japan is the rival

                                CANDIDATES</head>
                            <p><gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> has from the beginning (September
                                1953) expressed reservation about the policy of not voting for the
                                USSR in cases where the five permanent members of the Security
                                Council are traditionally represented because of the bearing of this
                                policy on our efforts to maintain unimpaired the Republic of China’s
                                standing within the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as one of the
                                Big Five. In seeking the re-election of China to <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> bodies, probably our most effective
                                argument with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members who are
                                unsympathetic toward the Republic of China is that the five
                                permanent members of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> are
                                traditionally represented. This argument becomes increasingly
                                difficult to use when it is <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0255"
                                />generally known that we do not vote for the USSR in the same
                                circumstances.</p>
                            <p>The desirability of continuing this policy has also been questioned
                                in the case of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Advisory
                                Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Committee on Contributions, and the
                                Narcotics Commission, on the ground that some of our objectives in
                                these particular bodies are served by Soviet or Soviet-bloc
                                participation.</p>
                            <p>The U.S. Delegation to the Economic and Social Council in 1956 asked
                                for reconsideration of this policy on the ground that it interfered
                                seriously with the Delegation’s ability to negotiate acceptable
                                “slates” for the functional commissions and to secure the reelection
                                of China to these bodies.</p>
                            <p>This question also arose in 1956 in connection with our decision to
                                make exceptions and to support a Czech for Vice-President of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Conference, as part of a
                                general agreement on the officers of the Conference, and to support
                                Poland for election to <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, in
                                view of changing Polish-Soviet relations.</p>
                            <p>It was raised again in 1957 before the spring session of the Economic
                                and Social Council. While <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> did
                                not consider the international circumstances at that time propitious
                                for any change in policy, it was agreed that this question should be
                                re-examined again before the 12th General Assembly.</p>
                            <p>Our policy of not voting for the USSR or Soviet-bloc candidates has
                                not in most cases, the notable exception being the Security Council,
                                prevented their being elected. Most <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> Members believe that each geographic area in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be represented on its
                                various bodies and that the election of a country does not connote
                                approval or disapproval of its Government or its conduct.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the Security Council, US statements during the recent
                                    <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> debate on enlargement of the
                                Council commit us to accept the allocation of a seat to Eastern
                                Europe if agreement is reached on a suitable enlargement. The US
                                representative said in the debate that with the proposed increase in
                                the number of non-permanent seats, “it would be possible to provide
                                representation to Eastern Europe without denying equitable
                                representation to other geographic areas.” Within this context, he
                                said further that the US “would support an appropriate allocation of
                                all non-permanent seats in an expanded council.” The USSR had made
                                clear that it would not support any increase unless provision were
                                made inter alia for representation of Eastern Europe, which, in
                                informal discussions, it defined as including Yugoslavia but not
                                Greece, Turkey or Finland.</p>
                            <p>While agreement on the allocation of a seat to Eastern Europe would
                                not commit us necessarily to support the Soviet candidate for this
                                seat in an enlarged Council, it would certainly seem to preclude <pb
                                    n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0256"/>our supporting a candidate
                                from outside the area for this seat. We could of course abstain or
                                vote negatively on an unpalatable candidate from the area, but
                                active efforts to defeat this candidacy would not only almost
                                certainly prove futile but would undoubtedly be regarded generally
                                as contrary to the agreement allocating a seat to Eastern Europe,
                                except in the unlikely event of rival candidacies from within the
                                area.</p>
                            <p>Though our practice of abstaining or voting negatively on all
                                Soviet-bloc candidates is generally known within the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, most of the votes concerned are by
                                secret ballot and therefore not likely, where the election of the

                                attract attention or receive widespread publicity. Moreover, many of
                                the posts involved are of such character that there is little public

                            to the resolution we intend to table. Assuming it will not be possible
                            to get final agreement on the text of the resolution with the UK,
                            France, Canada, Japan and several others, a paragraph along the

                                    international loan to enable Israel to pay compensation which is
                                    due and which would enable many of the refugees to find a better

                                    would facilitate the resettlement of refugees. We are still

                                xml:id="d84fn2">A note on the source text indicates that these

                            the paper was approved by the Secretary “as a basis for consultation
                            with the Department of Defense with the objective of arriving at a
                            United States Government position”. No such position has yet been
                            arrived at, and all of the enclosed papers should be regarded as
                            informal working papers for internal use only. Our conversations with
                            Defense will continue, of course, with a view to formulating such a
                            position in order that it may then be submitted to Ambassador <persName

                            Meanwhile, the possible future use of such ideas as may develop out of
                            the conversations with Defense may have been overtaken and altered by
                            the decision already taken by the Secretary General to establish a

                            Permanent <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force. You know, of course,
                            that Dick Pedersen and I were told by <persName corresp="#p_BRJ1">Ralph
                                Bunche</persName> that the Secretary General thinks that the General

                            instead turn its attention to the financing of the existing <gloss

                            <item>U.S. Proposal re Reduction of its U.N. Assessment to 30 per
                                cent</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>We are informed by the Australian and New Zealand Delegations that they
                            will oppose in the Fifth Committee any reduction in the assessment
                            percentage of the United States. This position has been taken despite
                            approaches by our Embassies in Canberra and <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1"
                                >Wellington</persName>. It appears to be based primarily upon
                            financial considerations and to ignore the political aspects of the
                            problem. It fails to take into account the fact that twenty-two new
                            Members have been admitted to the United Nations—an increase of 35 per
                            cent—since the United States contribution was reduced to 33.33 per cent
                            in 1954.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I recommend that you speak to the heads of the Australian
                            and New Zealand Delegations about the seriousness with <pb n="234"
                                xml:id="pg_234" facs="0260"/>which we view our proposal. It would be
                            very damaging to us in the Fifth Committee if these Delegations spoke
                            and voted against us.</p>
                        <p>In essence, our proposal is the following: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That the General Assembly decide, in principle, that the
                                    maximum contribution of any one Member be reduced to 30 per
                                    cent.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That for 1958 the United States contribution be reduced only
                                    to the extent that this is made possible by applying the
                                    contributions of six new Members which have not yet been
                                    incorporated into the scale of assessments. This will permit a
                                    United States reduction of about 2 per cent, and incidentally
                                    will provide a small reduction for New Zealand, although not for
                                    Australia.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The reduction of the United States percentage to 30 per cent
                                    will be completed in the future only when the admission of new
                                    Members or the increase in national income of present Members
                                    make this possible.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The United States proposal will provide specifically that it
                                    will not cause an increase in the percentage contributions of
                                    any other Members.</item>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> called the meeting to
                            order at 9:30 a.m. He commented that while the delegates seemed to be
                            able to arrive on time, the staff was appearing later and later for the
                            meetings. He suggested that everyone come to the meetings on time in the
                            future. He then called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFL1"
                                >Mewshaw</persName> for the day’s announcements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFL1">Mewshaw</persName> said that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> would like to have a
                            meeting of all the area political liaison officers following the
                            Delegation Meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFL1">Mewshaw</persName>
                            then said that general debate will continue through the end of next
                            week, that is until the fifth of October. He suggested that delegates
                            pay special attention to the speech by the Chinese, Dr. Hu Shih, an
                            eminent Chinese scholar and former Ambassador to the United States. Dr.
                            Hu Shih was to be third speaker of the morning in the General
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFL1">Mewshaw</persName> then recalled that the
                            Security Council would meet at 10:30 in the morning in secret session to
                            discuss the renewal <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0261"/>of the
                            appointment of the Secretary-General. During the afternoon session today
                            (September 26) the general debate will continue with speeches by the
                            representatives of Bolivia, El Salvador and Sudan. The General Assembly
                            will then consider the recommendations of the Security Council as to the
                            reelection of the Secretary-General. In the probable event that the
                            Security Council gives its unanimous consent, the General Assembly will
                            probably acclaim the unanimous election of the Secretary-General,
                            following which there would be speeches of congratulations. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MFL1">Mewshaw</persName> then reminded the
                            delegation that the Disarmament Commission begins its work Monday
                            (September 30) and that tomorrow (September 27) the Fifth Committee
                            would begin its meetings.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> then called on Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> to present to the
                            delegation the problem of the Scale of Assessments. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> began by explaining that the
                            problem of the United States’ contribution was important more as a
                            matter of principle than in its actual amount of money. The United
                            States is assessed at 33.33% of the regular budget, and we are proposing
                            a decrease in this percentage to 30%. This question has arisen because
                            of the recent large increase in United Nations membership. We feel that
                            with the admission of the new nations, the percentage of all members,
                            including the United States, should be decreased on a pro rata basis.
                            This principle, of course, would not apply to members paying minimum
                            assessment percentages.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> outlined briefly the
                            background of the problem of payments to the United Nations. Ever since
                            the meetings of the Preparatory Commission in 1945, the United Nations
                            has accepted the principle that assessments should be based broadly upon
                            the capacity to pay. We objected from the very beginning to the
                            applications of this principle to the largest contributor. It was first
                            proposed by the Committee on Contributions that the United States
                            assessment be fixed at 49.89% of the total. After Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_VAH1">Vandenberg</persName> had strongly objected to
                            this large proportion, the initial assessment approved by the General
                            Assembly in 1946 was set at 39.89%. In 1948, an Assembly resolution
                            recognized the principle that in normal times the maximum contribution
                            of one state should not exceed ⅓ of the United Nations expenditures for
                            that year. Despite American efforts to have its percentage reduced,
                            however, our assessment remained at 39.89% until 1950, when certain
                            small deductions were carried out. In 1952, the General Assembly decided
                            that the highest contributor should not pay more than 33⅓% after the
                            first of January, 1954. Since that date, the percentage has remained at
                            33⅓%.</p>
                        <p>In 1955, the General Assembly decided that the scale of investments
                            should remain fixed for three years, that is for 1956, 1957, <pb n="236"
                                xml:id="pg_236" facs="0262"/>and 1958. This meant that the U.S.
                            percentage for each of the years would be 33.33% of the total. This
                            situation was affected however when sixteen new members were admitted
                            later in the 1955 session. The U.S. anticipated that all of the old
                            members would benefit proportionately by the additional contributions of
                            these new members. However, in the spring of 1956, the U.N. Committee on
                            Contributions fixed the percentages for these new members, recommending
                            that they be consolidated into the scale of assessments by reducing the
                            percentage shares of the old members, except for the maximum and minimum
                            contributors—the United States and some seventeen countries which paid
                            less than 8/10 of one percent. Last year we objected in the Assembly
                            very strongly to this formula, but we finally agreed to a decision by
                            which the Contributions Committee recommendations were accepted for the
                            years 1956 and 1957, but with the proviso that the assessment scale for
                            1958 be left open for discussion at this Twelfth General Assembly, and
                            that the assessments of Japan, Tunis, Morocco, and Sudan, who were
                            admitted last year, be maintained outside the regular scale of
                            assessments.</p>
                        <p>Since last year two more new members, Ghana and Malaya, have been
                            admitted. The percentage contributions of the six new members whose
                            assessments have not yet been brought within the regular scale, will
                            come to a total of about 2.11% of the total budget.</p>
                        <p>During the last Assembly, the United States announced publicly that it
                            would press for a reduction in its contribution to 30% of the total, in
                            view of the admission of all the new members, and we are making this
                            proposal this year.</p>
                        <p>There are three parts to the U.S. proposal as it stands now: <list>
                                <label>(a)</label>
                                <item>that, in principle, the maximum contribution for any one state
                                    should be 30%,</item>
                                <label>(b)</label>
                                <item>that the assessment percentages of the six new states be used
                                    to reduce the United States percentage, now by about 2%,
                                    and</item>
                                <label>(c)</label>
                                <item>that in the future the United States contributions should be
                                    reduced to the level of 30%, as new members join the United
                                    Nations and as increases in national income in certain countries
                                    require increases in their assessment percentages.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>One particular appealing element in the United States proposal is that no
                            other country will have to pay more than previously as a result of the
                            adoption of our idea. We believe that this aspect of our proposal gives
                            it a chance of success.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of the other governments involved during the Assembly has
                            been generally unsympathetic to the idea of a reduction in the United
                            States percentage contribution. This stems from many factors, among
                            which is the view that the United States can well afford to pay more
                            than its present percentage. There is a <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237"
                                facs="0263"/>widespread feeling that since the relative capacity to
                            pay of the United States is said to be about 42%, we are now paying less
                            than we should. In addition the annual increases in the total dollar
                            budget at the U.N. have required other governments to increase their
                            dollar contributions each year. We have asked the Department to seek
                            support from Foreign Offices through our overseas posts, but it is not
                            clear from the poll whether or not we have a majority for our proposal.
                            Most governments seem to have been afraid to commit themselves, although
                            many Member States apparently have no objection, providing the reduction
                            in our assessment does not lead to an increase in theirs. There is,
                            however, a widespread belief among Western European and Commonwealth
                            nations that it is presently impossible to increase the burden of
                            expenses borne by the new Asian and African nations, and that,
                            therefore, they, the Western Europeans and Commonwealth, will be
                            squeezed as the U.S. percentage is decreased.</p>
                        <p>Our position is particularly difficult this year, as the expenses to be
                            appropriated for <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss><note n="2"

                            order to keep the force in action through 1958. The Secretary-General
                            favors a direct levy on Member States to pay for <gloss
                                target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss>, but when the states are paying this
                            additional expense, they will not be in a mood to welcome United States
                            suggestions that its regular share be reduced.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CASJ1">Carnahan</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> what criteria were used to
                            determine what countries, in addition to the U.S., would not share in
                            the 6.3% of the total budget to which the first sixteen new members
                            contributed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> answered
                            that any country contributing less than .08% received no reduction. He
                            then pointed out that the sixteen countries already admitted plus the
                            six admitted last year and this year will bring the new contribution
                            percentages up to 9% of the total budget. Three percent of this could
                            equitably go to reduction of the United States assessment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CASJ1">Carnahan</persName> then asked if the
                            33⅓% contribution which we are now paying was a “ceiling” or a “floor”,
                            that is, was it considered to be a maximum or a minimum contribution.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> answered that it is a
                            ceiling by the terms of U.N. resolutions, but that the average U.N.
                            contributor was more likely to treat it as a “floor” or as a minimum
                            U.S. contribution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> then recalled that he
                            had served as the United States Representative on the Fifth Committee
                            during his service as a member of the U.S. Delegation to the Fifth
                            General Assembly. At that time, he had talked to Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_VAH1">Vandenberg</persName> who pointed out the two
                            factors in relation to the problem of contributions. First, Senator <pb
                                n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0264"/><persName corresp="#p_VAH1"
                                >Vandenberg</persName> said that it was wrong to judge the
                            contributions according to the capacity to pay and, second, that paying
                            a large percentage of the contribution would give us, in the eyes of
                            other delegations, too much influence in the U.N.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> mentioned that an
                            American statistician named Appleby had put this country on the spot
                            with a great deal of documentation about the gross national product, the
                            total national income, and a great number of economic facts all of which
                            helped to prove that we could pay up to 50% of the total budget,
                            according to the capacity to pay formula. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VAH1">Vandenberg</persName> had made the comment at the
                            time that with such promising facts on the gross national product and
                            our capacity to pay, the other countries would be certainly forced to
                            follow our free enterprise system. However, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> pointed out that the large
                            percentage has been decreasing and there is definitely no evidence that
                            the 33⅓% contribution, now being used, is a floor. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> added that it should not be
                            denied that we gain a certain influence by picking up ⅓ of the total
                            check.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> pointed out that with
                            the addition of sixteen new members, it would be unfortunate from a
                            public relations viewpoint for us to pay the same contribution, while
                            the others had their percentages reduced, particularly the Soviet Union.
                            He made the comment that he had observed, while he was on the Fifth
                            Committee, that many of the experts were so cognizant of the problems of
                            finance that they lost all sight of political and public relations
                            factors. For this reason Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> said we, the U.S. Delegation, were extremely
                            fortunate to be represented on the Fifth Committee by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CASJ1">Carnahan</persName>, who has a broad background
                            of political training.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CASJ1">Carnahan</persName> asked how the figure
                            of 49.89%, which was once used as our contribution, was arrived at. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName>’s answer was that the
                            formula was to find something less than 50%, and that it was an
                            arbitrary decision. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CASJ1">Carnahan</persName>
                            also asked what the smallest dollar amount came to in the case of
                            nations paying the basic minimum. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1"
                                >Bender</persName> answered that those nations paying the smallest
                            percentage amount (.04%) of the present $50,000,000 budget are only
                            assessed $20,000 a year.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Judd<note n="3" xml:id="d86fn3">Congressman Walter Judd (R-Minn.)
                                member of the Delegation to the Twelfth General Assembly.</note>
                            asked if the U.S. reduction of two percentage points was from 33 to 31%
                            of the total U.N. budget, or 2% of our last dollar contribution. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> answered that it was
                            from 33 to 31% only. Dr. Judd commented that as a Delegate to the World
                            Health Organization, the same problem had arisen, but he felt that he
                            who had the money should in a sense make his influence felt. Dr. Judd
                            also pointed out that other countries have now regained <pb n="239"
                                xml:id="pg_239" facs="0265"/>their prosperity, and that they could
                            indeed step up their contributions.</p>
                        <p>Miss Dunne<note n="4" xml:id="d86fn4">Irene Dunne, motion picture actress
                                and member of the Delegation to the Twelfth Session of the General

                            questions later in private, she would like to know whether or not the
                            33⅓% paid by the U.S. was sufficient to increase our prestige and
                            influence over other countries or could it be, she wondered, that we
                            were being hated more and more. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> answered that our country would probably never be
                            liked but that we can at least hope to be respected. An interesting
                            comment, he pointed out, made originally by Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJO1">Pastore</persName> of Rhode Island when he was on
                            the delegation is that every time you pull out a paper towel in the
                            U.N., each third towel is paid for by the United States.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CASJ1">Carnahan</persName> asked what
                            would happen to our position if Congress decided by itself to reduce the
                            United States share to what it thought should be the correct proportion.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1">Bender</persName> answered that there
                            was very little that anyone could do if Congress so acted, but that our
                            assessment, once voted by the General Assembly, was at least a very
                            strong obligation under the Charter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAF1"
                                >Bender</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLC1"
                                >Meeker</persName>, legal advisor on U.N. affairs, to comment on
                            this problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Meeker</persName> replied
                            that the Charter says that each member must pay its share, according to
                            what has been voted by the General Assembly. If a member does not pay
                            its full share, the arrears build up to the point where a country in
                            arrears more than the equivalent of its contribution for a two-year
                            period, loses its right to vote. In our case, a reduction by Congress of
                            the United States percentage of 33 to 31% would not be felt in this
                            respect for about twenty years. The most significant and most
                            distressing part would be, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLC1"
                                >Meeker</persName>, that we would be in default of our treaty
                            obligations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Wells<note n="5" xml:id="d86fn5">Herman Wells, President of Indiana

                            assessments were made in dollar currency. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that while all of the
                            payments were not actually in dollars, they had to be 100% convertible
                            currency. He explained that the assessment for <gloss target="#t_UNEF1"
                                >UNEF</gloss> was not yet clear on this point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> summarized the
                            discussion by explaining that, although Congressman <persName
                                corresp="#p_CASJ1">Carnahan</persName> was carrying the major
                            responsibility on the assessments question, many of the staff members
                            might be asked about it, and that it was wise for everyone to understand
                            the problem. Dr. Wells asked, finally, whether the Chinese proportion
                                <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0266"/>was based on the population
                            area and capacity to pay of the mainland or only of that of Formosa. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied that it was
                            based on the mainland situation, and that because of this, the Chinese
                            paid a large amount of money every year and kept one of the largest
                            staffs of any delegation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> closed the meeting at

                            General Assembly placed upon you an unprecedented task this past year in

                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In past two days Soviet delegation in
                            Fifth Committee has taken attitude re U.S. contribution to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which differs markedly from past.</p>
                        <p>On afternoon, October 1, Soviets and Czechs were on list of speakers
                            discussing U.S. proposal for reduction U.S. assessment to 30 per cent.
                            Czechs made statement along lines of previous years, strongly attacking
                            U.S. proposal. Soviets, however, withdrew from speakers list and
                            requested meeting with <gloss target="#t_USDel1">USDel</gloss> to
                            discuss matter.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ZZGN1">Zarubin</persName> and
                            his staff met with <persName corresp="#p_CASJ1">Carnahan</persName> and
                            advisers. <persName corresp="#p_ZZGN1">Zarubin</persName> stated Soviet
                            Delegation wished cooperate fully with U.S. on scale-of-assessments
                            question and hoped would be possible find solution which would be
                            satisfactory both governments. Then he stated Soviets prepared support
                            reduction, in principle, of U.S. percentage contribution to 38 [30] per
                            cent. However, Soviets wished be certain that method whereby that
                            reduction implemented would not create pressure for increase Soviet
                            contribution. After hour’s discussion of subject, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZZGN1">Zarubin</persName> said Soviets would consider
                            matter in their delegation meeting today and would discuss further with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CASJ1">Carnahan</persName> 3:00 p.m. today. In
                            concluding remarks, <persName corresp="#p_ZZGN1">Zarubin</persName>
                            reiterated desire cooperate with U.S. in every way possible. May be
                            significant that change in Soviet attitude apparently occurred just
                            after arrangements made for Gromyko’s meeting with Secretary.</p>

                            demonstrations were “not peaceful”, as Soviet Foreign Ministry had
                            already three times reminded Embassy, and these demonstrations
                            interfered with normal functioning and work of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Mission. <persName corresp="#p_DRH1">Davis</persName>
                            then asked for specific instances of improper or disorderly acts which

                            demonstrations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DRH1">Davis</persName> then inquired whether Soviet
                            government was insisting that all peaceful picketing be forbidden by US
                            authorities. <persName corresp="#p_KAG1">Kulazhenkov</persName> then
                            stated he considered information concerning measures taken by police
                            authorities as “intention” of US authorities to insure normal conditions
                            for work of Soviet <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mission and he

                        <p>The Fifth Committee of the United Nations General Assembly took up the
                            question of the scale of financial assessments and contributions for the
                            apportionment of United Nations expenses early in October 1957. The
                            majority of members on the Fifth Committee accepted the United States
                            proposal for a reduction in United States contributions on the
                            understanding that such a reduction would be progressively achieved and
                            would be contingent upon the admission of still other members to the
                            United Nations or on the increase in national income of current members.
                            The United States proposal, as amended in the course of the discussion,
                            was adopted by the Fifth Committee by a vote of 43 to 17 with 17
                            abstentions, <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0271"/>and later at a
                            plenary meeting of the General Assembly on October 14, by a vote of 39
                            to 16 with 13 abstentions. According to draft Minutes of the Ninth
                            Meeting of the Delegation to the General Assembly held at Mission
                            Headquarters on the morning of October 10, <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> began by congratulating Representative <persName
                                corresp="#p_CASJ1">Carnahan</persName> and his associates on the
                            United States Delegation to the Fifth Committee “for succeeding in
                            having lowered the rate of assessments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> said that last year no headway had been made but
                            that this year in the Fifth Committee the vote was 43-17 in favor of
                            lowering our contribution to 30%.” <persName corresp="#p_CASJ1"
                                >Carnahan</persName> replied “that it had been an interesting
                            procedure checking with the Russians as to how they would vote on the
                            question. The Russians had agreed to deliver their vote ‘en bloc’ but
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CASJ1">Carnahan</persName> said that we also
                            had to give a great deal of attention to the votes of the smaller
                            countries.” (<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> Files,
                            US/A/M(SR)/66–US/A/M(SR)/132)</p>
                        <p>As a result of the decision in principle to reduce the assessment of the
                            largest contributor to no more than 30 percent over an unspecified
                            number of years, the Committee on Contributions determined to reduce the
                            United States assessment for 1958 to 32.51 percent. The scale of
                            assessment submitted by this Committee to the Fifth Committee was
                            approved unanimously on December 14, by both the Fifth Committee and,
                            subsequently, the General Assembly.</p>

                        <p>You may remember that I submitted such a scheme to you— involving no

                            foreign policy (although our control would not be apparent); getting us

                        <p>Ever since I have been here US policy has been negative. This has hurt

                            take at this General Assembly. It still has to be cleared by Treasury,
                            Budget, and the White House staff. There really is no sound argument
                            against it and overwhelming arguments in favor of it. It aims directly
                            at all those countries which are most upset by what happened at Little

                        <p>Concerning first-step concept we would visualize need for permanent

                            above. This staff could also devise and/or outline necessary legal
                            agreements and other understandings needed facilitate implementation of

                            deployed must be retained. It would also seem that contributions of
                            contingents to make up force should be planned from nations other than
                            permanent members of Security Council. Neither do we favor continuation

                                <item><p>There is a great need at this time that the free nations
                                        should take some further significant and dramatic step to
                                        advance the society of free nations along the path of law
                                        and order. This is necessary for several reasons.</p>
                                    <p>One reason is the fact that the present system is inadequate.
                                        It will deteriorate and may fall apart unless it is
                                        strengthened.</p>
                                    <p>Another reason is the fact that nuclear power, which now
                                        approaches the power of annihilation, should not be the
                                        weapons tool of individual nations but should be made to
                                        serve the interests of world order by becoming an impartial
                                        and effective deterrent to the international crime of armed
                                        aggression. It seems unlikely that this result can be
                                        achieved on a universal basis with the Soviet Union. But
                                        that makes it the more important that the free nations
                                        should set themselves to the task.</p>

                                    <p>Finally, it is always incumbent upon the leadership of the
                                        free world to demonstrate a capacity to think and act
                                        creatively. We cannot safely stand still, with so much that
                                        needs doing. Positive action is necessary in order to
                                        counter the dynamic approach of Communism which seeks to
                                        build a world-wide international order of its own
                                        fashion.</p>

                                <item>Any new step should meet the crying need for (a) a more
                                    developed body of international law; (b) more solid and
                                    dependable processes for peaceful settlement of disputes; (c) a
                                    more effective and dependable system of international force to
                                    deter, and if need be resist, those who would violate agreed
                                    principles of law, and (d) the organization and control of
                                    armament, particularly nuclear weapons.</item>

                                <item><p>It was expected that some of the developments referred to
                                        in No. 2 above would be accomplished through the United
                                        Nations. The Charter prescribes certain basic principles of
                                        international conduct (Article 2) and contemplates a further
                                        codification of international law. It calls for the
                                        establishment of air, land and sea military contingents and
                                        facilities for the use of the Security Council in
                                        maintaining international peace and security (Articles 43
                                        and 45). It establishes procedures for the peaceful
                                        settlement of international disputes and created the
                                        International Court of Justice as the body to which legal
                                        disputes should normally be referred.</p>
                                    <p>However, these Charter provisions have fallen short of
                                        practice of producing the desired result. This has been
                                        largely due to the abuse by the Soviet Union of the veto
                                        power and its influence in the organization in favor of
                                        stirring up disputes, not settling them. The collective
                                        security system contemplated by the Charter has never even
                                        begun to be established. Also it seems that the Soviet Union
                                        will block any effective control on a universal basis of
                                        nuclear, or other, weapons.</p>

                                        problem of the willingness of the present parties to mutual
                                        security arrangements to enter into a new arrangement. There
                                        would be the problem of relations with the United Nations.
                                        There would be the attitude of the Sino-Soviet bloc and of
                                        “neutrals”. There would be the question of fitting some, at
                                        least, of United States military power into a tighter
                                        international framework. There would be domestic political
                                        considerations. There may be lacking the sense of danger and
                                        urgency which is usually required to accomplish major
                                        political goals, although the state of the United Nations
                                        disarmament talks makes apparent the need for a constructive

                                pacts supplementary to the Charter of the United Nations. These

                                    <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> (Brussels), Baghdad, <gloss

                                United Nations, who cannot fairly be said to be located in any
                                single “region” unless all of the world outside the Sino-Soviet
                                orbit be regarded as such a “region”.</p>

                            <p>In Article 52, paragraph 1, of the United Nations Charter, it is
                                provided in pertinent part: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Nothing in the present Charter precludes the existence of
                                        regional arrangements or agencies <hi rend="italic">for

                                </quote></p>
                            <p>It could well be argued that the setting up of an arrangement or
                                agency for dealing with the maintenance of international peace and
                                security which has as participants a majority of the members of the
                                United Nations, who, in turn, have territories located on every
                                continent and bordering on every ocean, is not the creation of a
                                regional organization within the meaning of Article 52, paragraph 1.
                                Because of the express limitation on the activities of such regional
                                organizations contained in Article 52, paragraph 1, a convincing
                                argument could be made that an organization having a broader
                                geographical function is impliedly prohibited by the United Nations
                                Charter, since such an organization must of necessity be in the
                                nature of a rival or rump United Nations. In my view, these
                                objections are serious and an attempt to go forward with such a
                                project despite them could be widely interpreted, even by nations
                                friendly to us, as reflecting a United States determination that the
                                United Nations should be replaced by a free world United Nations,
                                leaving out the Soviet bloc nations and the so-called
                                “neutrals.”</p>
                            <p>There are, however, certain alternatives through which a substantial
                                part, if not all, of the desired objectives could be accomplished
                                without exposing us to such a charge. Perhaps the best of the
                                regional collective security arrangements now in existence is the
                                OAS. The Charter of the OAS contains provisions which closely
                                approximate the requirements laid down in your draft #5, save for
                                disarmament provisions and a collective security force in being. If
                                the Brussels (<gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>) pact be read with
                                NATO, the European collective security arrangements, as they
                                presently exist, could be said to include both disarmament and
                                collective security force provisions. Nothing comparable is to be
                                found in existing collective security pacts in the Middle East and
                                in the Pacific area.</p>
                            <p>As a point of departure, I would suggest, first, an attempt to
                                consolidate our collective security pacts with the free world
                                nations in and about the Pacific area into a single treaty. As far
                                as existing provisions are concerned, this could be done with a
                                minimum of revisions because of the almost identical language used
                                in most of these treaties. In view of the necessity of
                                renegotiation, however, thought should be given to the question of
                                whether it would be advisable to suggest a regional arrangement
                                comparable to the Charter of the OAS. Whichever is determined upon,
                                the new Pacific <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0279"/>Treaty
                                would contain, in addition to provisions of the types suggested in
                                your draft #5, a provision or provisions calling for the Council or
                                other Organ established by the Treaty to maintain liaison and
                                consultative relations with the corresponding Organs of the other
                                regional collective security organizations, such as OAS and NATO
                                (cf. Article 6 of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance
                                which would have to be expanded and strengthened). These provisions
                                could be drafted in such a manner as to indicate that one possible
                                result of such consultation could be joint or mutual action by two
                                or more of the regional organizations.</p>
                            <p>Such relationships would not appear to be inconsistent with the
                                provisions of Article 52, paragraph 1, of the United Nations
                                Charter, since it is a legitimate function of a regional collective
                                security organization to keep itself informed and, if necessary, to
                                take action with respect to aggression or other activities in other
                                regions which may by chain reaction affect regional peace or
                                security.</p>
                            <p>Simultaneously, or immediately thereafter, steps could be initiated
                                to amend the Charter of the OAS and the NATO Treaty, as required, to
                                make their provisions conform in substance with the new Pacific
                                States Collective Security Pact.</p>
                            <p>The last gap to be closed would be the Middle East and Africa. In
                                that connection, the optimum objective would be to negotiate a
                                collective security arrangement containing provisions comparable to
                                those contained in the pacts covering the other regional
                                arrangements, while, at the same time, negotiating a political
                                settlement or modus vivendi between the Israelis and the Arabs.</p>

                                target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> to raise three basic questions: 1) Does
                            the answer to our present problems lie in the creation of additional
                            machinery? 2) Are nations generally willing to make advance commitments
                            with respect to the use of force outside areas of direct interest to
                            themselves? 3) Is it possible to extend the OAS system to other, not
                            comparable regions?</p>
                        <p>In addition, it is our understanding that a principal purpose of a new
                            proposal in this general field would be the psychological benefits to be
                            derived from the standpoint of U.S. leadership of the free world.
                                Here,<gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> heartily concurs in your
                            conclusion that any U.S. effort to establish a new collective security
                            system embracing all of the free world but excluding the Communist bloc
                            would almost certainly be interpreted as U.S. abandonment of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Furthermore, any such pact would appear,
                            if only by reason of the exclusion of the Communist countries from it,
                            to be directed primarily toward the Communist threat. It might well
                            therefore produce an adverse reaction on the grounds that it
                            overemphasizes the military as against the political and economic
                            approach to current problems <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0281"
                            />and that it would tend to increase rather than decrease tension
                            between the free world and the USSR.</p>
                        <p>One of the principal considerations underlying the reduced enthusiasm for
                            a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter review conference is, in
                                <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>’s opinion, the rather widely held
                            view that the policies of member governments rather than <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mechanisms are responsible for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s shortcomings. An example frequently
                            cited is the reluctance of countries to accept the compulsory
                            jurisdiction of the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>, and their
                            reluctance to have recourse to the Court even where such recourse is
                            clearly the appropriate means of peaceful settlement. Only this last
                            year, you will recall, the British extended their reservations in
                            accepting the Court’s jurisdiction to include disputes “relating to any
                            question which in the opinion of the Government of the United Kingdom
                            affects the national security of the United Kingdom or any of its
                            dependent territories.” While this situation is widely deplored in
                            principle, it is not thought that the present international atmosphere
                            is conducive to that change in the attitudes of governments that would
                            be required to remedy it.</p>
                        <p>Similarily, all member states are committed under the Charter to settle
                            their disputes by peaceful means and a wide variety of procedures is
                            available to encourage and assist such settlement. Actual settlement,
                            however, depends, as you know, on the parties’ willingness to reach
                            agreement on or to accept a recommended settlement. That member states
                            would be willing now to go further and agree in advance to accept an
                            undefined settlement seems improbable when viewed in the context of the
                            dispute between Israel and the Arab states, for example, or between
                            India and Pakistan over Kashmir. Again, therefore, progress in peaceful
                            settlement does not appear to depend on the creation of additional
                            mechanisms but on the attitudes of governments.</p>
                        <p>While the Soviet veto in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> has made
                            it impossible for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to enforce
                            decisions, it is questionable how far the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> should or could go, irrespective of the veto, in
                            enforcing decisions under present world conditions. Collective military
                            action going beyond the <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> type
                            operations does not appear practical. Such action to be effective would
                            require the participation of one or more of the major powers. Inclusion
                            of the USSR in such action would obviously not be to the free world
                            interest under present circumstances. Action by the other major powers
                            without the USSR would almost certainly bring the USSR into the
                            situation and, where the colonial issue is involved, would be suspect in
                            the area of the dispute.</p>
                        <p>Nor does the Soviet veto account for the very poor response of states to
                            the request of the Collective Measures Committee that national
                            contingents be earmarked for possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            use. The replies of member states to this request made it clear that
                            while they <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0282"/>generally, though
                            not without exception, approve the principle of collective security,
                            they are unwilling to make any advance commitments that might involve
                            them in hostilities of unpredictable origin, location, character, and
                            scope.</p>
                        <p>Many states have been willing to make limited commitments with respect to
                            collective action in areas where they see their own security to be
                            directly at stake. They have, however, been unwilling to risk
                            involvement in a great-power struggle in other areas, and there is, in
                            this Bureau’s opinion, no reason to believe that this reluctance would
                            be any less under an Article 51 pact than under procedures and
                            mechanisms provided in the Uniting for Peace resolution. In the absence
                            of any general willingness to make firm commitments of a relatively
                            substantial nature under such a pact, it is difficult to see where its
                            advantage would lie over our present system of regional and bilateral
                            security arrangements. A reaffirmation of principles would not be
                            sufficient to permit the advance planning of the free world’s defense.
                            Moreover, since a free-world Article 51 pact would be regarded as
                            directed against the Soviet bloc primarily, it would certainly not
                            obtain the adherence of more countries than those encompassed in our
                            present system of regional and bilateral security arrangements, and
                            might well result in weakening these arrangements by causing present
                            participants to withdraw when confronted by the need to extend their
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>The interlocking membership of our various regional and bilateral
                            security arrangements and the availability of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> appear to meet the need for consultative machinery and
                            procedures between and among these arrangements so far as it can be met
                            without extending, at least, by implication, the commitments of the
                            participants. Efforts to coordinate more formally NATO with the Baghdad
                            Pact and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> would be likely to
                            intensify anti-colonialism and neutralism in the two latter areas.
                            Moreover, any minimal advantages that might possibly be realized from
                            greater coordination of our various regional and bilateral security
                            arrangements would be offset, in <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>’s
                            opinion, by the implications of such a development with respect to the
                            US attitude toward the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and with
                            respect to East-West tensions.</p>
                        <p>It seems to <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> unrealistic to anticipate
                            the early development elsewhere of regional organizations comparable to
                            the OAS, with the possible exception of the NATO area. The OAS is unique
                            in that 1) it covers a well-defined area having certain generally
                            recognized mutual interests, 2) it includes all states within this area,
                            3) it is of indigenous origins, 4) it is concerned as much, if not more,
                            with developments within the region as with any external threats, and 5)
                            its institutions are the result of an evolutionary process during which
                            they have gained widespread acceptance.</p>
                        <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0283"/>
                        <p>On the other hand, NATO, the Baghdad Pact, and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> are concerned primarily with defense of their
                            respective areas against Soviet aggression, overt or covert. None of
                            them includes all the states in the areas concerned. The impetus behind
                            the Baghdad Pact and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> comes in
                            large measure from outside the area. It is difficult to conceive of
                            their developing along the broader lines of the OAS within the
                            foreseeable future. In these areas intra-regional antagonisms are sharp
                            and neutralism widely prevalent. In the Middle East, solution of the
                            Palestine problem, at least, appears a prerequisite to the establishment
                            of any overall regional organization and in the Far East, solution of
                            the Chinese representation question. In the absence of such solutions,
                            there appears to be no possibility that states outside the present
                            regional security pacts would be willing to join. Many of these states
                            would therefore continue to regard the existing pacts as an indirect
                            threat, thus precluding their serving any useful purpose with respect to
                            intra-regional problems.</p>

                        <p>1033. Following is translation text aide-mémoire handed me by Deputy
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> December 4:</p>
                        <p>“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the USSR has already several times
                            drawn the attention of the Embassy of the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                                >USA</gloss> in Moscow to the wholly inadmissible situation which
                            has been created around the mission of the USSR to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in New York as a result of the
                            hooligan-like actions with regard to the mission and its staff of
                            elements hostile to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>“In this connection the Ministry has pointed out that the failure of the
                            American authorities to adopt effective measures to create normal
                            conditions for the work of the mission can lead to undesirable
                            consequences for the Embassy of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>
                            in so far as the publication in the Soviet press of reports about
                            hostile actions in New York against the mission of the USSR to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, which has not happened up to this
                            time, may cause the rightful indignation of the Soviet public and a
                            corresponding attitude of the pubic of Moscow toward the Embassy of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0284"/>
                        <p>“Notwithstanding the assurances of the Embassy that the American
                            authorities will adopt all necessary measures to prevent acts disturbing
                            order (poryadka) and of lawlessness with regard to the Mission of the
                            USSR at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, hostile demonstrations at
                            the building of the mission are continuing.</p>
                        <p>“On October 23, the building of the Mission was twice subjected to
                            picketing during which participants in the picketing committed
                            hooligan-like pranks (vykhodki) in relation to the staff of the
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>“On November 7 a noisy demonstration hostile toward the Soviet Union,
                            lasting three hours, was again carried out at the building of the
                            mission. The hooligans assembled at the building of the mission crudely
                            insulted the guests who came to the reception at the mission and
                            screamed obscene curses at them. The participants of the mob tried to
                            beat up a member of the mission Barulin.<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2"
                                >Alexandr Barulin.</note> Stones, bottles with paint, and other
                            objects were thrown at the windows and walls of the building of the
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>“In drawing the attention of the Embassy to the inadmissibility of such a
                            situation which is evidence of the clear violation of the diplomatic
                            immunity of the Mission of the USSR in New York with the connivance
                            (popustitelstvo) of the authorities of the <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                                >USA</gloss>, the Government of the USSR expects that the Government

                            measures for not permitting hostile demonstrations in the future at the

                                >UN</gloss> so as to guarantee normal conditions for the work of the

                                <p>The Government of the US is not aware of any actual interference
                                    suffered by the Mission of the USSR to the <gloss

                                    York. Both US and appropriate local authorities in New York
                                    City, have at all times sought to insure that all possible steps
                                    are taken to prevent molestation of the personnel and premises
                                    of the Mission of the USSR to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                        >UN</gloss> in New York City. The Government of the US is
                                    confident that the police authorities of the City of New York
                                    will continue to observe this practice. If the efforts of the
                                    authorities have not entirely prevented annoyance, this is
                                    regretted. The Government of the US can reaffirm, however, that
                                    violation of laws protecting the mission from molestation will
                                    make the offenders subject to appropriate legal action.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the US deems it necessary to point out to the
                                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the USSR that it will not and
                                    cannot curtail certain inalienable rights granted to all
                                    residents of the US, including freedom of speech and the right

                            information from New York City Police on November 7 picketing:</p>
                        <p>During picketing demonstrators were not permitted to picket in front of
                            building occupied by USSR Mission on side of the street on which
                            building is located. New York City Police authorities assigned 95
                            policemen to area including 5 mounted patrolmen. When some of
                            demonstrators became disorderly 5 persons were arrested and subsequently
                            court convictions were obtained in all 5 cases. Moreover local
                            authorities are prepared to take appropriate steps in every occasion
                            when complaints are filed by an aggrieved party. On number occasions
                            alleged Soviet victims have refused to file a <pb n="262"

                            complaint, charges could not be brought.</p>

                            Washington, D.C. concerns picketing of foreign embassies, legations,
                            etc. There is no law prohibiting picketing of White House and picketing
                            frequently occurs. A measure of control is exercised to make sure that
                            pickets do not litter area with discarded leaflets and placards, and a
                            permit is required if picketing group intends chant or sing.</p>

                                consider the possibility of invoking the provisions of Article 28(2)
                                of the Charter which provides for periodic meetings of the Council.
                                Furthermore, the Good Offices Committee consisting of
                                representatives of Egypt, the Netherlands, and Peru, which was
                                established by the 8th session, was continued; and both this
                                Committee and the Security Council were requested to report to the
                                10th Assembly. This means that at some time shortly, probably this
                                summer, the Security Council will have to consider the membership
                                question. Unless there has been some basic change in the position of
                                the respective members, however, it may be that Council
                                consideration can be limited to confirming the fact that positions
                                have not changed, making it unnecessary to vote on the pending
                                applications once again.</item>

                            <item>In initiating negotiations for a peace treaty with the USSR, Japan
                                has indicated its intention to try to get from the USSR a commitment
                                to support its admission into the United Nations as a <pb n="265"
                                    xml:id="pg_265" facs="0291"/>part of the overall negotiations.
                                So far the USSR has never included Japan in its “package”. Last year
                                Japanese sources were inclined to believe that Japan had no chance
                                for admission unless a solution of the Chinese representation issue
                                was reached simultaneously. In the current negotiations, however,
                                there have been no indications whether Japan would seek an outright
                                unqualified commitment from the USSR or would be willing to accept a
                                “deal” of some sort that would tie Japan’s admission to the
                                admission of certain other outstanding candidates. It seems likely
                                that Japan will insist upon an unqualified commitment, if it
                                seriously desires admission into the United Nations. Whether the
                                USSR would make such a commitment depends upon the importance it now
                                attaches to regularizing its relations with Japan in the context of
                                the present Far Eastern situation and on its position generally
                                regarding membership. It is possible, however, that Japan might
                                simply accept inclusion in the Soviet “package”, if it can obtain
                                other substantial concessions in return, in which case there would
                                be increasing pressure upon the United States to relax its position
                                on a “package” arrangement.</item>

                            <item>The issue of Chinese representation has an important bearing on
                                the membership question. It is possible that the USSR will not
                                modify its present position on membership until this issue has been
                                resolved in some way. Furthermore, any relaxation of the present
                                position of the United States with respect to the Soviet sponsored
                                candidates could have undesirable repercussions so far as the
                                Chinese representation question is concerned. Accordingly, it may be
                                that this issue precludes any progress toward a solution of the
                                membership impasse, with the possible exception of an agreement to
                                admit several of the “non-committed” states, which in itself seems
                                unlikely.</item>

                                    <item>Last year the Secretary General suggested the possibility
                                        of reaching agreement on several states not clearly aligned
                                        with either East or West. Corridor rumors in New York
                                        mentioned such states as Austria, Finland, Libya, and Jordan
                                        in this connection. No actual proposals along this line were
                                        considered, however, apparently because informal soundings
                                        in the Soviet Delegation disclosed that the USSR would not
                                        go along on such a limited arrangement. It might
                                        nevertheless be worthwhile to try this tack again if we feel
                                        we could afford to add three or four such states at the
                                        expense of strong supporters of the West, who have equal if
                                        not better claims to prompt admission. If it were decided to
                                        proceed along these lines, the matter could be informally
                                        discussed with one or more members of the Good Offices
                                        Committee with a view to its developing some such

                                        as a consequence of Charter review. At the least we could
                                        work toward a recommendation by the 10th Assembly that
                                        Members review their position on membership in light of the

                        <p>But on this crucial change, there is the determined (although so far
                            silent) opposition of the British… .</p>

                        <p>Of course we have a deep conviction the other way and I think we should
                            back up our conviction and make a two-fisted effort to get the Charter

                        <p>But in the light of the Secretary General’s view that it might be
                            desirable to postpone a Charter review conference, I thought you should
                            have this British attitude in mind.</p>
                        <p>As it is, without a positive Charter review item, the next General

                        <p>I wish we could get British acquiescence—however grudging—in making a
                            strong effort on non-member participation. It would be good for the
                            U.N., good for the U.S., not really bad for the <gloss target="#t_UK1"

                        <p>Whatever is done either on eliminating the veto on membership by a
                            revision of the Charter or on pressing forward with our proposal for
                            non-member participation, it is clear from past experience that we
                            should begin now to press for acceptance by the British and others. We
                            should not wait until late August, which is always too late on anything
                            controversial. I feel that with more and earlier effort we have a good
                            chance to make progress on both of these questions.</p>

                            <p>Under a resolution adopted by the last General Assembly, the Security
                                Council and a Good Offices Committee (Egypt, Netherlands, Peru) will
                                review the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership situation
                                before the next Assembly meets. (Pending applications, the
                                composition of the Soviet “package”, applicants blocked by the
                                Soviet veto, and other states eligible for membership but which have
                                not applied are listed in <gloss target="#t_TAB1">Tab</gloss> A.)
                                The following possibilities arise as alternatives to the present
                                deadlock: <list>

                                    <item><p>A political “deal” to admit all the applicants.</p>
                                        <p>Since 1946 we have opposed such a deal on the ground that
                                            the Soviet satellites do not meet the qualifications of
                                            Charter Article 4. However, the increasing difficulty of
                                            maintaining support for our position may make it
                                            desirable to review this situation. Until now one of the
                                            strongest arguments against the Soviet package has been
                                            Japan’s omission. In the pending negotiations with the
                                            USSR Japan may obtain Soviet support for its admission,
                                            but if the USSR agrees only to add Japan to its package,
                                            our position will become more difficult since the
                                            package would then include all applicants except
                                            Cambodia, Laos, Viet-Nam and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                                >ROK</gloss> (against whose immediate admission some
                                            plausible arguments may be presented.) Moreover, the
                                            widely held view that the membership problem should be
                                            dealt with in Charter review, enables us to consider the
                                            matter in a new context.</p>
                                        <p>Conceivably the US could publicly indicate willingness to
                                            see all the countries in the Soviet package except the
                                            “Mongolian People’s <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269"
                                                facs="0295"/>Republic” admitted (i.e., Albania,
                                            Austria, Bulgaria, Ceylon, Finland, Hungary, Ireland,
                                            Italy, Jordan, Libya, Nepal, Portugal, Rumania), if
                                            Japan, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, Laos,
                                            Cambodia and Viet-Nam were simultaneously admitted.
                                            Alternatively, we could indicate our readiness to
                                            accept, in addition to the above, Spain and Germany,
                                            even though they have not yet applied. In making any
                                            such proposals, it would be essential to make clear our
                                            continued opposition to the seating of Communist China
                                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Even if, as is
                                            likely, the USSR opposes such proposals, we would then
                                            be in a stronger tactical position to urge alternative
                                            courses, such as non-member participation.</p>

                                        <p>The Secretary General suggested this idea last fall but
                                            dropped it when it became clear the USSR was opposed.
                                            The fact that such a proposal omits states with equal if
                                            not better claims to prompt admission (e.g., Italy,

                                            advisable to keep an open mind on the matter in order to

                                        <p>If we estimate that no progress on membership can now be
                                            made, our most fruitful course of action might be to
                                            reactivate study of non-member participation,
                                            recognizing at the outset that a request for an advisory
                                            opinion from the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>
                                            with respect to the legality of the plan is probably all
                                            we can get through the Assembly at this stage. We could
                                            proceed through diplomatic channels and conceivably also
                                            use the Interim Committee, thus paving the way for the
                                            Tenth <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. On the other

                                            Japan, the most important applicant favorably inclined,
                                            may not maintain its support for this plan. Also to be
                                            considered is the implication that, by promoting
                                            non-member participation, we are relaxing our pressure
                                            for the admission of qualified states.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>David</persName></hi>: I have read
                            your memorandum concerning the Membership Problem,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d105fn2">See the enclosure, <ref target="#d104"><hi
                                        rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note> and this morning
                            talked with the Secretary on this subject. The Secretary agrees that we
                            should make a renewed effort for non-member participation and that we
                            should begin now to obtain support for the passage of a non-member
                            participation resolution at the Tenth General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>As I indicated in my letter to the Secretary on March 31, 1955, I think
                            that in addition to moving ahead on non-member participation, we should
                            also begin now to obtain support for action in the Tenth General
                            Assembly favoring charter revision to eliminate the veto as it applies
                            to membership.</p>
                        <p>I think we can increase support for non-member participation by holding
                            out to non-members the more far-reaching results of charter revision.
                            Therefore, the two aspects of the problem should be considered
                            simultaneously. But I do not think that action on charter revision
                            should delay our getting to work on non-member participation.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> telephoned this
                            morning, April 15th, to caution me concerning the Non-Member
                            Participation Plan as it affects Italy. He said he did not think the
                            Italians would accept such a plan but would insist on full
                            membership.</p>
                        <p>I said that it was not my intention to ask the Italians about the
                            Non-Membership Plan, but to go ahead and push it at the General Assembly
                            in the fall in the knowledge that the Japanese would accept it and that
                            it would be available to all other nations to accept which wanted
                            to.</p>
                        <p>I agreed with the Secretary that we should not assume that the Italians
                            would accept it, but that it was certainly true that they could accept
                            it without in any way prejudicing their chance for full membership.</p>
                        <p>He said it was important always to make that clear because the Italians
                            felt that they had an understanding with the Russians under the terms of
                            which they felt the Russians were obligated to support their
                            membership.</p>
                        <p>I said I did not intend to mention this subject in my testimony before
                            the Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, but that I did intend to
                            go ahead with the Non-Membership Participation scheme in the fall, to
                            which he agreed.</p>

                            Good Offices Committee on membership, called at his request this
                            afternoon with his colleagues from Netherlands and Egypt. He pointed out
                            that under the terms of the last <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            resolution, the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> is seized with the
                            question and that in his dual capacity as chairman of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> and representative of Peru in <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> he feels he is required to raise the
                            matter in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> before the meeting of
                            the 10th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. He said he would do so in a
                            friendly manner and in accordance with our views as to timing and
                            method.</p>
                        <p>He suggests a procedure of taking up each nation in the chronological
                            order in which it has applied for membership, which he considered “less
                            artificial” than taking them up in alphabetical order. Should it appear
                            probable a veto was forthcoming, the question of admission for that
                            particular country could be dropped and the admission of the next
                            country taken up. This would require a certain amount of negotiation
                            prior to discussion on each country.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that this whole question must be considered in the light
                            of the admission of Austria, which is no. 8 on the chronological list.
                            No. 7 is Italy and in this connection <persName corresp="#p_BVA1"
                                >Belaunde</persName> feels it would be very difficult in present
                            circumstances for the USSR to veto Italy. If they did, President of
                            Italy would have good reason repudiate Communist support which helped
                            elect him.</p>
                        <p>It may be possible to make an announcement at the San Francisco meetings

                                <p>Telegram 800 from New York, May 19, reported that the Italian
                                    observer to the United Nations called on <persName

                                    that a very bad impression would be created in Italy if Austria
                                    were admitted to U.N. membership and Italy were not. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> added: “I feel that in
                                    any future action concerning Austrian membership, we should bear
                                    in mind its effect on others. There would be a setback to
                                    communism in Italy if the Soviets vetoed Italian admission after
                                    approving that of Austria. But it must not look as though things
                                    were ‘rigged’ to bring this about.” (Department of State,

                                might appropriately initiate <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                action, at as early a date as possible, particularly in view of its

                                On the other hand <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> and NEA continue
                                to believe we should proceed on this basis as soon as

                            <item>In <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>’s view the timing of any move
                                on membership is of importance for a number of reasons. To proceed
                                only with the seven Asian-African applicants might prejudice broader
                                negotiations, including the possibility of a “package deal” on
                                membership in Great Power negotiations, particularly because any
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action on membership may lead
                                to reconsideration of all pending applications. Also relevant are
                                the facts that (a) all the pending applications (list attached as
                                    <gloss target="#t_TAB1">Tab</gloss> A) are to be reviewed by the

                                    target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>; (b) in the event of a continued
                                membership impasse we would presumably proceed, despite serious
                                obstacles, with our non-member participation plan, on which
                                negotiations ought to be initiated shortly; and (c) support is
                                developing for a Charter amendment to eliminate the veto on
                                membership, of which we may wish to take advantage, should it become
                                clear no possibility exists for positive action on membership; this,
                                however, is not a factor in 1955.</item>

                                    in admitting seven non-Communist states; alternatively, it would
                                    produce an unpopular Soviet veto.</item>

                        <p>I am unable to concur in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KDMK1"
                            >Key</persName>’s memorandum of June 7 which, as I understand it,
                            recommends that we prepare to consider a blanket deal on United Nations
                            membership in the Four-Power negotiations and that we take no initiative
                            for the time being toward implementing the Bandung proposal on
                            membership.</p>
                        <p>The question of blanket deal negotiations with the USSR on membership
                            must be weighed in connection with the Chinese representation problem.
                            The issues of United Nations membership and Chinese representation,
                            while technically separable, are in fact closely related, as you pointed
                            out in a press conference last year (July 8, 1954). Pressures to seat
                            the Chinese Communists have been increasing, especially since the
                            Bandung Conference. Our willingness to accept the Soviet satellites will
                            afford a pretext for other United Nations members to change their
                            positions on Chinese representation, with probable serious consequences
                            for our position at the next General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The close linkage which is known to exist in Communist minds between
                            membership and Chinese representation is currently evidenced by the
                            Soviet-Yugoslav Declaration of June 2.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">For
                                text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents</hi> (R.I.I.A.) for 1955, pp.
                                267–271.</note> This situation raises the question whether we can
                            safely assume that we can resist “firmly” Soviet efforts to link these
                            two issues and yet count upon obtaining a satisfactory membership
                            arrangement with the USSR. Once, however, we have indicated a
                            willingness to negotiate for a blanket deal, the present basis for our
                            membership position will have been lost.</p>
                        <p>The issue thus becomes: Is the need for general flexibility so great and
                            the chance of success in negotiations with the USSR on membership so
                            encouraging as to be worth endangering our position on Chinese
                            representation and forfeiting the moral and Charter basis of our
                            membership position? In my view if we are to stand firm on the Chinese
                            representation issue, we cannot afford the risks involved in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> proposal.</p>
                        <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0309"/>
                        <p>I believe, however, that an initiative toward implementation of the
                            Bandung suggestion would offer advantages with no apparent
                            disadvantages. If, as anticipated, the USSR vetoes the proposal in the
                            Security Council, the free world will have gained by showing an
                            initiative in support of a Bandung suggestion and the USSR will have
                            lost prestige. If unexpectedly the USSR approves the proposal, we shall
                            have obtained the admission of seven states, none of which belongs to
                            the Soviet bloc. Such an initiative might assist Japan in its current
                            negotiations with the USSR, and would not prejudice any membership
                            proposals which may later develop. Moreover, it would be desirable to
                            have taken an initiative involving Japan in case the USSR, as a result
                            of the current negotiations with Japan, undertakes to support or even
                            propose Japanese membership.</p>

                                    Article 4, cannot subject its favorable vote on the admission of
                                    that state to the additional condition that other states be
                                    admitted simultaneously. In the second, <pb n="285"

                                        and Vietnam) and of the five Soviet-sponsored candidates.
                                        The majority of Security Council members, including the
                                        United States, United Kingdom and France, have not accepted
                                        this package deal because it is contrary to the
                                        International Court’s opinion that each applicant should be
                                        considered separately, and because it includes applicants
                                        not considered qualified while excluding certain qualified
                                        applicants. The membership question has therefore remained
                                        deadlocked, the Soviet Union vetoing the non-Soviet
                                        applicants and the majority rejecting the Soviet-sponsored
                                        candidates or a package deal.</item>

                                        stalemate. The Eighth Session of the General Assembly
                                        unanimously decided to establish a Committee of Good

                                        with members of the Security Council to explore the
                                        possibility of reaching an understanding which would
                                        facilitate the admission of new members in accordance with
                                        Article 4 of the Charter. This Good Offices Committee was
                                        continued by unanimous action of the Ninth Session.
                                        Currently it has been seeking through extensive

                                xml:id="d113fn2">Telegram 419 from Colombo, June 15, summarized the
                                contents of a letter that Ceylonese Prime Minister Kotelawala sent
                                on June 6 to Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo calling for
                                action to implement the resolution adopted at the Bandung Conference
                                on membership in the United Nations for the seven Afro-Asian
                                countries. The letter stressed, in part, that (1) the seven
                                countries were being kept out of the United Nations by the vagaries
                                of the cold war and not because of any intrinsic lack of
                                eligibility, (2) the June 2 Soviet-Yugoslav declaration inferred no
                                further Soviet vetos of the admission of new Afro-Asian members, and
                                (3) while other countries might also be qualified for U.N.
                                membership the seven mentioned in the Bandung resolution should be
                                considered first because of the merit of their case. (<hi

                            British to agree to your great idea of non-member participation. If they
                            do agree, it means that we will have the votes to put it across in the
                            General Assembly this Fall. If we put it across, it will broaden and
                            change the character of the United Nations in the way that you always
                            advocated and the publicity and photographs coming out of the United
                            Nations will reflect the presence of Japan, Italy, Germany, etc., even
                            though they cannot vote. The fact that these countries, and others such
                            as Ireland, will be present will be very helpful in the light of
                            1956.</p>
                        <p>My basis for thinking that the British may go along is due to their acute
                            discomfort over our plans for Charter review. They really do not want
                            this at all and <persName corresp="#p_CPM1">Crosthwaite</persName>, the
                            British Minister in New York, has suggested a resolution which puts off
                            the holding of a review conference to which he invites our adherence. I
                            told him that his resolution was a very milk and water affair and that
                            Americans wanted to see some signs of development and growth in the
                            United Nations.</p>

                                might be made whereby the United States and the United Kingdom would
                                agree to a resolution postponing a Charter review conference and
                                another resolution putting into effect your scheme of non-member

                        <p>I realize that you have other things to take up with the British which

                                liberation of Soviet control. In view of this trend, I doubt that
                                the Department will be anxious to agree to any package deal which
                                involves the satellites presently not represented in the United

                            possibility of getting British support for your proposal on non-member
                            participation if we in return join the UK in a move to postpone a
                            Charter review conference. He suggests that you seek Macmillan’s
                            agreement to this “deal”.</p>
                        <p>We agree that it might at some stage be desirable to revive the
                            non-member participation idea if this is the only alternative to a
                            continuance of the present membership deadlock. If it is to be revived,
                            however, we believe we must be able to demonstrate to the qualified
                            applicants that there is in fact no serious prospect of a break in the
                            membership deadlock, and that non-member participation <pb n="290"
                                xml:id="pg_290" facs="0316"/>represents, for the foreseeable future,
                            the only feasible mechanism for their participation in the work of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Having in mind their negative
                            reaction to the non-member participation proposal when it was broached
                            to them last year and the increased expectation of a break in the
                            membership impasse aroused by the present atmosphere of relaxing
                            tensions, this would appear to be difficult if not impossible to do
                            until after we have once more tested Soviet intentions on the membership
                            question. We do not believe that the attitude of the qualified
                            applicants is apt to be substantially affected one way or another by the
                            position of the UK on the non-member participation idea.</p>
                        <p>A number of recent reports that the USSR may not use its veto on the
                            admission of various states (e.g. Austria, the Bandung group) have
                            contributed to optimistic speculation concerning the possibility of a
                            solution to the membership question. Although our information does not
                            conclusively substantiate these reports, it is reasonable to anticipate
                            some new Soviet move on membership at this time. The Indian delegation
                            has indicated that it may propose the admission of the Bandung group and
                            that they believe the USSR will neither oppose this group nor add to it
                            any unacceptable applicant. So long as there is a real possibility that
                            the Soviet Union will agree to the admission of any of the qualified
                            applicants, we would be playing into Soviet hands if in the meantime we
                            should revive the non-member participation idea, which the USSR could
                            claim was an attempt on our part to sidetrack a settlement of the
                            membership question. Other governments too might conclude that we had
                            ruled out any real solution to the membership problem.</p>
                        <p>To date the US has managed with increasing difficulty to keep the onus on
                            the USSR for the impasse on membership. If the USSR now adopts a more
                            flexible position, it will be even more difficult to combat the view
                            that it is the US rather than the Soviet Union which is blocking a
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>We believe, therefore, that action on the non-member participation idea
                            should be deferred at least until the membership question has been
                            reviewed by the Security Council and there has been an opportunity to
                            assess the situation in the General Assembly. In any event, we question
                            the advisability of linking non-member participation with Charter review
                            as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> suggests. We
                            see no bargaining advantage in this combination.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Cabot</persName></hi>: I have your note of July 29 with reference
                            to non-member participation. I spent considerable time today discussing
                            the problem of membership and the related problem of Charter review with
                            our people here, including <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Francis
                                Wilcox</persName>.</p>
                        <p>My feeling is this:</p>
                        <p>The acceptability by non-members of non-member participation seems at the
                            moment to be at a low ebb because of greater hopes for full membership.
                            These hopes were aroused by the Bandung communiqué which proposed seven
                            members, including Japan. There seems a fair prospect that the Soviet
                            Union may take these up. The hopes of Italy and Austria have recently
                            been increased by various Soviet hints. It could be that something might
                            be worked out on membership at the Security Council meeting which will
                            precede the General Assembly. I doubt that the non-member participation
                            business will get very far until at least that has been tried and either
                            succeeded or failed. If it succeeds, then the non-member participation
                            idea is unnecessary and there is less urgency about a Charter Review
                            Conference. If the present prospects of new members should fail, then I
                            think the non-member participation idea could be revived as an
                            alternative to an early Charter Review Conference.</p>
                        <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0318"/>
                        <p>We shall try to push our thinking along these lines so as to put you
                            rapidly in a position to talk with others. At the moment, however, I
                            think it is better for the Mission to avoid negotiations.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that his
                            Government was concerned about its position in the United Nations. It
                            was thought that in response to the new Communist peace propaganda
                            campaign, a group of nations might try to force the admission of
                            Communist China to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He said that
                            his Government was trying in every way possible to bolster its position
                            at the coming General Assembly session. Work was being done in New York
                            and elsewhere. But the Chinese Government needed and would like to ask
                            the help of the United States Government, which had more influence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> assured the Ambassador that the
                            American Government would assist in every way possible in maintaining
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> position of the Chinese

                                    >Pearson</persName> had spoken of “Communist China in a way
                                which implied that” the United States “should begin to think about
                                recognition and admission to the United Nations.” Secretary of State
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> “recalled that we
                                had not recognized the Soviet Union for sixteen years, and had
                                gotten along very well all during that period, better than
                                afterward. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> said
                                that the conditions about China were different.” The talk then

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said his

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said undoubtedly an effort would be

                            the Ceylonese Ambassador to the US had just made a speech urging the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> admission of Communist China at
                            the Forum being held by the School of Advanced International Studies of
                            Johns Hopkins University.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said he felt that
                            Great Britain would hold the key to the resolution of this issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> agreed that this might be the case. He
                            remarked that the British are quite upset over the bombing of British
                            vessels in South China ports by Chinese Nationalist planes. They have
                            just made a strong statement to us following the bombing of the <hi

                            British disposition to go along with the “moratorium” arrangement in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might be adversely affected by
                            their anger over the Chinese attacks on British shipping. Mr.
                                <persName>Robertson</persName> thought that a concerted effort would
                            be required to maintain the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said his
                            Government was doing everything it could, but its influence was
                            limited.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> assured the Ambassador that the matter

                            certain indications of a prospective relaxation of the Soviet position
                            on membership, with particular reference to the Bandung group and
                            possibly Austria (which the Soviets appear to want to link with the
                            other “peace treaty” states). It was mentioned also that such a change
                            in the Soviet attitude, should it in fact materialize, would be likely
                            to give new impetus to a tendency which was already discernible to shift
                            the onus for the membership deadlock from the USSR to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>In the present climate of relaxing tensions there can be little doubt
                            that expectations of a break in this deadlock are high, and that any
                            Member which allows itself to be placed in the position of appearing to
                            block an overall solution will incur the ill will of a large majority of
                            the other member nations, as well as of any qualified applicants which
                            may continue to be excluded. We have particularly in mind the situation
                            which would arise should the USSR press for the admission of all
                            outstanding applicants with the exception of the divided states of Korea
                            and Viet-Nam. Under our present position, we would have to oppose the
                            admission of the satellites, thus blocking a comprehensive package deal.
                            We would then have to be prepared to deal with Soviet acquiescence in
                            the admission of at least the Bandung group, and possibly also Austria.
                            Since presumably we could not oppose any of these, their admission would
                            be assured. The reaction of the remaining qualified applicants, and
                            particularly of Italy, would certainly be strong and vociferous. The
                            onus for Italy’s failure to gain admission would in the present
                            atmosphere attach not to the USSR, but to the U.S., a circumstance which
                            would tend to encourage a resurgence of Italian neutralist sentiment.
                            Moreover, the admission of the Bandung group alone would strengthen the
                            anti-colonial and neutralist forces in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and probably impel the UK, France, and other European
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Members to press for the admission
                            of Italy and Portugal even at the cost of admitting the European
                            satellites.</p>
                        <p>As indicative of the current thinking of other member nations on this
                            question, Canada, supported by Australia, has already expressed interest
                            in a package arrangement which would admit all of the outstanding
                            applicants (including the Mongolian Peoples Republic and the European
                            satellites) with the exception of Korea and Viet-Nam.</p>

                        <p>As an alternative I suggest that in your address you announce support for

                            confidence that in the prevailing atmosphere it will be possible to
                            admit not only these states but also certain other states, notably in
                            Europe. It may develop that states such as Italy and Austria will prove
                            acceptable to both sides in the new circumstances. If the USSR insists
                            upon all or nothing, the responsibility for the impasse will rest there.
                            A piecemeal approach of this sort offers a reasonable effort toward
                            breaking the deadlock without the risks and sacrifices involved in the

                            <item>The proposal involves our acquiescing in the admission of the
                                European satellites. Three of the four satellites stand condemned by
                                the General Assembly for “wilful refusal” to fulfill a Peace Treaty
                                obligation and all four have been condemned year by year by the US
                                and other delegations for violating human rights and accepted codes
                                of conduct. The President has just felt it necessary to emphasize
                                that relaxation of tensions does not involve relaxation of
                                principles on our part.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The proposal involves an undertaking that the US “will not use its
                                vote” to prevent or “will no longer oppose” the admission of any
                                state which receives seven or more votes in the Security Council.
                                The implications for the Chinese representation issue of the
                                announcement of this change in US policy toward the satellites will
                                be immediately evident to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members.
                                At your press conference on July 8 last year you said that “…<note
                                    n="2" xml:id="d119fn2">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> if
                                you look at the substance of the matter rather than the form, the
                                question of the eligibility of a new government should be subject to
                                the same voting tests as the admission of a new state.” <gloss
                                    target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> proposes that you explain that our
                                willingness to acquiesce in the seating of the satellites despite
                                our views as to their eligibility does not mean that we are prepared
                                to consider the seating of “any regime which has been convicted of
                                aggression by the United Nations and which has yet to purge itself
                                of that aggression”, and specifically that we continue to oppose any
                                change in Chinese representation. This explanation serves to make
                                clear to all that we realize the dilemma which our <pb n="299"
                                    xml:id="pg_299" facs="0325"/>change in policy creates with
                                respect to Chinese representation. It also strips our opposition to
                                the Chinese Communists of all objections except the sole issue of
                                aggression. Objections based on violations of human rights and
                                treaty obligations, mistreatment of American and other foreign
                                nationals, etc. are discarded. It carries the unmistakable
                                suggestion that once the finding of aggression is lifted we can be
                                expected to acquiesce in their seating. This statement would be made
                                at the very time when we shall need all possible strength to
                                maintain our position in favor of the seating of the Chinese
                                Nationalists and against the seating of the Chinese
                                Communists.</item>

                            <item>The recommendations on Korea and Viet-Nam are not entirely clear.
                                Under recommendation 1, we would apparently be willing to drop both
                                if the Commonwealth and France objected to their inclusion, while
                                recommendation 2b apparently contemplates our including both in our
                                proposal. Both would in any case be subject to a Soviet veto, for
                                our self-denying policy would not be contingent on the acceptance of
                                a similar policy by the USSR.</item>

                        <p>The Acting Secretary said that he had invited Sir
                                <persName>Robert</persName> to call this afternoon in order to
                            discuss with him a very important question, namely, that of Chinese
                            representation in the United Nations. After reciting briefly the history
                            of the U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> moratorium arrangement
                            on Chinese representation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> said that we had been concerned at the recent
                            suggestion of the British Government that a change be made in the
                            procedural formula used heretofore in avoiding consideration of the
                            question of seating the Chinese Communists in the General Assembly. He
                            said that any change in the formula, such as that suggested by the
                            British Government, which could be interpreted as a weakening of this
                            Government’s position with regard to Chinese representation could have
                            very serious repercussions in the United States which could involve our
                            relations with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth nations as well
                            as our participation in the United Nations. He pointed out that the
                            Congress and the public in this country are unanimously opposed to the
                            seating of the Chinese Communists and the reaction on the part of the
                            public here to any apparent change in our attitude would be pronounced
                            and immediate. There had been exchanges between the U.S. and <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> Delegations in New York on this subject
                                <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0327"/>but some time had now
                            elapsed since this Government’s views had been called to the attention
                            of the United Kingdom Delegation and we had not yet received any
                            definitive reply from the British Government. We were bringing this
                            matter up again through our Embassy in London and hoped that Sir
                                <persName>Robert</persName> would also report our views to his
                            Government with a view to obtaining an early favorable decision.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Robert</persName> said that it was his understanding that
                            the British Government’s attitude toward the moratorium had not changed
                            basically but that a slight alteration of the formula had been suggested
                            to prevent the loss of any votes when this matter came to be acted upon
                            by the General Assembly. He referred particularly to developments
                            arising from the Bandung Conference in this connection. He would, of
                            course, report our views to his Government. Meanwhile, he wished to
                            assure us that the United Kingdom Government desires a harmonious
                            relationship with the United States in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. He realized that we felt very strongly on this subject
                            of Chinese representation but he wished to point out that the British
                            Government feels just as strongly on the subject of any discussion of
                            the Cyprus question by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and he
                            reminded the Acting Secretary that the British Government has appealed
                            in the strongest terms for American support in avoiding such discussion.
                            He made it very apparent that he considered that the United States
                            should cooperate with the United Kingdom on this matter if we expected
                            the latter to accede to our suggestion regarding Chinese representation.
                            In any event, he said, this question of Chinese representation will soon
                            come to a head and he doubted that it could be avoided after this
                            year.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Robert</persName> was told that we were awaiting the
                            outcome of the British-Turk-Greek talks in London on the Cyprus question
                            before determining our final position for the forthcoming General
                            Assembly session. Sir <persName>Robert</persName> said there seemed
                            little reason to suppose that the Greeks would not proceed with their
                            plan to introduce the resolution on the subject, though he admitted that
                            there was a chance that the London talks might have the happy result of
                            inducing the Greeks to refrain from such action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> raised the question of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> censure resolution against Communist
                            China which named it as an aggressor and said that he assumed that
                            action would have to be taken to rescind this resolution before
                            consideration could be given to Chinese Communist representation. Sir
                                <persName>Robert</persName> said that he had not considered this
                            angle but had assumed that a vote to seat the Chinese Communists as the
                            representatives of China would suffice.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Robert</persName> said that he would report this
                            conversation immediately to his Foreign Office.</p>

                        <p>260. Re Chinese Representation. <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1"
                                >Dixon</persName> paid an official call to tell me that Her
                            Majesty’s Govt, only “after considerable hesitation and reluctance” had
                            agreed to the moratorium on Chinese representation. He said that this
                            “had been a hard decision” and that he had been instructed to emphasize
                            to me that there was “strong political feeling in both parties that the
                            time has come to admit the Chinese Communists, and that this indefinite
                            postponement was more and more embarrassing to <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss> and increasingly more and more difficult to
                            defend”.</p>
                        <p>He said that the British Government felt that the formula of using the
                            words “not yet” should have been accepted by the US.</p>
                        <p>He wished to stress that the British Government had agreed to the
                            moratorium only in a “spirit of comradeship” but that they do disagree
                            and that the sense of comradeship does riot mean agreement. He wished to
                            make it clear that it was “highly doubtful that the British Government
                            could maintain this line much longer”.</p>
                        <p>I made it clear that there was a definite relationship between the
                            American attitude and the behavior of the Chinese Communists but also
                            made it clear that it was quite out of the question to expect any change
                            of the American attitude in 1956.</p>

                        <p>284. For the Acting Secretary. Suggest urgent message be sent to all our
                            Embassies in Latin America urging our Ambassador to call on the Foreign
                            Office to request the support of govt for our position on the Chinese
                            representation question. So far we are unable to get <pb n="303"
                                xml:id="pg_303" facs="0329"/>satisfactory assurances of support from
                            members of this group. I am meeting with them all personally Monday
                            afternoon, but if the vote takes place Tuesday afternoon there will not
                            be time to communicate with Latin America between Monday afternoon and
                            Tuesday afternoon. Hope, therefore, that these approaches to the Latin
                            American govts can be carried out immediately.</p>

                                    recapitulates the existing policies. Nevertheless, if you do
                                    have a chance to glance at it before I make it and have any
                                    thoughts you may wish to give me, I would be very happy to

                        <p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 4. In conversation with Secretary
                            last evening Macmillan raised question of new membership in <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He said to him there appeared two
                            possibilities: one, to accept the principle of universality which would
                            mean including Albania, Outer Mongolia, etc., the other, to postpone
                            whole question another year. He asked Secretary’s views.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said US could not agree vote for package deal including such
                            members as Hungary, Albania, Outer Mongolia, etc. He said even if
                            Security Council waived right make recommendations regarding new
                            membership, US was not prepared in any ad seriatum vote on new members
                            in General Assembly to agree in advance to vote for all members in what
                            would in effect be a package deal. Secretary said we are prepared to
                            vote in General Assembly for countries on basis of merits of their
                            application and in particular to vote for the seven countries proposed
                            by Bandung Conference, plus Japan and friendly Western European
                            applications. Secretary added we had given serious consideration to
                            voting for Albania if Soviets <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0331"
                            />agreed to entry of Austria, Italy and Bandung countries plus Japan.
                            Reason for this is Albania does not have outstanding against it any
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or other charge of violating human
                            rights, etc. In other words, it would be easier for us agree to
                            Albania’s inclusion in return for inclusion friendly countries than it
                            would be agree to inclusion of Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria which have
                            violated fundamental human rights, and with which US in particular has
                            serious grievances because of actions these governments.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Macmillan then suggested one possible means of handling question was for
                            US, UK and other like-minded countries take position they did not
                            approve veto of new members by Security Council and that therefore they
                            might say that membership question should be referred to General
                            Assembly on basis that each country was to be considered on an
                            individual basis and not on basis of any package or block deal.
                            Macmillan said that in view of lateness of hour, he would not pursue
                            this discussion further but felt problem of new membership was something
                            which we should all be thinking about and be in touch with during coming
                            days of present General Assembly meeting.</p>

                        <p>Between September 27 and October 1, members of the United States and
                            Soviet Delegations at the United Nations held a number of conversations
                            on the issue of membership. The first of these took place following a
                            discussion of other matters when the Vice Chairman of the Soviet
                            Delegation to the United Nations, <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Vasili
                                Kuznetsov</persName>, suddenly remarked to <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> that Soviet Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Vyacheslav Molotov</persName> had made a
                            proposal on membership and that the Soviets wished to talk to the United
                            States about it. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> replied
                            that he understood that <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                            had proposed admitting 16 new members but had not said which ones and,
                            in view of the fact there were 22 prospective candidates for membership,
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> which 6 the
                            Soviet proposal did not include. <persName corresp="#p_KVV1"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName> replied that the 6 were Japan, North and South
                            Korea, North and South Vietnam, and Spain.</p>

                            requested instructions, and suggested that the Department’s first
                            consideration should be whether the list should be appraised in
                            alphabetical order or chronologically, that a rule then be adopted by
                            the Security Council “stipulating the applicants be called in the order
                            we have selected, that there be no debate, that the five permanent
                            members agree not to use the veto and that the issue be settled by a
                            majority vote.” (Department of State, Central Files, 310.2/9–2755)</p>

                                >Lodge</persName> gave the same response when <persName

                            Italian peace treaties signed in 1947. The Italians, therefore, consider
                            that among the Western nations Italy has priority on the basis both of
                            the peace treaty and date of application for membership.</p>
                        <p>The latest development was in Foreign Minister Martino’s general foreign
                            policy speech before the Italian Parliament on September 27, when
                            according to our Embassy’s report, he “stressed that Italy would
                            consider unfriendly any action to elect other countries without Italy”.
                            Such strong language applied to friendly and unfriendly governments
                            alike is probably intended to impress upon us the seriousness with which
                            the Italian Government regards this question. Should Martino’s
                            assessment of Italian public opinion have been exaggerated (which we are
                            not really in position to charge), such a statement would tend to
                            produce the opinion he believes already exists.</p>
                        <p>That the Soviet Union is and has been responsible for the situation in
                            which Italy finds itself is true. Nevertheless, the fact that the
                            Soviets are now willing to accept a large or small package, either
                            including Italy, would, I believe, result in the United States <pb
                                n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0334"/>being held responsible by the
                            Italian Government and public should some other state or states obtain
                            admission without Italy. Such a potentiality in an allied country where
                            the “Geneva spirit” constitutes an exceedingly serious problem for the
                            government and where the electorate is already 35% social-communist
                            warrants the most serious consideration in connection with United States
                            decisions and actions regarding <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>

                        <p>When the French Ambassador called on the Secretary yesterday to explain
                            French withdrawal from the General Assembly, the conversation turned to
                            the future composition of the United Nations should a formula be found
                            for the admission of new members. The Secretary speculated on the
                            feasibility of a formula whereby neither the Soviets nor the other four
                            permanent members of the Security Council would use the veto. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> suggested that in such
                            an event an abstention rather than a negative vote would better meet the
                            legal requirements. The Soviet satellites were discussed as examples and
                            the French Ambassador expressed the view that even though the
                                U.S.,<gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, France and China should
                            abstain the Soviets and the other six Security Council members voting
                            affirmatively would give the required seven votes for membership. He
                            added, however, that it would be difficult for countries like New
                            Zealand <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0335"/>and Belgium to vote
                            with the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> and not follow
                            the example of their Allies in the case of the satellites. The Secretary
                            agreed that it was likely that the Soviet delegation would insist on
                            some prearranged understanding to assure that their protégés would not
                            be excluded under the formula by either the Council or the
                                Assembly.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was asked about the United
                                Nations membership question at his press conference on October 4 and
                                replied, in part, as follows: “I think that our position on all
                                United Nations memberships is substantially the same as it has been
                                in the past. We have never believed that the Security Council should
                                operate as an agency for the vetoing of members… . We believe that
                                candidates should be considered on their merits; they should not be
                                arbitrarily vetoed in the Security Council… . There are some nations
                                which, it seems to me, have made clear that they are not either
                                peace-loving, or able or willing to carry out their obligations
                                under the charter, and we doubt that they should be allowed to come
                                into the United Nations in violation of the charter, or merely in
                                order to get other eligible nations in.” For a complete text, see

                                1955, pp. 604–608.</note> At the end of his call the Ambassador
                            asked the Secretary about the plans of the Disarmament Subcommittee. The
                            latter replied that the Canadian objection to the early recess of the
                            Subcommittee had been overcome and there now seemed to be no obstacle to
                            its adjournment some time next week.</p>

                                Portugal would have general Congressional approval. Japan would be
                                received with less enthusiasm, but the total reaction would be
                                favorable. There would be little enthusiasm for Nepal and the Jewish

                        <p>I informed him of the reactions of the British and Chinese to the
                            proposition of abstention from use of the veto, and also said that while

                            still in a state of war with that country, and said that some way would
                            have to be found to get around that. Regarding Spain, while denying

                                Conference of October 27–November 16.</note> Re: <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership. I met with <persName
                                corresp="#p_OP1">Ordonneau</persName> (France) and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> (UK) at latter’s request to
                            discuss membership.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> opened meeting by saying
                            that when Macmillan was here he had discussed <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> membership with number of delegations and had been
                            button-holed by number of others. Macmillan had found considerable
                            pressure from observers, from non-member countries, and would-be
                            promoters of solution of membership problem, <persName corresp="#p_NA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> said. He referred to rising tide at that time in
                            favor solution, a tide which since then “has not ebbed and in fact
                            continues to rise in part due to fact Soviets have been fishing around
                            and dropping hints” of their willingness to support a group of 18,
                            including Japan and possibly Spain. <persName corresp="#p_NA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> informed us that Foreign Office is convinced we
                            cannot stand in way of rising tide and UK is therefore now prepared to
                            support a proposal, if made, along the lines of Canadian proposal.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> described this as a
                            behind-the-scenes prior agreement between West and Soviet Union to
                            “promote, support or acquiesce in admission of membership of group of
                            18”. (This would include Japan, Spain and Outer Mongolia, and exclude
                            divided states.) UK wants to inform Canadians of this position ….
                                <persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> suggested a four-power
                            get-together here, including Canadians, after US has communicated its
                            views to UK. I informed <persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> I
                            would communicate his government’s views to Department.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_OP1">Ordonneau</persName>, while speaking
                            personally and without instructions, understood French view to be that
                            they would not renounce veto, since it was only reason for staying in
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. However, this was not to <pb
                                n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0341"/>say, added <persName
                                corresp="#p_OP1">Ordonneau</persName>, that France would actually
                            use veto on question of admission of new members. He further expressed
                            personal view that Paris would not welcome prospect of “more additions
                            to zoo”. <persName corresp="#p_OP1">Ordonneau</persName> also indicated
                            his personal view that France might adopt principle of abstention with
                            few limited exceptions such as Italy, which France would wish to
                            support.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> agreed that in light of
                            fact French have no instructions, a four-power meeting here may be
                            premature. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName>
                            is anxious to tell Canadians confidentially of UK position ….</p>
                        <p>In brief discussion procedure which could be used in Security Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> said it would be
                            necessary to work out a plan in order to insure that applicants would
                            receive required seven votes. There was also some discussion regarding
                            fact that certain members would not wish to vote affirmatively on
                            certain satellite states. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_NA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> said …. <persName corresp="#p_CPM1"
                                >Crosthwaite</persName> (UK) recalled that in conversation with

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> said Macmillan might have a

                                >Lodge</persName>. Subject: Membership. If it appears to you that we
                            are losing popularity with Italy and other nations over the membership
                            question and that blame is being put on US for inaction, I suggest the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>That I be authorized to let it be understood that the US would certainly
                            be interested in an arrangement whereby all applicants except the two
                            Koreas, the two Vietnams, and Outer Mongolia are elected to
                            membership.</p>
                        <p>We have <persName corresp="#p_MTB1">Morton</persName>’s estimate that
                            unfavorable reaction in Congress to the admission of satellites would be
                            more than counterbalanced by admission of such nations as Ireland, Italy
                            and Spain. From the standpoint of protecting US interests here the
                            situation would <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0343"/>not be any more
                            difficult than it is now. In fact, it might be slightly easier.</p>
                        <p>The Canadians are circulating a so-called secret draft resolution,
                            presumably to friendly delegations, whereby the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> would endorse admission of the “group of 18, including
                            Spain”. This would include Outer Mongolia. We are advised that the
                            Canadian resolution has the approval of the Canadian cabinet.</p>
                        <p>The situation is developing rather quickly. My motive is more to prevent
                            damage to the US than to solve the membership question.</p>

                                he said in effect <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could have been
                                a non-Communist organization but that a number of Communist states
                                were already in and that a few more did not make any difference and
                                once it was apparent Chiang Kai-shek could not recapture the
                                mainland it would be necessary to admit Communist China. I was
                                greatly struck by this observation coming from head of most
                                anti-Communist state (hope this will not make Robertson’s ulcers

                                Central Files, 310.2/11–255)</note> am deeply impressed by
                            passionate desire of these countries to get into <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. I was surprised to find feeling in Spain seems fully as
                            strong as in Italy. Spanish say they filed application at our suggestion
                            and would never have done so had it not been taken for granted this
                            meant we would get them in. To have applied and be rebuffed would be
                            galling to Spanish pride and intolerable.</p>
                        <p>I recalled Franco’s urging to keep resistance movement hopefully active
                            and said satellite admission would tend to damage will to resist. Reply

                            could not be compensated for by using veto to keep European satellites

                        <p>Two questions present themselves: (1) is it possible handle matters so we

                            against satellites <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, although we would

                            (2) if in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> we had to abstain on
                            satellites to get our friends in, we would as a minimum have to express
                            our views re non-representative character of satellite governments and

                                Secretary of Embassy.</note> approached me with an inquiry regarding
                            the membership problem. He first inquired as to the meaning of the
                            Canadian draft resolution and did a little shadow-boxing on the method
                            of treatment of the resolution in the Ad Hoc Committee. He professed to
                            understand that the consensus in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            was that it should be taken up early next week in the Ad Hoc
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>It was pretty clear that he really was under instructions to find out
                            what was the present status of our inquiries of the other permanent
                            members as the result of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName>’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KVV1"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName>. I spent most of my words endeavoring not to
                            give any answers but still to retain our initiative and interest in the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>After a certain amount of chit-chat he agreed, as one might expect a
                            Soviet to do, that the first positive step in solution of the membership
                            question must be private but firm understanding amongst the permanent
                            members of the Security Council. He also agreed that discussion of
                            membership in the Ad Hoc Committee, presumably to be followed by
                            recommendation to the Security Council on the membership applications of
                            a certain group of countries, could hardly be helpful and might well be
                            harmful since the necessity of speaking in public would be likely to
                            give rise to reiteration of old positions and hinder the possibility of
                            progress in private conversations.</p>
                        <p>In the conversation he first started speaking of the 18 countries
                            mentioned by Canada but later, and quite purposefully I am sure,
                            referred to 16 and, a couple of times, 17 applicants.</p>
                        <p>He indicated considerable interest in the question of whether the Soviets
                            now should rely on negotiations in New York to proceed in this matter or
                            to take the question up at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>If he is representative of the Soviet viewpoint, the Soviets would hope
                            that there would be some indication of progress in the private
                            negotiations and if this were the case would prefer to defer <pb n="320"
                                xml:id="pg_320" facs="0346"/>any Ad Hoc Committee action. He, as
                            always, was insistent on the necessity of some sort of solid assurance
                            to the Soviets regarding the admission of their candidates. He suggested
                            that it would be necessary to have some sort of informal meeting of the
                            Security Council members prior to the formal session which would take
                            membership action.</p>
                        <p>I think that if we are really interested in the solution of the
                            membership matter on terms acceptable to us we should be able to give
                            the Soviets some sort of an answer in the very near future as to the
                            prospects. They would, I think, be prepared to go along with us to defer
                            Ad Hoc consideration if we were able to convince them that we are in
                            fact moving forward, however slowly.</p>
                        <p>If we are not able to have some such conversation with them, I would
                            expect they will assume that our previous conversations have been
                            insincere and that they will proceed to use the membership question for
                            the utmost propaganda effect.</p>

                                corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName>. After considerable thought I
                            have concluded that I should be authorized to make the following
                            statement to the press:</p>
                        <p>“Thirteen deserving and qualified nations have been blocked from
                            admission to the United Nations because of Soviet Russia’s abuse of the
                            veto power in the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>This list includes such important nations as Italy, Japan and Spain.</p>
                        <p>It includes such small, but old and civilized, nations of the Western
                            world as Austria, Finland, Eire, and Portugal—nations whose sons have
                            also contributed to much of our own national culture.</p>
                        <p>It includes in the Near East and Far East: Cambodia, Ceylon, Jordan,
                            Laos, Libya and Nepal. All of these nations have emerged into
                            sovereignty since the Charter was written and have made distinctive
                            contributions to the free world. Many of the Asian nations, in
                            particular, were specifically endorsed for membership by the Bandung
                            Conference of last spring—a list which the United States had
                            endorsed.</p>
                        <p>In his speech at the opening of the General Assembly on September 22nd,
                            Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed
                            out ’that our organization’s power derives largely from moral judgments
                            formed here’ and that, therefore, it is essential ’that there should be
                            here all of those eligible nations which, by their policies and conduct,
                            have demonstrated their devotion to the purposes and principles of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> charter’.</p>
                        <p>He went on to point out that ’about a score of sovereign nations are not
                            represented here and many of them meet the membership tests of our
                            charter. They are peace-loving and they have shown themselves able and
                            willing to carry out the Charter’s obligations. Their governments would
                            reflect here important segments of world opinion. To block the admission
                            of such nations by use of the veto power is a grave wrong, not only to
                            them, but it is also a wrong to this organization and to all of its
                            members. I hope that during this tenth session action will be taken by
                            the Security Council and by this Assembly to bring these nations into
                            our membership. Thus, the <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0348"
                            />United Nations would enter its second decade better equipped to serve
                            mankind’.</p>
                        <p>It is reported that the Soviet Union will withhold its veto and that
                            these free nations can become members of the United Nations if the free
                            world is willing not to block the admission of governments behind the
                            so-called ’iron curtain’—governments which are not equals among equals
                            as are the large and small nations of the free world, but are in a
                            subordinate relationship to Moscow. We refer to Albania, Bulgaria,
                            Hungary and Rumania.</p>
                        <p>We will not disguise our feeling that to see such governments enter the
                            United Nations is not pleasant for anyone who takes seriously the words
                            of the Charter.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there is an overriding argument which, after mature
                            consideration, seems to us to outweigh this drawback. This is that the
                            admission of these 13 free nations greatly outweighs the admission of
                            the 4—because the 13 nations would add so tremendously to the moral
                            weight of the United Nations. In fact, if these 13 whom we support were
                            all admitted, the balance in the General Assembly with a total
                            membership of 77 would be even more heavily weighted in favor of the
                            free world than it is now with 60.</p>
                        <p>There is also reason to hope that membership in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will to some extent bring the people of
                            Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania closer to freedom.</p>
                        <p>We must speak too with warm and friendly feeling of the Republic of Korea
                            and of the Republic of South Vietnam whose allies and supporters we are
                            but who, because their territory is divided, cannot reasonably hope for
                            admission in the present state of the world.</p>
                        <p>For all these reasons, the United States intends to vote for the
                            admission of the thirteen and to raise no objection to the four
                            mentioned above.”</p>
                        <p>For your information, the arguments for this course, in addition to those
                            which are contained in the statement itself, are as follows: <list>

                                    have to accede to it or incur considerable unpopularity

                                    nations to be admitted. Yesterday the Japanese observer said in
                                    front of a large group of people that “the United States holds
                                    the key”. The Spanish observer is spreading reports that the
                                    Latin Americans will gladly vote for a satellite if Spain is
                                    admitted—which I believe to be completely true.</item>

                            operation” and that it should all be worked out on paper in advance to
                            avoid misunderstanding. I went on to say to <persName corresp="#p_KVV1"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName> that we should be straightforward in dealing
                            with this matter and not attempt any sharp practices such as calling the
                            list of applicants in chronological or alphabetical order, etc., and
                            thereby not reaching certain controversial countries. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>I feel that if we were to abstain in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            and vote against satellites in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, our
                            position would be more difficult for American public to understand than
                            if we abstained throughout. We would, in fact, be saying in one forum
                            that we were in effect willing to allow the satellites in and in the
                            other forum by voting against them give the contrary impression. This
                            would weaken our position with others in <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss>, would confuse our friends, and would not mollify those
                            who are adamant on the satellite question. All of this is quite apart
                            from fact that, as indicated above, Soviets are not likely to approve
                            any arrangement that is not “entire operation”.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have over the years been the object of much adverse criticism
                            because of their abuse of the veto on the membership question. But world
                            opinion seems to have moved on from there; it recognizes Soviet
                            intransigence as an unpalatable fact—but a fact nevertheless, and will
                            censure us and hold us responsible if new members do not get in.</p>
                        <p>I hope you will agree with me that timing of my proposed statement is
                            important and that while you will of course wish to discuss matter with
                            Macmillan and Pinay, I feel we should not delay unduly taking step I
                            propose. UK <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> has already,
                            without awaiting our views, announced its support for Canadian proposal
                            which includes Outer Mongolia. For this reason alone I feel our
                            statement should be made promptly. At present I favor a US resolution
                            thereafter which does not include Outer Mongolia, which <pb n="325"
                                xml:id="pg_325" facs="0351"/>would take precedence over other
                            resolutions, and would thus require the supporters of Outer Mongolia to
                            make an affirmative effort. I also favor proceeding first in <gloss

                        <p>As you know I am disposed favorably to consider package membership
                            arrangement in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. I do not see however
                            how we can bring ourselves to swallow Outer Mongolia and from our talks
                            on the general subject I have understood you shared this view. It seems
                            we would be on firm ground in opposing its admission particularly in
                            light of its exclusion from the list of applicants approved by the
                            Bandung Conference. Word reaches me from New York that the Canadians
                            have specifically included Outer Mongolia in their draft resolution and
                            that your Delegation is freely indicating to other Delegations their
                            support for the Canadian resolution as it stands including Outer
                            Mongolia. If your views on the matter are as I understand them to be I
                            wonder if you might make them clear to the Canadians as well as to your

                        <p>“Governor <persName corresp="#p_AS1">Adams</persName> brought to the
                            President’s attention the package deal now being discussed before the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as to the addition of thirteen new
                            members on the side of the Free World, including Italy and Japan, Spain
                            and Portugal; and on the side of the Soviet, four nations—Bulgaria,
                            Rumania, Albania and Hungary.</p>
                        <p>“The President said: ’I can’t personally see any great defeat for us
                            here. These countries are small nations. We would be getting in Italy
                            and Japan. The countries of Bulgaria, Rumania, Hungary and Albania will
                            of course always vote with the Russians, and we might find one or two of
                            the others voting against us. But look at the size of the population of
                            Japan and Italy—look at the representation we would have coming in. We
                            are anxious to build up the morale and the moral consciousness of both
                            Japan and Italy. I think on balance I would favor it.</p>

                        <list>
                            <item>”1. In his speech at the opening of the General Assembly on
                                September 22nd, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                    >Dulles</persName> pointed out ‘that our organization’s power
                                derives largely from moral judgments formed here’ and that,
                                therefore, it is essential ’that there should be here all of those
                                eligible nations which, by their policies and conduct, have
                                demonstrated their devotion to the purposes and principles of <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter’.</item>
                            <item>2. He went on to point out that ’about a score of sovereign
                                nations are not represented here and many of them meet the
                                membership tests of our charter. They are peace-loving and they have
                                shown themselves able and willing to carry out the Charter’s
                                obligations. Their govts would reflect here important segments of
                                world opinion. To block the admission of such nations by use of the
                                veto power is a grave wrong, not only to them, but it is also a
                                wrong to this organization and to all of its members. I hope that
                                during this Tenth Session action will be taken by the Security
                                Council and by the General Assembly to bring these nations into our
                                membership. Thus, the United Nations would enter its second decade
                                better equipped to serve mankind’.</item>
                            <item>3. Twelve of the thirteen deserving and qualified nations have
                                been blocked from admission to the United Nations because of Soviet
                                Russia’s abuse of the veto power in the Security Council. The
                                Security Council has not as yet acted on the application of
                                Spain.</item>
                            <item>4. In the European area, the list includes Italy, Austria,
                                Finland, Eire, and Portugal.</item>
                            <item>5. In the Near and Far East, it includes Cambodia, Ceylon, Japan,
                                Jordon, Laos, Libya, and Nepal. These were specifically endorsed for
                                membership at the Bandung Conference of last spring.</item>
                            <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0355"/>
                            <item>6. It is reported that the Soviet Union will withhold its veto and
                                that these free nations can become members of the United Nations if
                                the free world is willing not to block the admission of govts behind
                                the so-called ’iron curtain’—govts which are not equals among equals
                                as are the nations of the free world, but are in a subordinate
                                relationship to Moscow. We refer to Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and
                                Rumania.</item>
                            <item>7. To see such govts enter the United Nations is not to approve
                                their systems of govt nor condone the violations of human rights
                                which the govts of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania have persistently
                                engaged in.</item>
                            <item>8. On the other hand, there is an overriding argument which, after
                                mature consideration, seems to us to outweigh this drawback. This is
                                that the admission of these 13 free nations greatly outweighs the
                                admission of the 4—because the 13 nations would add so tremendously
                                to the moral weight of the United Nations.</item>
                            <item>9. There is also reason to hope that membership in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will to some extent bring the people
                                of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania closer to freedom.</item>
                            <item>10. For these reasons, the United States intends to vote for the
                                admission of the thirteen and to abstain on the four mentioned
                                above.”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>You will observe particularly that we have omitted any reference to
                            divided countries because of the difficulties of treating with Federal
                            Republic of Germany which while it has not yet applied for membership,
                            is nevertheless a divided state.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Herb</hi>: I have carefully reviewed the
                            messages you sent me yesterday with regard to the “Package” plan for the
                            admission of new <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members. I addressed
                            myself particularly to the consequences of admitting the four European
                            Soviet satellites, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, and Albania, and to the
                            Outer Mongolia question.</p>
                        <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0356"/>
                        <p>Before he left <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">FOSTER</persName> spoke to me
                            about the satellite admission problem. I told him that I thought the
                            effect, at least initially, would be unfavorable as regards the efforts
                            we are making to build up morale and maintain the hope of eventual
                            liberation in these countries. I added that I did not think this effect
                            would be disastrous over the long run and that I realized that on the
                            political side the State Department had to weigh the great advantages to
                            be derived from bringing in a substantial group of Western oriented
                            states against the disadvantages of taking in the satellites.</p>
                        <p>On further consideration I see no reason to change that position.</p>
                        <p>If it is decided to proceed, I think it would be possible to strengthen
                            the portion of <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot Lodge</persName>’s
                            proposed statement which deals with the satellites, and I have submitted
                            in the enclosure a suggested rephrasing. You may find parts of it too
                            stiff, but I felt we should put in all our thoughts and leave it to you
                            and <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName> to apply the
                            scissors.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, I feel that it is most important that both <gloss

                            time to prepare for this announcement, naturally on a highly
                            confidential basis, so that they can immediately explain in vigorous
                            terms the reasons for our action along the lines of the attached
                            memorandum.</p>

                                PM—beginning with third full paragraph page 2, through end of

                            <p>It is reported that the Soviet Union will withhold its veto and that
                                these free nations can become members of the United Nations, if the
                                free world is willing not to block the admission of the
                                    [regimes]<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">The word “governments” was

                                of four countries from behind the Iron Curtain—Albania, <pb n="331"
                                    xml:id="pg_331" facs="0357"/>Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania.</p>
                            <p>The peoples of these countries, as distinct from the regimes
                                presently imposed upon them, have proud national heritages. Their
                                history is full of examples of courageous devotion to the cause of
                                national freedom and independence. We have not forgotten that about
                                a century ago the Hungarian patriot, Kossuth, came to this free
                                country to gain our support for his brave struggle to free his
                                native land.</p>
                            <p>Citizens of these countries have also in the past made great
                                contributions in nearly every field of human endeavor. If
                                represented by governments of their own choosing, they would have
                                much to offer the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Then they would
                                be in a position to send as delegates to this organization those who
                                could speak for their real aspirations and defend their true
                                national interests. Under these conditions we could all welcome
                                their election to membership.</p>
                            <p>But the governments of those four countries, as they are constituted
                                today, are neither representative of the majority will of their
                                peoples nor free in their relation with other states to advance
                                their own national interests and objectives. Those governments were
                                initially imposed by naked military force, and it is force not free
                                consent that keeps them in power—force exercised by concentration
                                camps, secret police and foreign troops. In international affairs,
                                these governments are not free agents but are completely under the
                                control of the Soviet Union, whose foreign policy and economic needs
                                determine their every decision.</p>
                            <p>For these reasons, the United States has never been in favor of the
                                admission of these four regimes.<note n="4" xml:id="d145fn4">The
                                    phrase “governments, and we propose to abstain on the vote if
                                    their names are presented.” was deleted from the text and the
                                    word “regimes” added by hand.</note> It has seemed to us,
                                however, that the addition to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                membership of 13 free nations with all the understanding and support
                                they can give to the cause of the free world more than outweighs the
                                disadvantages of permitting the four satellites to join.</p>
                            <p>In no sense does the abstention of the U.S. on the issue of satellite
                                membership indicate that we accept as permanent the present
                                situation in these four countries in Eastern Europe. As President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> stated at the
                                Geneva Conference in July: “On a broader plane, there is the problem
                                of respecting the right of peoples to choose the form of government
                                under which they will live; and of restoring sovereign rights and
                                self-government to those who have been deprived of them. The
                                American people feel strongly that certain peoples of Eastern
                                Europe, many with a long and proud record of national existence,
                                have not yet been given the benefit of <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332"
                                    facs="0358"/>this pledge of our United Nations wartime
                                declaration, reinforced by other wartime agreements.”</p>
                            <p>Again, as President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                                stated in August when speaking in Philadelphia before the American
                                Bar Association: “The domination of captive countries cannot longer
                                be justified by any claim that this is needed for purposes of
                                security. …<note n="5" xml:id="d145fn5">Ellipses in this paragraph
                                    are in the source text.</note> Very probably the reason for
                                these and other violations of the rights of men and of nations is a
                                compound of suspicions and fear. That explains. It cannot excuse. In
                                justice to others and to ourselves we can never accept these wrongs
                                as a part of the peace that we desire and we seek. …”</p>
                            <p>The satellite regimes of Poland and Czechoslovakia have long enjoyed
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership. Unfortunately this
                                fact has neither helped them to win popular support at home nor to
                                advance their interests abroad. The convinced Communists who will
                                largely make up the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegations of
                                these four new members will obtain only the ritualistic satisfaction
                                of having followed Kremlin instructions on how to vote and what to
                                say. But there may be some members of these delegations who will
                                learn much in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and whose
                                contacts here may widen the possibilities for freedom of their
                                people.</p>
                            <p>The determined opposition of the majority of the people of these
                                countries to Communist rule and Soviet economic exploitation will
                                eventually win them freedom and the strength of this opposition at
                                home and in exile will not be affected by this temporary
                                representation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> through
                                alien regimes.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, it is not too much to urge that as part performance of the
                                obligations which the satellite governments will undertake as <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members, they will do away with iron
                                curtains and other barriers to normal decent relations with other
                                nations.</p>
                            <p>For all these reasons, the United States intends to vote for the
                                admission of the thirteen and to refrain from voting against the
                                four mentioned above.</p>
                            <p>Our warm and friendly feelings for the Republic of Korea and the
                                Republic of South Vietnam whose allies and supporters we are, is
                                well known. Because their territory is unfortunately divided, they
                                are not now being presented for membership.</p>

                            elaboration my views as President and I seem to be seeing alike on this
                            situation. While I realize there are disadvantages in letting any of
                            satellites in I think these disadvantages can be reasonably minimized
                            and that balance will be in our favor. I believe we cannot without very
                            great loss indeed be the nation which adheres to an interpretation of
                            Article 4 which would result in excluding of seven countries recommended
                            by Bandung Conference, including Japan, and which would in such
                            predominantly <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> Catholic
                            countries as Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Austria shift to US,
                            rightly or wrongly, the responsibility for their exclusion. This could
                            have very serious consequences particularly in Italy. Also the
                            consequences upon our Latin American relations would I suspect be
                            considerable.</p>
                        <p>It is to be recalled that our peace treaties with Rumania, Hungary and
                            Bulgaria in effect commit us to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            membership. In connection with above the position of France in Security
                            Council has not been clarified. They may be reluctant to waive veto to
                            permit universality which they believe would further increase
                            anti-colonial element. However, I believe France will not stand alone
                            against the clear will of the great majority including UK.</p>

                                    >Eisenhower</persName> delegate in Nebraska. His reaction was
                                that a few hardheads wouldn’t like it “but that it would help us a
                                lot around election time.” This is significant coming from Omaha.
                                The other man, whom I am sure you know, is Barak Mattingly of St

                            would appreciate your comments soonest:</p>
                        <p>“1. In his speech at the opening of the General Assembly on September
                            22nd, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            pointed out ’that our organization’s power derives largely from moral
                            judgments formed here’ and that, therefore, it is essential ‘that there
                            should be here all of those eligible nations which, by their policies
                            and conduct, have demonstrated their devotion to the purposes and
                            principles of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter’.</p>
                        <p>2. He said further that ’about a score of sovereign nations are not
                            represented here and many of them meet the membership tests of our
                            Charter. They are peace-loving and they have shown themselves able and
                            willing to carry out the Charter’s obligations. Their governments would
                            reflect here important segments of world opinion. To block the admission
                            of such nations by use of the veto power is a grave wrong, not only
                            [to]them, but it is also a wrong to this organization and to all of its
                            members. I hope that during this Tenth Session action will be taken by
                            the Security Council and by the General Assembly to bring these nations
                            into our membership. Thus, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would
                            enter its second decade better equipped to serve mankind.’</p>
                        <p>3. Twelve of the thirteen deserving and qualified nations have been
                            blocked from admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> because
                            of Soviet Russia’s abuse of the veto power in the Security Council. The
                            Security Council has not as yet acted on the application of Spain.</p>
                        <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0362"/>
                        <p>4. In the European area, the list of applicants includes Italy, Austria,
                            Finland, Eire, Portugal, and Spain.</p>
                        <p>5. In the Near and Far East, it includes Cambodia, Ceylon, Japan, Jordan,
                            Laos, Libya, and Nepal. These were specifically endorsed for membership
                            by the Bandung Conference of last spring.</p>
                        <p>6. It is reported that the Soviet Union will withhold its veto and that
                            these free nations can become members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> if the free world is willing not to block the admission
                            of governments behind the so-called ’iron curtain’—governments which are
                            not equals among equals as are the nations of the free world, but are in
                            a subordinate relationship to Moscow. This means Albania, Bulgaria,
                            Hungary, and Rumania.</p>
                        <p>7. Not to prevent the entrance of such governments into the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does not mean approval of their systems
                            of government nor a condoning of the violations of human rights in which
                            these governments have persistently engaged.</p>
                        <p>8. But there is an overriding reason which, after mature consideration,
                            seems to us to outweigh this drawback. It is that the admission of these
                            13 free nations would add so tremendously to the moral weight of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as overwhelmingly to outweigh the
                            admission of the 4.</p>
                        <p>9. There is also reason to hope that membership in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will to some extent bring the people of
                            Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania closer to freedom.</p>
                        <p>10. For these reasons, the US intends to vote for the admission of the 13
                            and to abstain on the 4 mentioned above.”</p>
                        <p>I will undoubtedly get a question at the press conference, after having
                            released my statement, regarding Chinese representation. While not
                            including reference to this question in my prepared statement above, I
                            propose to answer such query along following lines:</p>
                        <p>“11. To avoid any possible misunderstanding, I point out that the
                            question of new members is totally distinct from the demand of the
                            Chinese Communists to represent China, which is already a member.</p>
                        <p>In American political language, the matter raised by the Chinese
                            Communists is a credentials question and not a membership question. The
                            only connection would be that the added moral weight which these 13
                            would bring would mean more support for the United States on many
                            issues, including the type of motion we have made in the past in the
                            United Nations against the seating of the Chinese Communists.”</p>
                        <p>I have noted your suggestion that reference to divided countries be
                            omitted from my prepared statement because of difficulties of treating
                            with Federal Republic of Germany. As you are aware, North and South
                            Vietnam and North and South Korea have applied for membership, <pb
                                n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0363"/>whereas Federal Republic of
                            Germany has not. I am not aware of any intention on its part to make
                            application until it is unified. Even if there is no reference to
                            divided states in my prepared statement, I will surely be asked at press
                            conference what US attitude is regarding applications of divided
                            countries. Would appreciate your suggestions as to what I might say in
                            response such press query.</p>

                            tactical question of an approach to the French and the Russians on the
                            veto matter, outlining our preoccupation that without assurance on the
                            veto matter we might be placed in a most awkward position if the public
                            statement is made. The result could conceivably be that in the end we
                            would fail in our objective to obtain the admission of the 13 friendly
                            countries, having, however, publicly surrendered the principle on which
                            we have stood heretofore. It was assumed by <gloss target="#t_Dept1"
                                >Dept</gloss> that Soviet assurance on the veto was a condition
                            precedent to application of the present membership plan. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot</persName> seems to believe that an
                            approach to the Russians now on the veto matter would not be fruitful
                            and is inclined to proceed with the public statement in the absence of a
                            Russian assurance. He states the opinion that we could win out in the

                                generally.” The revision reads as follows: “It has been reported
                                that the Soviet Union would be willing to withhold its veto and
                                accept these free nations as members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                                world, but are in a subordinate relationship to Moscow. Since Outer
                                Mongolia would obviously be generally unacceptable, this would mean
                                Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Rumania.” (Department of State,

                                        plan” is quite correct. But publicity is not the same thing
                                        as application. Release of the statement is one phase in
                                        getting to a point where the present membership plan can be
                                        applied. This is a very different matter.</item>

                        <p>428. Foreign Office view of package proposal for new membership in <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is that it is fundamentally same as
                            Russian proposal in ninth <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> which was
                            rejected. Because of increase number of non-communist applicants in the
                            new proposal, it looks more favorable, but attitude of Chinese
                            Government still is that acceptance of package deal is (1) contrary to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> previous stand, and (2) violation
                            of the charter to accept new members except on merit. Foreign Office
                            stated <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> delegation would oppose
                            package deal and expressed hope US Government would do likewise.

                                of opinion, since Canadians have undertaken their steps on
                                membership, that has had a persuasive effect upon some governments,

                                we should go to Security Council first. It would give us greater

                                would be more difficult for us if we proceed in <gloss

                                undoubtedly press for Outer Mongolia and Soviets would have to give
                                support for such a move. This could upset any agreement which might
                                be arrived at on Security Council action regarding 17.</item>

                                    target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> first largely motivated by desire

                            <item>There was also brief discussion with respect to position of
                                France. <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> pointed out
                                that there were two things being whispered in corridors: first, that
                                nothing would move the French until Algerian question was settled,
                                which in turn would pave the way to a more moderate French attitude
                                on membership question; secondly, it was also being whispered if
                                French would give undertaking on new members this would lead Arabs
                                to be helpful on Algerian matter. <persName>Martin</persName> said
                                that while French have not concurred, they have not said no. He
                                expressed view that France would not stand against US and UK
                                position in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, and he added it is a
                                chance we have to take. <persName>Martin</persName> also expressed
                                his belief that the Russians are prepared “to go a long way,” and he
                                added that he did not believe that there was need for assurance from

                                <item>There is much feeling that, notwithstanding good reasons
                                    advanced to the contrary, the adoption by the US of the policy
                                    of universality will open the way for the eventual membership of
                                    Communist China. While it is doubtful if we should attempt to
                                    line up support now for opposition in future years, I strongly
                                    recommend that we include a strong statement regarding Communist
                                    China at the time our proposal is made public.</item>

                                            rend="blockquote">
                                            <p>“I recall from the days at San Francisco in 1945,
                                                when the Charter was drawn, that there was at that
                                                time a very considerable argument on whether the
                                                United Nations should be a universal body which
                                                would represent all the governments of the world,
                                                good, bad, or indifferent, or whether membership
                                                should be on a selective basis. That was strongly
                                                argued at San Francisco and the proponents of
                                                selectivity won. That is reflected by the provision
                                                in the Charter that members should be peace-loving
                                                and able and willing to discharge their obligations
                                                under the Charter. That is strengthened furthermore
                                                by the provision that any nation against which
                                                enforcement action was taken should be liable to
                                                suspension from membership in the United Nations. In
                                                other words, the United Nations was not set up to be
                                                a reformatory. It was assumed that you would be good
                                                before you got in and not that being in would make
                                                you good.”</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. Macmillan raised the question of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> membership. He said the Canadians wanted to table their
                            proposals. He said that the Russians were backing Outer Mongolia and he
                            thought that they might try to bargain for its admission against some
                            other nation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was strongly against the admission of Outer
                            Mongolia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> was coming
                            to see him Sunday morning at 10 o’clock and, from something Gromyko had
                            said to him, he thought that his call might have something to do with
                            the <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0374"/><gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> membership question. The Secretary then asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DM1">de Margerie</persName> what the French
                            position was with regard to the Canadian proposal for the admission of
                            eighteen countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">de Margerie</persName> said that at
                            present the French Government does not feel that it can be a party to
                            the discussions on this subject. If the Latin American motion were voted
                            by the General Assembly, whereby the Algerian item would be removed from
                            the agenda, the French Government would return to the General Assembly.
                            Otherwise, it would not be part of it. He said that the French were
                            somewhat unhappy at the prospect of the admission to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> of several countries of the Bandung
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that the question of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> membership was principally a matter which concerned the
                            Security Council and not the Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">de Margerie</persName> said that at
                            present there was no official French position on the membership
                            question, and that Mr. Pinay had instructed Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> to keep hands off.</p>
                        <p>There followed a discussion of the procedures under the Charter of the
                            United Nations for admission of new members, and the Secretary observed
                            that the Security Council has to recommend the States involved to the
                            General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Outer Mongolia was not a genuine state. Admission
                            of Outer Mongolia would give the Soviet Union four votes instead of the
                            three it now has. It would be more appropriate, he said, to trade off
                            Outer Mongolia against the Ukraine or Byelo-Russia. Mr. Macmillan
                            observed that the Russians might be tempted to veto Spain if we don’t
                            admit Outer Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>In answer to a question from the Secretary, Mr. Macmillan said that the
                            UK Government is known to be a supporter of the Canadian proposal, and
                            if the Canadians table it, the UK will have to vote in favor of it
                            because of the candidacy of their staunch and faithful Commonwealth
                            ally, Ceylon.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered how the Canadians had reached the number of
                            eighteen and Mr. Macmillan said that they had simply taken a list of all
                            the candidates. The Secretary said that Puerto Rico would be as good a
                            candidate as Outer Mongolia; in fact, why should he not propose Duck
                            Island?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that the Canadian proposal meant a kind of de
                            facto amendment of the Charter with regard to its provision for
                            conditions of membership. He said that it had been regrettable that the
                            Ukraine and Byelo-Russia had been allowed to slip in at the
                            beginning.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">de Margerie</persName> said that he could
                            speak for Mr. Pinay to the effect that if the Algerian question were
                            settled before the Canadian <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0375"
                            />proposal came up for a vote, he thought that France would go along
                            with it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Macmillan said that if it were a question of nothing at all or
                            admitting the eighteen countries, the Government of the United Kingdom
                            would take the whole lot, including Outer Mongolia, though it, did not
                            like it. He observed further that the admission of all these countries
                            would mean that a whole lot of new issues would be introduced for
                            debate, especially with the presence of Ireland in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Secretary observed that no doubt the
                            question of the partition of Ireland would come up and Mr. Macmillan
                            ruefully agreed.</p>
                        <p>No more subjects were proposed for discussion at this meeting and it was
                            agreed that the press would be told that the three Ministers had met in
                            order to have an exchange of views on matters outside the scope of the
                            Conference of Foreign Ministers. It was subsequently discovered that Sir

                                </list></item>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>, at his request, came
                            to see the Secretary this morning to discuss, inter alia, the problem of
                            membership in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> started the
                            conversation saying that it would be useful to exchange views on the
                            membership question. The Secretary also thought it would be useful to
                            exchange views. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> asked
                            whether there was hope of settling the matter in the General Assembly.
                            The Secretary replied that that depends on what we and other concerned
                            countries agree on and asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> thought it could be settled.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added that the United States would forego the veto in the
                            Security Council and had gathered that that might be satisfactory to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> thought that the matter was on
                            a different plane and stated that we ought to see what can be done
                            concretely. He referred to a conversation he had with the Ambassador of
                            Ceylon. He said that as far as the Canadian proposal is concerned, there
                            is a majority in the United Nations in favor of it and explained what
                            that majority consists of–the Latin Americans, the countries of Asia and
                            Africa as well as the majority of Europeans. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> was certain that the United
                            States was aware of the positions of these countries. He went on to say
                            that the USSR has certain reservations regarding Japan and that the
                            United States was aware of the USSR attitude toward Spain, but he felt,
                            nevertheless <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0378"/>less, that it was
                            possible to find a solution on this between the United States and the
                            USSR. The Secretary stated that the United States also has reservations
                            about certain countries and asked whether Outer Mongolia is on the
                            Canadian list. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said
                            that it is and the Secretary said that he did not consider Outer
                            Mongolia an independent state and had great reservations regarding
                            Albania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Rumania. The Secretary suggested that if
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> would drop his two
                            reservations, we might find a way to drop ours regarding the satellites.
                            He was not prepared, however, to accept Outer Mongolia. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> replied that he thought we
                            should find a common decision which would be acceptable to the United
                            Nations as a whole, and that we should recognize that the Canadian
                            proposal is acceptable as it stands. He appreciated that there would be
                            absentions on the part of certain countries.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that there are other countries besides the United
                            States and the USSR, which have the veto in the Security Council. The
                            Secretary then went on to say that a general agreement could presumably
                            be found on certain European countries: Italy, Austria, Portugal,
                            Ireland, and Finland. This sets aside Spain because of the USSR
                            objection. We could also accept the Bandung seven states which did not
                            recommend Outer Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> restated his position
                            on Spain and Japan and contended that he would not differentiate between
                            the treaty countries. For that reason, he felt, it would be more
                            advisable to seek agreement on the Canadian proposal of 18 or the
                            earlier Canadian proposal of 17 which was minus Spain. He said he was
                            prepared to come to an agreement on either of these two Canadian
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would be prepared to make some concession to
                            reflect the Soviet objections to Spain and Japan, but we could not agree
                            to accept Outer Mongolia and Albania. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> replied that it is difficult not to recognize
                            Albania as a state since it has existed for a long time and is referred
                            to in the Italian peace treaty. It would also be difficult to deny the
                            existence of Outer Mongolia which has diplomatic relations with a number
                            of countries and which has recently established relations with India. In
                            making concessions on Spain and Japan, the Soviet Union feels that the
                            matter should be settled simultaneously. This view, he stated, is shared
                            by the overwhelming majority in the United Nations. The Secretary
                            commented that he didn’t feel that there is an overwhelming desire in
                            the United Nations for Albania, Outer Mongolia, etc., and if the matter
                            were put to a vote those applicants would be defeated, whereas if all
                            the other applicants were put to a vote they would not be. If there is
                            any doubt on this, the Secretary said, we could put them up one by one,
                            to see what the outcome would be.</p>
                        <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0379"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said that in the peace
                            treaties we undertook to support these states for United Nations
                            membership and he felt that the signatures to those treaties were worth
                            something. The sentiment in New York, as he understood it, is quite
                            definitely that a majority of the United Nations members is in favor of
                            simultaneous admission. The Secretary again pointed out that the Soviet
                            Union knows the United States views on the satellite nations. The views
                            of the United States were expressed by the President here in Geneva at
                            the Summit Conference and in his speech of August 25. In view of our
                            well-known position regarding the satellites it is difficult for the
                            United States to accept these nations into the United Nations. The
                            Secretary went on to say that no one will want to raise any objections
                            to the Bandung states. In view of the general approval by the Bandung
                            Conference of these seven, we, of course, would not want to disapprove.
                            However, the Bandung Conference left out Outer Mongolia and if the
                            African-Asian states did not consider Outer Mongolia deserving of
                            membership it is hardly expected that we should. In Europe, there are
                            five to whom we cannot find any objection–Italy, Portugal, Ireland,
                            Austria, and Finland. Finland is friendly and close to the Soviet Union;
                            Ireland is strongly anti-UK; Austria is neutral. That leaves for
                            discussion Spain, Hungary, Rumania, Albania, and Bulgaria. The Secretary
                            expressed a willingness to discuss this group in the hope of reaching
                            some agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> responded by saying
                            that it is true that Outer Mongolia was not mentioned in the Bandung
                            list. The reason is it was not represented there. We cannot, he said,
                            accept the accusations levelled against the other four in Europe. The
                            peace treaties were concluded with them and signed by the United States.
                            In the treaty with Italy special mention is made of the rights of
                            Albania. We, he said, attach importance to these treaties, and we cannot
                            differentiate these treaties from those with Italy and Austria.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United States could not accept Outer
                            Mongolia, and as far as Europe is concerned, we cannot disagree
                            concerning the five he first mentioned. He is prepared to negotiate on
                            Spain and the four satellites. It is against our principles, he said, to
                            admit the four satellites to the United Nations. He was prepared to take
                            two satellites, any of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName>’s choosing, if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> would take Spain. One, he said, should be
                            sufficient in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s eyes
                            to match Spain, but he was prepared to take two. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said the best way to settle
                            this matter simply and clearly, bearing in mind the overwhelming
                            sentiment in the United Nations for the Canadian proposal of 18, is to
                            agree on that proposal. He felt that we could find a way to overcome
                            these difficulties in order to meet the desire of the United Nations
                            members. Otherwise, he was afraid that we are not placing ourselves <pb
                                n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0380"/>in a good position before world
                            public opinion in holding up agreement on a situation which is ripe for
                            settlement. It would hardly be understandable to raise objections to
                            some special countries if public opinion would not understand it. This
                            is true with respect to Outer Mongolia and Spain. He thought that there
                            was a good basis for settlement on the Canadian proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> wants Outer Mongolia, he doubted we could reach
                            an agreement. He was willing to take the Bandung seven and negotiate on
                            the European countries but he repeated that there could not be a package
                            settlement with Outer Mongolia in it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> said it is impossible for the Soviet Union to
                            segregate the 18 into acceptable and non-acceptable countries. We regard
                            the list, he said, as an acceptable basis for agreement. Outer Mongolia
                            was not on the Bandung list because it was not at that conference.
                            Israel however was not represented there either.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that Israel’s absence from Bandung is quite
                            different. It is not recognized by any Arab country just as Outer
                            Mongolia is not generally recognized.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> restated the USSR view
                            is to accept the suggestion of an American neighbor, Canada. He didn’t
                            think Canada had wanted to harm the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Canada is a good neighbor but the United States
                            does not always agree with Canada. In this case, said <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>, we could achieve good results
                            on the basis of your good friend and neighbor. The Secretary said we
                            have already considered this and strongly urged <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> that Outer Mongolia be excluded
                            from the list. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                            replied it would be difficult and impossible to divide the list and
                            discriminate on Outer Mongolia. That in turn would raise the question of
                            Spain and would hold up the settlement. The Secretary recognized that an
                            agreement would be difficult for the USSR but it would be just as
                            difficult for us. There is a difference between difficulty and
                            impossibility. If one uses the word impossible, then there is little
                            room for negotiation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                            replied that difficulties and impossibilities regarding Outer Mongolia
                            are the same as those regarding Spain. The Secretary replied that we
                            have the same problem with the four satellites. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said that this was the reason
                            he was suggesting that there not be a one-sided approach and that we
                            take the Canadian proposal in toto—one supported by an overwhelming
                            number in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United States was anxious to try to settle
                            this question in considerable part at least at this time. We were
                            willing to make sacrifices and if the Canadian proposal is the only
                            basis then he thought there was not much to discuss here.</p>
                        <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0381"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said, there are in
                            fact two Canadian proposals: one dealing with 17 applicants and one
                            dealing with 18. The USSR is prepared to support either of these.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that the United States was not prepared to take
                            either of the Canadian proposals. He said that there is a large area of
                            agreement and that it would be generally helpful in relaxing of tensions
                            to solve the membership problem. He stated that we were not consulted on
                            the Canadian proposals and the issue is on what applicants we can have
                            an agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said that the USSR
                            also views the matter from the standpoint of relaxation of tension and

                            he is adamant on Canadian 18-state admission program and said it would
                            be “impossible” for Soviet Union to consider any program which did not
                            include Outer Mongolia. I indicated acceptability of Bandung group and
                            negotiability of Soviet Union European satellites but he did not
                            respond.</p>
                        <p>Under circumstances believe that unless we are prepared to accept onus of
                            rejecting any package proposal we should quickly get out our own
                            17-power proposal and try to rally enough support for it to nullify

                        <p><gloss target="#t_DelgaDelGA1">Delga</gloss> 279. Re: Membership. I made
                            following statement at press conference held Sunday, 4:30 p.m. at US
                            Mission:</p>
                        <p>“In his speech at the opening of the General Assembly on September 22nd,
                            Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed
                            out ‘that our organization’s power derives largely from moral judgments
                            formed here’ and that, therefore, it is essential ‘that there should be
                            here all of those eligible nations which, by their policies and conduct,
                            have demonstrated their devotion to the purposes and principles of the
                            United Nations Charter’. He pointed out that ‘about a score of sovereign
                            nations are not represented here and many of them meet the membership
                            tests of our Charter. They are peace-loving and they have shown
                            themselves able and willing to carry out the Charter’s obligations.
                            Their governments would reflect here important segments of world
                            opinion. To block the admission of such nations by use of the veto power
                            is a grave wrong, not only to them, but it is also a wrong to this
                            organization and to all of its members. I hope that during this Tenth
                            Session action will be taken by the Security Council and by the General
                            Assembly to bring these nations into our membership. Thus, the United
                            Nations would enter its second decade better equipped to serve
                            mankind’.</p>
                        <p>A large number of deserving and qualified nations have been blocked from
                            admission to the United Nations because of the Soviet Union’s abuse of
                            the veto power in the Security Council. Among these nations, in the
                            European area, are Italy, Austria, Finland, Eire, and Portugal. The
                            Security Council has not as yet taken up the application of Spain, which
                            is also a deserving and qualified nation.</p>
                        <p>In the Near and Far East, the number of deserving and qualified nations
                            includes seven countries specifically endorsed for immediate <pb n="357"
                                xml:id="pg_357" facs="0383"/>United Nations membership by the
                            Bandung Conference of last spring: Cambodia, Ceylon, Japan, Jordan,
                            Laos, Libya, and Nepal.</p>
                        <p>It has been reported that the Soviet Union would be willing to withhold
                            its veto and accept these free nations as members of the United Nations
                            if the free world is willing to accept the admission of nations behind
                            the so-called Iron Curtain nations whose governments are not equals
                            among equals as are nations of the free world, but are in a subordinate
                            relationship to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>To refrain from preventing the entrance of satellites into the United
                            Nations does not mean approval of their present systems of government
                            nor does it condone the violations of human rights in which these
                            governments have persistently engaged.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, there is reason to hope that membership in the United Nations
                            will to some extent bring the peoples of these countries closer to
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>The over-riding fact is that the admission of 13 free nations greatly
                            outweighs whatever drawbacks there may be in the admission of the others
                            because the 13 nations would add so tremendously to the moral weight of
                            the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons, the United States intends to vote for the admission of
                            the 13 and to abstain on the others. Our abstention in the Security
                            Council on the applications of satellites is consistent with our
                            national policy, as expressed in the <persName corresp="#p_VAH1"
                                >Vandenberg</persName> resolution of 1948 (80th Congress), which
                            called for voluntary agreement among the permanent members of the
                            Security Council to remove the veto from the admission of new members.
                            This proposal covers 17 new members, 13 of whom we favor. The satellites
                            would include Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Rumania, since it is
                            obvious that Outer Mongolia can not make the grade.”</p>
                        <p>In response to planned inquiry, I made following statement concerning
                            question of Chinese representation:</p>
                        <p>“To avoid any possible misunderstanding, I pointed out that the question
                            of new members is totally distinct from the demand of the Chinese
                            Communists to represent China, which is already a member. In American
                            political language, the matter raised by the Chinese communists is not a
                            question of membership, but a question of what delegates from what
                            governments are entitled to represent a country which, from the
                            beginning of the United Nations, has been an acknowledged member. The
                            only connection between the proposed new members and representation of
                            China by the Communists would be that the added moral weight of the new
                            members would mean more support for the United States on many issues
                            (even after deducting the votes of the satellites), including our
                            opposition to seating the Chinese Communists.”</p>
                        <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0384"/>
                        <p>In addition, in order to help prepare groundwork for important role we
                            expect <persName corresp="#p_BVA1">Belaunde</persName> (Peru) to play on
                            this question, I paid tribute to his efforts as Good Offices Committee
                            chairman.</p>
                        <p>I also praised Canadian government for efforts made up to this point in
                            keeping membership question alive. I also took opportunity to make
                            reference to Kossuth, reference to which was included in additional

                                    He said he intended tell Soviets that Outer Mongolia was
                                    impossible for US and that Soviets would take on heavy
                                    responsibility if they wrecked chances of getting new members in
                                    by insistence on Outer Mongolia. He also said he would tell
                                        <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> that US was not
                                    only one against Outer Mongolia. Others were opposed not only to
                                    Outer Mongolia, but also to the four Eastern European
                                    satellites. He would say to Soviets that if they drop their
                                    insistence on Outer Mongolia, he, and perhaps US, might be in
                                    position to help with getting four <gloss target="#t_EE1"

                        </list>
                        <p>Late Sunday morning the Secretary cabled that we should proceed to
                            release quickly our position on the question of admitting new members to
                            the United Nations. As a result of this wire, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> announced that he would hold a
                            press conference at 4:30 pm. In the circumstances we felt it necessary
                            to call Congressional leaders in order to let them know what our plans
                            were and to give them background information on the problem.</p>
                        <p>As a result of my conversations with eleven members of the Congress, it
                            appears that ten were in favor of our proposal and that only one,
                            Congressman Vorys of Ohio,<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">John M. Vorys,
                                Republican.</note> had strong reservations. Most of them opposed the
                            admission of Outer Mongolia (if that could be done without destroying
                            the package deal) and nearly all of them expressed the hope that the
                            admission of new members would not jeopardize our policy with respect to
                            the seating of Communist China.</p>
                        <p>In brief, the reaction of the members contacted was as follows:</p>

                        <p>Mr. Rayburn said that if the Secretary thinks it is necessary to take
                            this step, then he would go along with it.</p>

                                xml:id="d163fn4">James P. Richards, Democrat.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. Richards stated that while he did not like the satellites he would go
                            along with the idea on the ground that it would help us more than it
                            would hurt us; that it would in general improve the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He recalled the pressure that existed in
                            New York when he was on the delegation and said he thought we would
                            probably have to do something like this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Vorys</hi>–(Ohio)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vorys commented that he had been willing for some time to accept the
                            principle of universality in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. On
                            the other hand he did not like Outer Mongolia and he was not sure that
                            this was a good bargain from our point of view. He said that on further
                            reflection he might reconsider but his attitude was somewhat
                            unfavorable.</p>

                            along with the idea but that he raised two questions. He asked whether
                            we would abstain in principle in the Security Council or whether our
                            abstention would be just for this particular package deal. In other
                            words, he did not wish to give away our veto in the future when we might
                            want to keep out certain undesirable states. He also raised the question
                            of South Korea and said that he hoped some statement would be made about
                            our concern over that divided country.</p>

                        <p>Senator <persName>George</persName> believed that on balance it was a
                            wise thing to do. He underlined the fact that we should not leave the
                            impression that this would pave the way for the seating of Communist
                            China and he pointed out that he did not like Outer Mongolia, but he
                            realized that the pressure of public opinion was such that our change in
                            policy seemed justifiable.</p>

                        <p>Senator Wiley understood the problem quite well since he had handled the
                            membership problem when he attended the General Assembly three years
                            ago. He has not been in favor of admitting the satellite states but
                            supposed that the situation had developed to the point where it might
                            now be the least objectionable of the two courses open to us. He
                            indicated that he would go along with the idea if the Secretary felt it
                            desirable.</p>

                        <p>Senator Hickenlooper said that he would be greatly swayed by the
                            Secretary’s judgment in this matter. He thought on balance that we would
                            get more out of it than we would lose although he hated to see the
                            satellite states come into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He
                            expressed some concern over the German situation although he realized
                            that a divided country constituted a separate problem. He said that he
                            would be glad to go along with the idea which he characterized as “on
                            the plus rather than the minus side”.</p>

                        <p>I called Senator Green and left a message for him but he was not
                            available.</p>

                        <p>Senator Smith stated that he had wondered for some time whether our
                            policy with respect to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership was
                            sound and he believed that on the whole our change was the proper thing
                            to do. As in the case of most members, he wanted to make clear his
                            opposition to the seating of Communist China. He also recalled his
                            experience at the General Assembly last year and recognized the fact
                            that it would not be possible for us to withstand the pressure of public
                            opinion in this regard much longer.</p>

                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> stated that on
                            balance the proposal seemed to be a reasonable one. He believed that the
                            U.S. is on the spot for keeping out the countries that now seek
                            admission and that the U.S. should not be a road-block in this respect.
                            He pointed out that basically he favored the idea of universality and
                            that this would be a step in that direction.</p>

                            favored the idea and said that he would be glad to comment favorably on
                            it to the press if that would be helpful. He thought it would increase
                            the voting strength on our side in the General Assembly and that the
                            admission of these states would be something of a counterpoise to the
                            Afro-Asian bloc.</p>

                        <p>Senator Aiken believed it was a desirable step for us to take because of
                            all of the nations which have desired admission. He felt it would be
                            unwise for us to continue to prevent their admission even though that
                            would result in letting in some undesirables.</p>

                            night, Tuesday,<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">November 15.</note> after
                            the meeting of the 22 countries who are interested in membership,
                                <persName>Martin</persName> of Canada called me but we did not
                            connect. When I returned his call this morning he made roughly the
                            following declaration:</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I said that I would talk to him after meeting with the Russians and that
                            I thought the realism of the situation was that for reasons with which
                            he, <persName>Martin</persName>, was perfectly familiar, Outer Mongolia
                            could not get through the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. It would
                            not be because of any action of the US either. Therefore, I was going to
                            try to persuade the Russians that if they would drop Outer Mongolia, the
                            US would help get the 17 package deal across, and without voting for the
                            satellites ourselves, would actively try to get the votes for them in
                            the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and would stand by a package
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> report in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. I said that one of the reasons we did
                            not like his plan to take this up in the ad hoc committee was that we
                            were afraid it would generate more pressure for Outer Mongolia, which
                            was like beating your head against a stone wall in view of the reality
                            of the situation, and that instead of trying to whip up sentiment for
                            Outer Mongolia his effort should be directed towards trying to persuade
                            the Russians not to be arbitrary about it.</p>

                        <p><gloss target="#t_DelgaDelGA1">Delga</gloss> 301. Re membership. I
                            informed <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> today at lunch
                            the substance of our position. I said US would not use veto on new
                            members; we would vote for the thirteen and abstain on their five. I
                            stressed that there is real doubt that the satellites would be able to
                            get seven votes in Security Council, and that the doubt was much greater
                            concerning Outer Mongolia. I said that if they would drop Outer
                            Mongolia, the US would help in two ways: 1) to help get votes for the
                            four European satellites; and 2) vote affirmatively on a Security
                            Council report to <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> which would contain
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> recommendation for admission of
                            the group of seventeen. I pointed out that we had reached the phase
                            where action was necessary, that there should be an early meeting of
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, and that we were willing to make
                            such a meeting private.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName>, after emphasizing the
                            tremendous interest among members in finding a solution to the
                            membership problem, agreed that it was necessary for us to come to an
                            agreement. He emphasized their difficulties on Spain. He said the USSR
                            cannot consider anything but an agreement on the eighteen and asked why,
                            if the US is willing to assist with respect to their four, we could not
                            do the same for Outer Mongolia. He asked US assistance in getting the
                            eighteen in, citing the fact that they had made a count with respect to
                            Outer Mongolia and found forty-three in favor.</p>
                        <p>I said they overestimated what we can do; that we may be able to help out
                            by finding seven affirmative votes on the four but that Outer Mongolia
                            just did not have support.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> seemed attracted to the
                            idea of merely taking one vote on a <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            report to <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> when we pointed out that
                            this was a protection for him in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.
                            At same time he suggested that another way in which it might be done
                            would be to convene the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> simultaneously taking the applications
                            one by one on a chronological basis. The <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> would convene, acting first upon Albania, whose
                            application would then move to <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, and
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> would act upon it before <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> proceeded to next application. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName>, however, indicating there
                            might be advantages in a single report requiring one vote only, stopped
                                <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> from pressing this
                            procedure, saying that if we can find agreement, he was sure that we
                            could arrive at a satisfactory procedure to implement it.</p>
                        <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0393"/>
                        <p>I pointed out that it was not at all clear as to what the permanent
                            members would do and that if <persName corresp="#p_KVV1"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName> did not believe this, he should seek to find
                            out for himself. I expressed my feeling that we are not going to get
                            final position from all the members until we have a <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting, preferably a private one.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> suggested a meeting of
                            US, France and UK with a view to ascertaining where the four stand on
                            this matter. I agreed that we could attend such a meeting, but that if
                            such a meeting was called on our initiative I would have to insist on
                            inclusion of the Republic of China. <persName corresp="#p_KVV1"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName> said he understood, and that there was every
                            intention on their part to speak with China, but he preferred to have a
                            meeting of the four in the first instance and would issue the
                            invitations. This meeting is tentatively scheduled for Saturday at
                            Soviet residence.</p>
                        <p>In light of expected meeting on Saturday, we asked whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> agreed that we should not
                            press ahead with the membership item in ad hoc committee. We pointed out
                            that there is a move to bring up this item as quickly as possible in
                            committee. <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> agreed and
                            said that he would speak to <persName>Martin</persName> along these
                            lines.</p>
                        <p>I reported to <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Martin</persName> (Canada) about
                            my conversation with the Soviets. I said that my impression is that a
                            Soviet decision not to stick till the bitter end for Outer Mongolia was
                            by no means out of the question. Concerning a discussion of membership
                            in ad hoc committee, <persName>Martin</persName> said: “I can’t see it
                            being discussed even next week.” I said it was important to keep this
                            whole thing fluid and that there shouldn’t be a commitment of any
                            kind—whether on eighteen or on seventeen. <persName>Martin</persName>
                            agreed that it is advisable to “keep the matter open” and said “if the
                            end result was seventeen we would be happy”. I also reported to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName> and Entezam, President
                            of Council, who agreed to do nothing about a meeting until hearing from
                            me further. I also reported efforts we were making to Erice (Spanish
                            observer).</p>
                        <p>At subsequent meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName>
                            (UK) and <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> (France) I gave
                            them my impression that Soviets will not stick on Outer Mongolia if we
                            continue to take line with Soviets that there is real doubt as to seven
                            votes for their four, that Outer Mongolia just does not have the
                            support, and that we would be willing to help get seven votes on the
                            four satellites if the Soviets are willing to set aside Outer Mongolia.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> said his impression is
                            that the Soviets are making a play on Outer Mongolia as a test of
                            strength. Moreover his impression is also that they are frightened about
                            being tricked on this matter. <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1"
                                >Dixon</persName> said that a meeting of the four is desirable in
                            that it would help to reassure the Soviets.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said that in conversation
                            with <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and Macmillan, Pinay
                            had made it clear that France thought a package deal was bad. <pb
                                n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0394"/>The addition of seven, eight,
                            or eleven votes upsets the General Assembly balance, <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said. He is not at all sure he
                            will be permitted to meet with the Soviets on Saturday since he has no
                            instructions. His Foreign Minister has said that France will not
                            consider membership question before it is back in <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss>, and <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> does
                            not know whether France will be able to accept any group of
                            applicants.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> said that they would like
                            to see admission of seventeen, but if that was not possible, UK would be
                            obliged to favor eighteen. <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName>
                            then went on to express grave concern that we may be confronted
                            eventually with a situation whereby <persName corresp="#p_TTF1"
                                >Tsiang</persName> would veto Outer Mongolia and the entire
                            membership question would fail. A veto by <persName corresp="#p_TTF1"
                                >Tsiang</persName> would be catastrophic according to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName>. There would be a violent
                            reaction against the Chinese for frustrating the general desire on
                            membership and this would likely be used to reopen the Chinese
                            representation issue at this session… .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> interrupted our meeting to
                            see <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Martin</persName> (Canada) to ask him to
                            make two changes in the resolution on the understanding, of course, that
                            there would be no implication that the UK was supporting
                                <persName>Martin</persName>’s initiative. He has suggested the
                            substitution of the phrase “widest possible membership” in the preamble
                            for the word “universality” and the phrase “expanding the membership”
                            for the word “universality” in operative paragraph two.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Following is my evaluation of situation: <list>

                                <item>Worst possibility is that the membership deal will get to a
                                    point where it is finally wrecked by the veto of <persName

                                    allowing for some exaggeration by <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1"
                                        >Dixon</persName>, this would have a violent effect here
                                    with a strong possibility of raising Chinese representation
                                    question this session or at least making our position on this
                                    question more difficult at subsequent sessions. It therefore
                                    should be avoided even if we have to pay the price of not having
                                    any membership deal at this session.</item>

                            they had carefully considered that aspect and had told Chinese they will

                        <p>The dangers inherent in these problems might be minimized and even
                            averted by the following course of action, assuming continued lack of
                            agreement with the USSR that Outer Mongolia may be dropped from the
                            package: one or more members of the Security Council (perhaps preferably
                            seven members, including the US) would introduce a proposal to recommend
                            the 17 for admission. This would be done early enough to give the
                            proposal priority over any others. The US would stand back of this
                            proposal, and make it clear that we proposed to have Outer Mongolia
                            considered separately—on its own, with the US abstaining and not
                            vetoing, and with the US and USSR competing in the open market for votes
                            on Outer Mongolia.</p>

                            would involve us in active support of four satellites (rather than
                            abstention and benign neutrality); however, this distinction would
                            probably not be important to the American public or opinion elsewhere.
                            This course would emphasize the <hi rend="italic">package</hi> character
                            of the whole membership arrangement (in contradistinction to the point
                            we have made that each applicant must be considered on its individual
                            merits; but, here again, the realities are too well known to make a
                            purist position really important for the United States.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Advantages</hi>. The tactics described above would
                            abolish any Soviet fear that the four European satellites would get lost
                            in the shuffle. It would maximize whatever difficulties stand in the way
                            of a French veto; France would be having to veto all 17, including
                            Italy. Admittedly, the tactic would facilitate a Chinese veto of Outer
                            Mongolia by separating out this one applicant. However, the
                            reasonableness and appeal of the US proposal might be sufficient to
                            induce enough abstentions on Outer Mongolia in the Security Council to
                            make a Chinese veto academic and even unnecessary.</p>

                                    Security Council Rules. But such a decision would require seven
                                    affirmative votes (and not merely five abstentions). Also, a
                                    move of this kind could evoke an unfavorable reaction by letting

                                    would not allow the USSR its day in court on Outer Mongolia.
                                    However, the possibility should be kept in reserve, if
                                    postponement appeared more practically possible, vote-wise, than

                            enough votes in the open market. The onus would then be put,

                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador, during a call at his request, stated under
                            instruction his Government’s position on Outer Mongolia’s candidacy for
                            the United Nations.<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">A paraphrase of the
                                instructions sent Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1"
                                    >Koo</persName> by the Government of the Republic of China was
                                transmitted to the Department in telegram 462 from Taipei, November
                                17. This telegram reported that a copy of the instructions to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> were “supplied to
                                Embassy this morning” by the Republic of China. (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >Ibid</hi>., 310.2/11–1755)</note> He said that Outer Mongolia’s
                            independence was a consequence of the Yalta Agreement and of the 1945
                            Sino-Soviet Treaty, with respect to both of which the US had a measure
                            of responsibility. His Government was opposed to the admission of any of
                            the satellites. China would, however, abstain on the four Eastern
                            European satellites if Outer Mongolia were not included in the deal. If,
                            however, Outer Mongolia came up for a vote in the Security Council,
                            China would use its veto if necessary to prevent Outer Mongolia’s
                            admission. In that case, China would also vote against the admission of
                            the four European satellites but would ask that its negative votes not
                            be considered as vetoes. His Government strongly hoped that it could
                            count upon the publicly expressed support of the US Government in this
                            position with respect to Outer Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Robertson, after stating that the US shared China’s views with
                            respect to the satellites, explained the reasons underlying our position
                            on membership along the lines of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName>’s press statement of November 13. He commented
                            that if the four European satellites obtained seven affirmative votes,
                            China’s negative vote would constitute a veto and that in these
                            circumstances China would have to abstain if it were to avoid vetoing
                            the satellites.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether the US would be prepared to support China in
                            vetoing Outer Mongolia. Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> replied that
                            we were opposed to the admission of Outer Mongolia; that we were now
                            doing all that we could in New York to ensure that Outer Mongolia would
                            not be included; and that we found it difficult to believe that Outer
                            Mongolia would have sufficient support to make <pb n="374"
                                xml:id="pg_374" facs="0400"/>the use of the veto a practical
                            question. If Outer Mongolia did not receive the necessary support, we
                            also hesitated to believe that the USSR would stand in the way of the
                            admission of the other applicants but so far the USSR was insistent. The
                            whole membership question was at present under active discussion in New
                            York. Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> continued that he was inclined
                            to believe that the spirit of the <persName corresp="#p_VAH1"
                                >Vandenberg</persName> Resolution would preclude our using the veto
                            on membership. He realized, however, that the question was whether, the
                            Chinese Government having decided to use its veto if necessary to
                            prevent the admission of Outer Mongolia, the US would let China bear the
                            full brunt of world opinion alone. This situation presented serious
                            problems both for China and the US and the matter should be placed
                            before the Secretary after his return. Mr.
                                <persName>Robertson</persName> emphasized that we continued to hope
                            that the use of the veto on Outer Mongolia would not be a practical
                            problem but the possibility could not be entirely ruled out that in
                            certain circumstances we might have to ask the Chinese Government to
                            consider whether it might not abstain rather than veto Outer Mongolia’s
                            application. He added that he hoped that we would not have to make any
                            such request of the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> urged strongly his
                            Government’s hope that whatever course we took we would make clear
                            publicly our opposition to Outer Mongolia and our sympathetic support of
                            the Chinese Government’s position.</p>
                        <p>He then turned to another topic which is reported separately.</p>

                        <p>Certain immediate problems in the membership situation which have
                            tactical consequences for US are: (a) the reported French intention to
                            veto all applicants except Italy, unless the Assembly rules are amended
                            to require a two-thirds vote for inscription of items; (b) the Chinese
                            threat to veto Outer Mongolia, which if carried out, and if it were the
                            last obstacle to Outer Mongolia’s admission, could result in collapse of
                            the whole effort to admit new members—with serious repercussions on the
                            issue of Chinese representation, particularly for the United States; (c)
                            Soviet unwillingness to agree to the dropping of Outer Mongolia, except
                            possibly in return for the rejection of Spain, coupled with the Soviet
                            fear that somehow there will be insufficient votes (particularly in the
                            Security Council) to elect Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Rumania; and
                            (d) the inclination of many <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members to
                            vote for 18 applicants, out of fear that rejecting Outer Mongolia will
                            result in no admission at all, or in the exclusion of Spain.</p>
                        <p>The course of action outlined below can minimize and perhaps even avert
                            the worst dangers inherent in these problems. It aims to save the United
                            States from the charge and onus of preventing a solution of the
                            membership problem and at the same time is an effort to give effect to
                            the position announced in my statement of last Sunday. It would also
                            make clear to the world the arbitrariness and intransigence of Soviet
                            policy in contrast to the reasonableness of our own, and would bring us
                            credit for making possible the entry into the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> of a number of valuable new members, with some of whom
                            we have very close ties and who as you have said would hold the US

                                <item>If, as we must probably anticipate, the resolution on the 17
                                    fails because of the Soviet veto, that a member of the Council
                                    introduce a proposal to recommend 18 countries, including Outer
                                    Mongolia; the United States would make a statement and vote for
                                    this proposal.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The course outlined above obviously entails certain disadvantages. For
                            one thing, in presenting a proposal to admit 17 countries, we would be
                            appearing actively to support 4 satellites, rather than abstaining and
                            remaining benignly neutral. Such a distinction, however, seems not to be
                            real with public opinion. For the United States to introduce a
                            resolution recommending the admission of 17 countries together would
                            emphasize the “package” character of our approach (as against the point
                            we have made since 1946 that each applicant must be considered on its
                            individual merits). But, here again the realities of the situation are
                            pretty well known.</p>
                        <p>Other disadvantages are: difficulties with France and charge that in view
                            of known Soviet attitude on Outer Mongolia we were using membership
                            question as political football in cold war.</p>
                        <p>These drawbacks seem to be outweighed by other considerations.
                            Introduction by the US of a resolution to recommend 17 applicants would
                            abolish any Soviet fear that the 4 European satellites would get lost in
                            the shuffle. It would also maximize whatever difficulties stand in the
                            way of a French veto, since France would be having to veto all 17
                            countries covered by the resolution, including Italy, although she could
                            move to divide. It protects Spain and Japan by preventing these
                            countries from being eliminated in a series of individual votes.</p>
                        <p>By having a vote taken first on the 17, we would compel the Soviet Union
                            to veto them (if the USSR goes through with its threat of a veto) before
                            the fate of Outer Mongolia’s application had been decided. Of course, it
                            might have proven necessary to move and decide that the Council should
                            pronounce itself on Outer Mongolia’s application after the 17 and not
                            before. I am hopeful that 7 votes could be obtained in the Council for
                            reaching a procedural decision that a Soviet amendment on Outer Mongolia
                            should be voted on after the Council’s vote on a resolution recommending
                            17 countries. <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0403"/>If, as we must
                            probably expect, the USSR would veto the 17, there would be no problem
                            in defeating Outer Mongolia on a subsequent vote. The question of a
                            Chinese veto here would be academic.</p>
                        <p>As to the last stage in the course of action outlined above, there might
                            be no occasion for a Council member at that time to introduce a
                            resolution recommending 18 countries including Outer Mongolia; the USSR
                            might already have introduced such a resolution, which under the rules
                            would be voted on after the US resolution to recommend 17. Regardless of
                            the manner in which such a proposal came before the Council, the United
                            States would make a statement attacking the Soviet position, emphasizing
                            the reasonableness of the United States attitude, and pointing to the
                            desirability of admitting to membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> a large number of qualified countries whose entry should
                            no longer be delayed.</p>
                        <p>In the vote on the resolution proposing admission of 18, we would, of
                            course, be faced with the problem of a Chinese veto. However, the
                            Chinese attitude might be a little different on a resolution covering 18
                            countries than on a vote concerned with Outer Mongolia alone, where
                            China has said it will veto (Taipei’s 462<note n="3" xml:id="d169fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d168fn2">footnote 2</ref>, <ref target="#d168"
                                        ><hi rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>.</note>), although she
                            too can move to divide. It would also by that time have been
                            demonstrated to China that we had gone as far as we dared in
                            jeopardizing a solution of the membership problem in trying to prevent
                            Outer Mongolia’s admission. It would be of the greatest importance—and
                            to safeguard the Republic of China’s continued existence—that the
                            contemplated procedure be taken up in advance with the Republic of China
                            urgently on the highest level, with a view to securing Chinese
                            abstention on a resolution covering 18 countries, which would be the
                            very last resort in efforts to break the membership deadlock.</p>
                        <p>If the Soviets introduced a resolution for 18 before we introduced a
                            resolution for 17, we could try to gain the same effects as those
                            described above through the following procedure: <list>

                        <p>The Soviets, particularly for Latin American consumption, have indicated
                            that Spain could not be admitted if Outer Mongolia were not admitted.
                            This may be essentially a device to stimulate Latin votes for Outer
                            Mongolia. It may not represent a serious Soviet proposition to delete
                            Spain in return for the deletion of Outer <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378"
                                facs="0404"/>Mongolia, as the Russians are doubtless aware of the
                            Latin threat to wreck any membership arrangement if Spain is not
                            included.</p>
                        <p>Would like your views just as soon as possible on the above strategy and
                            tactics. In light of <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName>
                            press conference yesterday doubt that it is possible to reach agreement
                            with Soviets on package of 17 even with US introducing and supporting
                            proposal of this sort. For this reason, and because approach to Soviets
                            along this line might only serve to indicate to them that US is
                            over-anxious, I would prefer to move quickly in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> without letting Soviets know what we plan to do. Some
                            confusion for Soviets may result, in which their blackmail, if they
                            stick to it would appear in worst light because they would be vetoing
                            the 17 at a stage when the fate of Outer Mongolia was not certain; US
                            might emerge in not too bad a light. We should not show our hand on last
                            stage of proposal until this was reached in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss>; to do otherwise would obviously undermine earlier phase
                            of operation directed against Outer Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>To sum up: I believe that plan described above is the most auspicious way
                            for extricating ourselves from a very prickly situation. For a Chinese
                            veto to be generally regarded as being the cause of failure to solve the
                            membership deadlock could raise the issue of Chinese representation in a
                            more acute and difficult form than we have ever known. Apart from the
                            very serious impact of such a development on the United States, we must
                            not be held responsible for the failure of a number of free world
                            countries to secure entry to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            There are indications that China is fully aware of the dangers in this
                            situation, and that the Chinese may therefore not wish to carry to its
                            extreme the threatened veto of Outer Mongolia which would jeopardize
                            Republic of China’s whole future status in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. Particularly if the ultimate vote is a single vote on a
                            list of 18, China might be willing to refrain from a veto. I believe it
                            of great importance that our plan for handling the membership situation
                            should be urgently taken up with President Chiang Kai-shek, to persuade
                            him the common interest of our two countries requires us to follow this
                            course.</p>
                        <p>Request authority to introduce 17–nation motion now, so that it will have
                            priority of voting in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. I can later
                            withdraw motion if after further study you deemed it undesirable. I
                            propose public statement somewhat as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The United States is proposing a motion covering 17 nations

                                    we are interested is left behind, and because it prevents any

                        <p>It has become clear that the Chinese Nationalists will definitely veto

                            had explained to him at some length that a veto by them would gravely
                            endanger their whole position here and would make it altogether probable
                            that they would no longer be here next year, he simply said: “That can’t
                            be helped”.</p>

                            <item>If in spite of all our efforts Nationalist China is determined
                                definitely to veto Outer Mongolia, then it seems that we should not
                                have a meeting of the Security Council and should simply try to
                                stall the whole thing along and let it evaporate if possible,
                                difficult though this will be. I was encouraged today at the Soviet
                                lunch to find in response to a question of mine that <persName

                        <p><gloss target="#t_DelgaDelGA1">Delga</gloss> 315. For Secretary and
                                <persName corresp="#p_WDW1">Wainhouse</persName>. I met with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> at latter’s residence before our
                            lunch with Soviets to work out line we would take at luncheon meeting
                            with Soviets.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> mentioned conversation
                            which <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and Macmillan had with
                            Spaak regarding the difficulty that both UK and Belgium have with
                            package idea in general. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1"
                                >Dixon</persName> underscored once again the UK difficulty with
                            Albania and that using this as point of departure he could then
                            emphasize with Soviets that there was real doubt that there would be
                            seven votes for certain of the satellites.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said he would merely state
                            that he had no instructions. …</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that we would state our position, listen to what the
                            Soviets had to say, and if any proposal was made by them that we would
                            merely state that we would consider it rather than agree to it at the
                            luncheon itself. It was also agreed to reconvene at the French residence
                            after the meeting.</p>
                        <p>At lunch <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> opened the
                            discussion by emphasizing, as he had at our lunch last Wednesday, the
                            difficulties the USSR has on the admission of certain states,
                            particularly Spain and Japan. He said he made his position clear at last
                            Thursday’s press conference and that it was 18 or nothing. He stressed
                            that their soundings indicate great pressure for the 18.</p>
                        <p>The line taken by <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> was
                            helpful to us. He said UK could “acquiesce” in the 18, but like all of
                            us they too have difficulties with certain governments. He said UK had
                            great difficulty with the <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0407"
                            />package idea as a whole, particularly in light of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> decision that each applicant should be
                            considered on its merits. Not only was there doubt concerning Outer
                            Mongolia but Albania presented a particular problem for them since it
                            had not abided by the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> decision. UK
                            has serious doubts regarding Albania’s application and is not at all
                            certain there would be sufficient votes to admit it. The realistic fact
                            is, <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> said, there just are
                            not seven votes for some satellites.</p>
                        <p>In a very brief statement <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>
                            said that he had no instructions. He added, however, that he shared
                                <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName>’s views regarding the
                            difficulty of any package deal.</p>
                        <p>I noted that <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> had said
                            that it was not easy for the Soviets to agree to the admission of Spain
                            and Japan. I pointed out our difficulties with regard to the four
                            Eastern European satellites, but despite this we were willing to help
                            find the votes for the four if the Soviets were willing to drop Outer
                            Mongolia. I said the UK and USSR were apparently agreed on the Bandung
                            Powers less Japan and the West European group less Spain and that for
                            them to let in two nations they didn’t like in exchange for four nations
                            we didn’t like was not a bad deal. Once again I said we would be willing
                            to help them get the votes for the four satellites if they would agree
                            to postpone or set aside Outer Mongolia until some future date.</p>
                        <p>Conversation then focused on Outer Mongolia, with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> having difficulty making a
                            case for the independent status of Outer Mongolia. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> argued that the people of
                            Eastern European origin in this country would welcome the entrance of
                            the satellites to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, I disagreed
                            strongly and indicated that the people of Eastern European origin in the
                            U.S. disliked the Communist governments imposed and maintained on these
                            people by force.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> replied that there are
                            positive and negative factors in a deal for each of us and there was a
                            question of balancing one against the other. He then went on to say that
                            the USSR would not “consider” anything other than the 18. He said: “This
                            is strong, definite, and firm”.</p>
                        <p>I said if the Soviet attitude was that they would not even “consider”
                            then we might just as well conclude that we had a pleasant lunch and
                            that there was nothing more to talk about. <persName corresp="#p_KVV1"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName> backed down immediately.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> said it would be nice if 18
                            could get in, but if the USSR attitude was 18 or nothing then there was
                            no basis for discussion. The fact of the matter was that there was real
                            doubt as to the votes on some of the satellites. He said the Soviets
                            were working on a false assumption that votes would be forthcoming.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> was asked by me how he
                            proposed to get the seven votes for the satellites. Only answer he could
                            give was that we must <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0408"/>help him
                            get the seven votes. I pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_KVV1"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName> that he cannot trade what he does not have. He
                            does not have the seven votes, and we would be willing to help him get
                            the seven votes on the four Eastern European countries if he is willing
                            to drop Outer Mongolia. <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName>
                            said if we can agree to help on the 17, why shouldn’t we be able to
                            agree to help on the 18.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to the Canadian proposal with both <persName
                                corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> and me pointing out that it was
                            ambiguous on whether it meant 17 or 18. Both <persName corresp="#p_KVV1"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MYA1"
                                >Malik</persName> said it meant 18. I pointed out that the Soviets
                            must have shared our view that it was ambiguous otherwise they would not
                            have submitted an amendment yesterday listing 18. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> replied to this by saying it
                            was submitted merely to emphasize the sentiment for the 18 and that
                            there was no ambiguity regarding the Canadian proposal.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> suggested it might be
                            desirable to have a non-official Security Council meeting where we would
                            try to find out how the others would vote. He called this a practical
                            approach and suggested that through this process we might ascertain just
                            where we all stand. We said that we would think about this. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAA1">Sobolev</persName> agreed, however, that there
                            should be no Security Council meeting without prior Big Power agreement,
                            saying that if there was no agreement between us then such an exercise
                            would be wasted effort. (They would certainly have pressed for an
                            official <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting if they realized that
                            they could put us in an embarrassing position as a result of Chinese
                            intention to veto Outer Mongolia.)</p>
                        <p>At the end of the luncheon <persName corresp="#p_KVV1"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName> suggested that we should continue our
                            consultations on this matter in order to try to arrive at a
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>We reconvened at the French residence after the luncheon and it was
                            agreed that we would tell the press that no agreement was reached but
                            that consultations are continuing. I shall let them take the
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>I informed <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName>, <persName

                            that I attend an early Latin American caucus to answer questions on the

                                action on ground that a great majority of Latin American nations had
                                already expressed themselves in favor of eighteen nation proposal
                                and there was little left for U.S. to do but go along. In other
                                words, <persName corresp="#p_BVA1">Belaunde</persName> said, “Let
                                the Latin American nations take the rap”. View similar to that
                                stated by <persName corresp="#p_BVA1">Belaunde</persName> was also

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> had asked to see
                            the Secretary, which proved impossible, and then arranged to see Mr.
                                <persName>Robertson</persName> on the urgent instructions of his
                            Government. He gave Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> a Note (copy
                            attached to original only).<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">Not printed; a
                                copy is attached to the source text.</note> The Note stressed the
                            keen interest of the Japanese in early admission to the United Nations
                            and the “honest wish of Japan” that Japanese admission should be
                            effected through the good offices and efforts of the United States
                            rather than those of any other country. It then concluded, “Although
                            Japan fully understands the United States’ position regarding the
                            application of Outer Mongolia, it is desired that the United States will
                            give full regard to the trend of opinion within the United Nations and
                            contribute positively to a favorable settlement of this long pending
                            question.” Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said that we are glad to
                            have the Note, especially since there will be a meeting within the
                            Department later today on the membership problem.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> said that a part
                            of the Japanese interest stemmed from the fact that once Japan is in the
                            United Nations the Soviet Union will lose a bargaining point in the
                            negotiations in London. On the attitude of the Soviet Union he commented
                            that he understood <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> had
                            said publicly at the United Nations that <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385"
                                facs="0411"/>the Soviet Union was ready to approve eighteen
                            countries, which would include Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said that we are not certain of the
                            Soviet position since, to his knowledge, all that they had said is that
                            they would not vote for anyone unless Outer Mongolia is included as
                            well. In addition to this problem with the Soviet Union, the French
                            position is completely unclear. Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName>
                            pointed out that the Soviet Union is equating all of the other seventeen
                            applicants with Outer Mongolia in adopting the position which it is
                            taking. However, he could assure Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1"
                                >Iguchi</persName> that the United States will make every effort for
                            Japanese membership and will not make any arrangement with the Soviet
                            Union which would exclude Japan in favor of some other country or group
                            of countries.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Tan called at Mr. Robertson’s request in the absence from Washington
                            of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName>Robertson</persName> referred to the Ambassador’s call on
                            November 17<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">See <ref target="#d168">Document
                                    168</ref>.</note> during which the Ambassador had stated the
                            Chinese Government’s decision to veto Outer Mongolia’s application for
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership and had requested US
                            support in this position. Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said that
                            we had also received a report of the Chinese Government’s position from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said that he had discussed the Chinese
                            Government’s request with the Secretary who had asked that his views be
                            conveyed at once to the Chinese Ambassador. Mr.
                                <persName>Robertson</persName> reviewed the reasons which had led
                            the Secretary to decide upon the membership position announced by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> on November 13.
                            Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> followed the general lines of
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s press
                            statement of that date but also emphasized the mounting pressures among
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members to find a solution of the
                            membership impasse; referred specifically to the Secretary’s talks in
                            Italy and Spain which had impressed the Secretary with the strength of
                            feeling on the part of these countries over the membership issue;
                            mentioned the restiveness on the part of other qualified candidates
                            against their long continued exclusion from the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>; and pointed out that although this impasse resulted
                            from Soviet vetoes, feeling was also coming to be directed against the
                            US and other permanent members for their failure to find a solution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said that negotiations on the
                            membership question were in progress in New York, that we were doing
                            what we could to prevent Outer Mongolia’s inclusion, but that so far the
                            USSR was insistent on its inclusion. While it was possible that the USSR
                            might not stand in the way of the admission of other applicants if Outer
                            Mongolia were not assured admission or that the necessary votes might
                            not be forthcoming for Outer Mongolia, we <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387"
                                facs="0413"/>had to face the probability that the USSR would remain
                            adamant and that in these circumstances the desire of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members for the admission of qualified
                            candidates might be so great that the needed votes would be provided for
                            Outer Mongolia. He referred to reports from Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> that the Latin American states
                            would almost certainly favor Outer Mongolia rather than permit the
                            membership arrangements to fail over that issue and that the
                            overwhelming majority of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members
                            apparently shared this view. He referred to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_VAH1">Vandenberg</persName> Resolution and said that the
                            US would not use its veto to prevent the admission of Outer Mongolia
                            against the will of the overwhelming majority of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> members.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> continued that if in these
                            circumstances China were to veto the Outer Mongolian application the
                            resentment of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members against China
                            would be so strong that it was to be anticipated that the question of
                            Chinese representation would be reopened, perhaps at once. While we had
                            been successful in maintaining the position on Chinese representation
                            under the moratorium at the beginning of the current General Assembly,
                            he believed that the Chinese Government could foresee what reaction
                            might result if China’s vote had been decisive in blocking the admission
                            of qualified members desired by the great majority of the United
                            Nations. He said he did not believe that he needed to stress the
                            seriousness of this situation. He mentioned that in 1946 China itself
                            had felt constrained to vote for Outer Mongolia just as at a later date
                            the US had felt constrained to abstain on one occasion on Outer
                            Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> concluded by saying that the Secretary
                            felt that he had no alternative but to urge strongly his hope that the
                            Chinese Government would see its way clear to instruct the Chinese
                            Delegation not to use its veto to obstruct a solution of the membership
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Minister Tan said that the Chinese Government felt strongly that it must
                            veto the Outer Mongolian application. He sketched briefly the history of
                            Outer Mongolia’s creation mentioning the Yalta Agreement and the 1945
                            Sino-Soviet Treaty and subsequent Communist aggression against the
                            National Government. He said that President Chiang held strong views on
                            this question as well as <persName>George</persName> Yeh and the
                            Legislative Yuan. He said that he would at once inform Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> in New York of the US
                            position and would also inform Taipei without awaiting the Ambassador’s
                            return.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had already talked with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName> in New York who had
                            informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> of the
                            Chinese Government’s determination to use the veto if necessary to
                            prevent Outer Mongolia’s admission. In view of the seriousness with
                            which we viewed the problem, Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said
                            that the Secretary also intended to send a personal message to President
                            Chiang.</p>

                            Kai-shek from President:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> is cabling you
                                separately<note n="2" xml:id="d176fn2"><hi rend="italic"
                                >Infra</hi>.</note> about the problem of United Nations membership.
                            As you know, there is a proposal to admit 18 nations, including 5 Soviet
                            satellites. Among them is Outer Mongolia. It is painful to contemplate
                            more satellites in the United Nations. But the other side of the picture
                            is that 13 free nations ardently desire admission and that a great
                            majority of the free nations which are now United Nations members feel
                            that it is worth while to pay the price of 5 satellites to get the 13
                            non-satellites.</p>
                        <p>Whatever may be our own national judgment, I feel that we cannot properly
                            interpose a veto to block arbitrarily the will of the great majority. As
                            you doubtless know the United States has never been sympathetic to the
                            use of the veto in membership matters. To use it now would strengthen
                            the Communist cause and do grave damage to our influence in the United
                            Nations. It would not be necessary for you to vote for membership you
                            disapproved of but only to abstain.</p>
                        <p>For our part we do not intend to be in the position of endorsing any of
                            the satellites. We shall, if the procedure permits, abstain from voting
                            on them, if it seems that all of the free countries are going to be
                            admitted.</p>
                        <p>This issue is so important to us both, and could have such far-reaching
                            consequences, that I venture to make this personal appeal that our two
                            countries should not seem divided in this matter.</p>
                        <p>With my warm personal regard, I am,</p>

                            membership problem. In an effort to break the membership deadlock and
                            meet the increasing pressures for the admission of qualified candidates
                            to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> excluded by Soviet vetoes, we
                            announced on November 13 our willingness to refrain from use of the veto
                            on the satellites. This position is in accord with the general spirit of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_VAH1">Vandenberg</persName> Resolution which
                            was overwhelmingly approved by the U.S. Senate in 1948 and which looked
                            toward a general agreement among the permanent members not to use the
                            veto on membership questions. As Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> indicated, we then believed that Outer Mongolia
                            would receive so little support that the question of a veto would not
                            arise.</p>
                        <p>Negotiations on membership are now in progress in New York. While it is
                            possible that the USSR may not stand in the way of the admission of
                            other applicants if Outer Mongolia is not assured admission, or that the
                            necessary votes for its admission may not be forthcoming in the Security
                            Council, our estimate is that the USSR will make the admission of the
                            qualified applicants turn upon admission of Outer Mongolia. In such
                            circumstances we believe that the intense desire of the overwhelming
                            majority of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members for a solution of
                            the membership problem, and specifically for the admission of such
                            candidates as Austria, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ceylon, Ireland, and
                            others, will be so great that the needed votes will probably be
                            forthcoming for Outer Mongolia.</p>
                        <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0416"/>
                        <p>In view of this probability I feel that I must in frankness inform you
                            that in these circumstances the US would not use its veto to stand in
                            the way of the will of the great majority on this issue. If, in this
                            situation, China were to cast a veto, thus preventing the admission of
                            the qualified applicants, the consequences for China’s continued
                            position in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be of the utmost
                            seriousness. While the Chinese representation question was carried
                            successfully at the beginning of this General Assembly under the
                            moratorium arrangement, you can, I believe, foresee the disastrous
                            consequences which might be expected, perhaps at once, if China’s veto
                            were to be decisive to prevent solution of the membership issue when
                            every other Permanent Member will be renouncing its right to veto
                            despite its strong objection to one or more of the candidates.</p>
                        <p>I believe that world opinion will understand and respect the position of
                            our two Governments if, in the interests of the whole, we do not permit
                            the hoped-for goal of admission of 13 qualified applicants to be blocked
                            over Outer Mongolia. Accordingly, I express my strong hope that you will
                            see your way clear to instruct the Chinese Delegation not to employ the
                            veto to obstruct a solution of the membership problem. Your Delegation
                            could, of course, explain its position fully as the US Delegation would
                            also expect to do, so that we would not seem to be giving moral support
                            or approval to these satellites.</p>
                        <p>I am, with best regards,</p>

                        <p>485. President Chiang asked me to see him tonight re Outer Mongolia.
                            Foreign Minister acted as interpreter.</p>
                        <p>Message from Chinese Embassy in Washington leads Chiang to believe US has
                            changed policy re Outer Mongolia. He understood we firmly opposed its
                            admission to <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss>; now we were asking
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0417"/>to abstain in case of vote
                            which probably would result in Outer Mongolia entering <gloss
                                target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            also dislikes idea of European satellites gaining admission but would go
                            along with US in abstaining to that extent. In case of Outer Mongolia
                            however <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> would use every legal means
                            to prevent entry including veto if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Admission of Outer Mongolia would be widely regarded as significant step
                            toward entry of Red China into <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss>,
                            President believes. Moreover, it has none of attributes of sovereignty.
                            Defense and foreign affairs are in Soviet hands; no country of free
                            world has diplomatic relations with Outer Mongolia. Of all Soviet
                            satellites it is most complete puppet. <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> could not sit at table with its representatives and
                            could not justify before own people anything less than strongest
                            opposition to Outer Mongolia’s entry into <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >UNO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>President indicated surprise at mention of <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>’s Y 1945–1946 attitude towards independence and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> membership for Outer Mongolia.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had taken steps most reluctantly at
                            that time because compelled to do so following Yalta. Subsequent actions
                            by Soviets had removed any obligation to continue along same line and
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had abrogated Sino-Soviet Treaty
                            in 1953.</p>
                        <p>Chiang proposed to issue statement on subject and asked my opinion on
                            this and on subject in general. I said clear statement might be useful
                            once <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> definitely decided but that
                            timing important and statement should not be premature. As to US policy
                            I knew of no change as regards Outer Mongolia but supposed we were in
                            embarrassing position because of our desire see such countries as Japan,
                            Spain and Italy gain admission.</p>
                        <p>President asked me transmit his views urgently.</p>
                        <p>In recent conversation Japanese Ambassador told me he understood <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> position that detaching Outer Mongolia
                            was first step in dismemberment of China.<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2"

                            121 to <persName>Martin</persName>. He said that probably the ad hoc
                            committee would not meet until Monday but that in any case the matter
                            was “out of his hands” and was in the hands of the 25 co-sponsors of the
                                <gloss target="#t_res1">res</gloss>. I told him he was the leader. I
                            told him that we were making strenuous efforts in Taipei but that
                            everything I had seen so far was profoundly discouraging and indicated a
                                <gloss target="#t_del1">ChiNat</gloss> veto.</p>
                        <p>I said I presumed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> knew
                            what he was doing in deciding to give this all-out support to Outer
                            Mongolia, but that it was hard for me to contemplate with equanimity the
                            reaction which would follow from a <gloss target="#t_del1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss> veto of the membership deal and the convulsion on
                            Anglo-American relations which would inevitably result, to which no
                            Canadian statesman could, it seemed to me, be indifferent.</p>
                        <p>He implied that the Canadian policy was adopted in response to pressure
                            from India and that it was one in which Australia and New Zealand had
                            joined. I am sure that I shook <persName>Martin</persName> and I
                            observed him in very serious conversation with <persName

                            largely by domestic considerations, he said, particularly reaction in
                            Legislative Yuan. Foreign Minister’s own opposition to Outer Mongolia
                            equally strong on international grounds. In fact would continue oppose
                            even if President Chiang should relent, of which there is no
                            indication.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister admitted Chinese are “emotionally involved” in present
                            case. But he has given it most careful study during past week and is
                            convinced <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> has no alternative but to
                            veto if necessary to keep Outer Mongolia out. At worst, he said, effect

                            trouble.</p>
                        <p>Minister fails to understand how Soviets could be allowed to get away
                            with making entry of free nations contingent upon actual acceptance of
                            Outer Mongolia. <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> was taking no such
                            extreme positions; it was simply opposing the entry of one puppet for
                            which Soviets were applying. Also he could not understand how Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s November 13

                            previously establishing whether Outer Mongolia could in fact “make the
                            grade”. Moreover, he did not believe all was necessarily lost if US made
                            sufficient effort to line up votes; Turkey, Peru and France should be
                            willing to go along with US and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>.</p>

                                letter. After studying all the pros and cons he has decided to
                                recommend that if by abstaining on four European satellites a
                                membership deal could be made, he would abstain on the four
                                satellites but would veto Outer Mongolia. If this is not possible he
                                wants to veto all five communist countries because that would put
                                him on the ‘ground of principle’ whereas vetoing Outer Mongolia
                                alone would appear merely ‘expedient.’ In any event he wants to veto

                            opened the conversation by saying that in the spirit of frankness which
                            characterized Canadian-American relations he wanted the Canadian
                            Government to know that its initiative on the package resolution in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had been damaging to our interests
                            and had not been accompanied by consultation between our two governments
                            of the character called for by the gravity of the proposal. During the
                            conversation the Secretary said that whereas he understood our
                            Delegation in New York had received a copy of the draft resolution a few
                            days earlier, his first knowledge of its text was from a copy given to
                            him by General Franco in Madrid on November 1. He said that the proposal
                            created great problems for us with certain of our allies, and that he
                            foresaw great difficulty in Congress. The admission of Outer Mongolia to
                            the United Nations would, in effect, be the final ratification <pb

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GGPT1">Glazebrook</persName> said that he was
                            disturbed that the Secretary felt the Department had not been adequately
                            consulted. He said that in August he personally, as Chargé, had talked

                                <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> had explained to the
                            External Affairs Committee in Ottawa that he believed all the
                            applications for membership should be considered at the forthcoming
                            General Assembly and that the 4 great powers should get together in an
                            effort to find a solution to the membership question. He said that the
                            Department at that time and in subsequent conversation had explained the
                            extreme difficulty that possible admission of the satellites,
                            particularly Outer Mongolia, would create for the United States. He said
                            that there had also been exchanges in New York between our
                            representatives. The fact was that, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GGPT1"
                                >Glazebrook</persName> said, things began moving extremely rapidly
                            in the General Assembly and that an original proposal that the four
                            great powers reach agreement on this matter had become transformed into
                            a package membership draft resolution.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary repeated in strong terms the serious problems that were
                            created for us. He felt that consultations had not been of a character
                            or at a level which was required by the importance of the issues. He
                            went on to say that at the very least he hoped that the Canadian
                            Government would find it possible to delay a few days in order to enable
                            us to do some of the work which the situation now required.
                                <persName>Martin</persName>, in New York a day or two ago, had said
                            in response to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                            >Lodge</persName>’s request that he refused agree to any delay in
                            presenting the matter and he understood that the resolution was now
                            scheduled for submission on Friday. He doubted that the Canadian
                            Government had thought through all the implications of their action. A
                            possible consequence was the question of the United States even
                            remaining within the United Nations. He said that he had debated and
                            argued with <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> at length on
                            the membership question in Geneva but that his bargaining position had
                            been destroyed by the Canadian initiative. All Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> kept saying was that he was
                            supporting the Canadian resolution for a package of 18 countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GGPT1">Glazebrook</persName> repeated that he
                            believed that the Canadians both in Washington and New York had kept us
                            fully and currently informed of the developments of their thinking. He
                            repeated that the situation had begun to move very fast in the General
                            Assembly. He said that of course he would report the Secretary’s views
                            and the request that there be a delay at least of a few days of the
                            presentation.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary closed the conversation by saying that he had spoken
                            frankly as was customary in our relations with the Canadians.</p>

                            with <persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> (UK) at his request,
                            and in response to his query, I informed him of the substance of the
                            conversation which <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> had
                            with Yeh, pointing out this was an interim reply, and that we have not
                            as yet received a firm reply to our representation at the highest
                            level.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> reported that [name
                            deleted] has instructions giving him discretion on his vote on Outer
                            Mongolia, but he does not wish to be put into a position of casting an
                            abstention which would be the deciding vote.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> agreed with me that if
                                <persName>Martin</persName> does not insist upon interpreting his
                            resolution to mean 18 and is willing to resist the Soviet amendment on
                            the grounds it is not within the spirit of the Canadian proposal, our
                            bargaining power would be improved with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> said it was desirable to
                            have another round with the Soviets—“the earlier the better otherwise it
                            will become obvious to the Russians that the Chinese veto is holding us
                            up.” In the meeting we should try to make it clear that support for
                            Outer Mongolia is not forthcoming, <persName corresp="#p_NA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> said.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> and I
                            would try to meet with <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>
                            today to attempt persuade Canadians to inform Soviets their amendment
                            contrary to spirit of Canadian resolution and to get Canadians to resist
                            Soviet amendment.</p>
                        <p>It was also agreed that we should meet with the Soviets on Monday. (It
                            was not possible by close of work today to meet with <persName
                                corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>.) We believe this would give
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> time to work on this
                            matter. We would let it be known beforehand that there will be another
                            meeting with the Soviets in order to take some of the pressure off
                            moving ahead on Monday in the ad hoc committee. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> said he thought it was important
                            that the consultations <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0424"/>among
                            the Big Four are not left in their present status. He felt that since we
                            had last met with the Soviets at their request, it would be well if we
                            took the initiative and demonstrated our desire to continue to consult
                            on trying to find a solution.</p>
                        <p>Conversation then focused on the Soviet amendment. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> expressed view that we could get
                            a bigger vote against the Soviet amendment as a whole, rather than on
                            individual applicants in a country-by-country vote, because it is
                            clearly a package. I said if the Canadians are willing to resist the
                            Soviet amendment I would see merit in changing our strategy regarding
                            separate votes on individual applicants.</p>
                        <p>I stressed once again the explosive effects in the Atlantic Alliance, and
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> itself, of a Chinese veto about
                            which we are greatly concerned. <persName corresp="#p_NA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> agreed, and at the same time he said he felt it
                            would be difficult to organize abstentions on Outer Mongolia in the
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and negative votes in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. He pointed out, for example, that of the
                            two <gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss>’s on the Council, one is a
                            co-sponsor of the Canadian resolution and the other is chairman of the

                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> he had spoken to <persName
                                corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName> of China and informed him that
                            if China vetoed Outer Mongolia in the Security Council, he himself would
                            move to throw China out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> asked [name deleted]if
                            it would be possible for him to abstain in the voting on Outer Mongolia.
                            He said that, as a co-sponsor of the Canadian resolution, this would not
                            be possible. [Name deleted] attitude seems fairly typical of General
                            Assembly sentiment. It is possible that Chinese activity in various
                            capitals has been designed to elicit reactions; on the other hand, it
                            may indicate a growing and firmer intention to use the veto. It looks
                            more and more to us that a Chinese veto on Outer Mongolia will produce
                            results of untold gravity.</p>
                        <p>If they persist in their intention to veto, we should try to bring about
                            a voting situation in which their veto will not be necessary— and do it,
                            if possible, without having it pinned onto us.</p>
                        <p>On the assumption that there will be enough abstentions to prevent Outer
                            Mongolia from being elected, I still recommend that I be authorized to
                            introduce as I requested on November 18 (<gloss target="#t_DelgaDelGA1"

                            the Security Council for the admission of seventeen nations.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this maneuver would be to have the seventeen-nation motion
                            the first thing on the agenda. It would then be up to the Soviets to
                            move affirmatively to elect Outer Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>Both Belgium and Turkey have flexible instructions which would permit
                            them to abstain. Van Langenhove (Belgium) told me his instructions were
                            to abstain on all five satellites plus Spain. [Name deleted] (Belgium)
                            informed us yesterday that they want to be helpful to US, and, if
                            necessary, they could even vote in favor of Outer Mongolia. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> assured me the French could
                            abstain on Outer Mongolia. New Zealand, however, is non-committal. If
                            Outer Mongolia is not elected, I think it unlikely that the Soviet Union
                            will permit all of our thirteen free nations to be elected if we vote on
                            a country-by-country basis. They are very likely to veto both Spain and
                            Japan, and maybe others, if not all thirteen.</p>
                        <p>If on the other hand, they are confronted by a seventeen-nation motion
                            which they would have to veto en bloc, they would be in a more difficult
                            position.</p>
                        <p>It should be possible to manage matters so that the Soviets would get a
                            very bad press for having vetoed the package deal, however much some
                            governments might blame us. Thereafter we would still be free to accept
                            eighteen nations if we felt it desirable to do so.</p>
                        <p>I realize there are legal objections to a package motion of this kind,
                            but we can get around this by stating that while we are voting on the
                            applicants as a group, nevertheless they have been considered
                            individually. I have discussed this with <persName corresp="#p_MLC1"
                                >Meeker</persName> whom Department should consult upon his return
                            Monday.</p>
                        <p>A further consideration is that neither of the two listings which could
                            be used—either chronological or alphabetical—is satisfactory to us. But
                            all country by country voting is to our disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>Following is text of statement I would make if authorized to introduce
                            this seventeen-nation motion: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“This is a resolution for favorable action on 17 applicants as a

                                    all concerned on this procedure and will take these reactions
                                    very much into account.</p>
                                <p>“The purpose of the resolution is to protect the interests of the

                                    make sure that none of them are left out. It is also proof of
                                    the good faith of the United States in taking the position I
                                    announced. <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0427"/>Furthermore,

                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Following is verbatim text:</p>
                        <p>“I have the pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of your telegraphic
                            message and a separate message from Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, both of which were transmitted
                            to me by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> on
                            November 22. I must thank you for the views you have expressed in the
                            message regarding the admission of new members to the United Nations. I
                            agree with you that the issue is of such importance to both our
                            countries that we should try to avoid division in this matter.</p>
                        <p>As a consistent supporter and loyal member of the United Nations, my
                            Government, apart from its responsibility toward its people, has the
                            responsibility and obligation of upholding the principles of the
                            Charter. Only two days ago, I explained in detail to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> in the presence of my
                            Foreign Minister our position regarding the admission of Outer Mongolia
                            and requested him to convey my views to the State Department. In reply
                            to your message, I wish to further clarify my position and sincerely
                            hope that you will give it the most sympathetic consideration.</p>
                        <p>Outer Mongolia had been a part of the territory of the Republic of China
                            until it became detached from her as a result of the Sino-Soviet Treaty
                            of Friendship and Alliance, which we entered into on the
                            well-intentioned advice of the United States Government. Without the
                            Sino-Soviet Treaty, there would not have been an independent Outer
                            Mongolia and the question of the admission of Outer Mongolia to the
                            United Nations may not have arisen. When we <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402"
                                facs="0428"/>agreed to the independence of Outer Mongolia, it was
                            our hope to trade for thirty years of amity and peace with Soviet Russia
                            so that we could devote ourselves to the task of national rehabilitation
                            and reconstruction. Subsequent events, however, dealt a blow to such
                            hopes. Soviet Russia, using Outer Mongolia as the base of operation,
                            committed further aggression against the Province of Sinkiang and the
                            North Eastern Provinces and later openly aided the Chinese Communist
                            rebellion resulting finally in the Communist occupation of the mainland.
                            To this day the Chinese people recall the Government’s decision in
                            agreeing to the independence of Outer Mongolia with censure and
                            reprobation. Since the admission of Outer Mongolia became an issue in
                            the United Nations, official views and public sentiments have been
                            firmly opposed to the possibility of such admission. Should our
                            representative on the Security Council fail to prevent the admission of
                            Outer Mongolia, the whole nation as well as the loyal Chinese overseas
                            would not only lose faith in the Government, but would also feel sadly
                            disappointed at their long trusted ally.</p>
                        <p>Since the abrogation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the circumstances in
                            which the Republic of China had agreed to the independence of Outer
                            Mongolia no longer existed. It is therefore our view that the ultimate
                            disposition of Outer Mongolia should be deferred to the future. If under
                            Soviet pressure it is now admitted to the United Nations, it would
                            amount to collective recognition and perpetuation of its present status,
                            thus precluding the possibility of any other settlement. This is a
                            matter which concerns our vital interests. It is analogous to our claim
                            to sovereignty over the Chinese mainland.</p>
                        <p>The regime of Outer Mongolia is in every way a Soviet creation. Both in
                            domestic and foreign affairs it is under rigid Soviet control. It is far
                            from possessing the membership qualifications as provided in the
                            Charter. As you are well aware, Soviet Russia has in the past few years
                            made repeated attempts to secure the admission of the Peiping Communist
                            regime. Thanks to the leadership of the United States and the support of
                            the democratic countries, such attempts have so far been defeated.
                            Soviet Russia has now changed its tactics by insisting on the admission
                            of Outer Mongolia in order to pave the way for the eventual admission of
                            the Peiping puppet regime. The success of this new maneuvre would lead
                            to serious consequences. I am not unaware that if Outer Mongolia is
                            prevented admission by our use of veto in the Security Council, it may
                            adversely affect our position in the United Nations. But should we fail
                            to block the admission of Outer Mongolia, the consequences would be
                            equally, if not more, disastrous to us. For us thus to recognize the
                            fruits of aggression is to abandon our basic stand as a <pb n="403"
                                xml:id="pg_403" facs="0429"/>nation. For the United Nations to admit
                            to membership such a puppet regime in total disregard of the principles
                            of the Charter would further undermine its prestige.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the problem of the admission of new members as a whole, we
                            are prepared, in consideration of the keen desire of the United States
                            to reach an early settlement and the wish of the free applicant nations,
                            to adopt a conciliatory and tolerant stand. We are even prepared not to
                            oppose the admission of the four Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe and
                            to agree to the admission of thirteen free nations in spite of the fact
                            that some of those nations have in fact recognized the Peiping Communist
                            regime. I hope you will agree that despite the extremely difficult
                            position in which we are placed, we are making a genuine effort to
                            cooperate with your Government to the best of our ability.</p>
                        <p>Collective admission of new members is clearly a violation of the
                            relevant Charter provisions; it further contradicts the advisory opinion
                            rendered by the International Court of Justice. It may be recalled that
                            both our Governments have in the past registered opposition to such a
                            procedure. It is apparent that your Government is now prepared to change
                            its stand out of consideration for the need to enable a number of
                            nations to be admitted to the United Nations. We have no desire to block
                            the admission of all the applicant nations. Our only objection lies with
                            Outer Mongolia. Soviet Russia, on the other hand, now threatens to bar
                            the admission of all the thirteen free nations unless Outer Mongolia is
                            simultaneously admitted. Therefore it is Soviet Russia and not the
                            Republic of China that indulges in the abuse of the veto. As the leader
                            of the free nations and a loyal member of the United Nations, it is for
                            the United States to rally other member States in exerting pressure upon

                        <p>I have always placed Sino-American friendship above other considerations
                            in our conduct of foreign affairs. Our two countries should maintain
                            closest cooperation, especially at this critical juncture. I have
                            repeatedly told Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            that the Republic of China is always prepared to accede to the proposals

                            international problems if by so doing it would be beneficial to the
                            United States without affecting China’s vital interests. In fact, the
                            Republic of China has even more than once compromised her position in

                            the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the evacuation of Tachen Islands,

                                <item>We believe the best way to do this and to levy as much blame
                                    as possible on the Soviet Union is to cause a vote to be taken
                                    en bloc in the Security Council on the 17, and we expect that
                                    such a proposal will be placed before the Security Council very
                                    soon. If the Soviet Union then vetoes this en bloc 17-nation
                                    proposal as expected, we would undoubtedly next be faced with a
                                    vote on a proposal en bloc to admit 18. We ourselves do not like
                                    the idea of en bloc voting as such. However, since such a
                                    resolution listing 18 includes so many applicants which we both
                                    favor, we are hopeful it would be less difficult for the
                                    Republic of China to forebear using the veto in an en bloc vote
                                    than it might otherwise be if the applicants were voted on
                                    individually. We believe the vital interests of both the US and
                                    the Republic of China are involved and that we would be held
                                    responsible by large segments of world opinion if a membership
                                    solution was to fall as a result of the veto of the Republic of
                                    China. We urge that the Chinese not use the veto on such an en

                            will be greater support as a result of the admission of new members on

                            Spain, Italy, Austria and others that it was the willingness of the
                            Chinese government to abstain on Outer Mongolia, in light of Soviet
                            insistence on 18 or nothing, which permitted their entrance into the

                            use of the veto by the Chinese government, which would undoubtedly lead
                            to the undercutting of its international position in and out of the

                            among the Chinese people in Formosa and overseas than an abstention

                            item will undoubtedly come up in Ad Hoc Committee about Wednesday. In
                            these circumstances, I would proceed, subject to Department’s views, as
                            follows: <list>

                                <item>Ad Hoc Committee decided its order of items at beginning of

                                    However, if as is likely, a move is made to take up membership
                                    next instead of the Indian item, I believe we should acquiesce.
                                    I am convinced that even if we undertook an active campaign,
                                    which I do not believe is desirable, we could not prevent move

                                    unable to prevent membership coming up next.) Moreover, ad hoc
                                    consideration would give us a little more time to try to

                                    believe is absolutely essential if this whole membership
                                    question is not to have the most serious repercussions on the

                                    which was adopted by the Assembly unanimously. I would make
                                    clear in my statement, however, that our vote in favor of the
                                    Canadian resolution should not be construed as endorsing any
                                    specified number of applicants. If we can get a few others to
                                    take similar line, it would help somewhat to keep the question

                                <item><p>I do not believe it is possible to defeat the Soviet
                                        amendment, even if we oppose it as a whole on the grounds
                                        that it is a package (rather than on a country-by-country
                                        vote). Most of the 28 co-sponsors of the Canadian resolution
                                        interpret it as meaning 18 and are likely therefore to
                                        support the Soviet amendment. In these circumstances, I
                                        believe we should:</p>
                                    <p>Acquiesce in a country-by-country vote on Soviet amendment if
                                        it seems inevitable that one will be had; and in that case
                                        vote in favor of our 13, abstain on their 4, and vote
                                        against Outer Mongolia;</p>
                                    <p>Abstain on the amendment as whole (even if Outer Mongolia
                                        gets majority as we expect).</p>
                                    <p>The Soviet amendment would be adopted by a substantial
                                        majority, I believe, and this would undoubtedly have the
                                        effect of Assembly pressure on the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                            >SC</gloss> for 18. This nevertheless I believe reflects
                                        the Assembly’s view on this matter. I believe that if we
                                        voted in the negative in vote on the Soviet amendment as a
                                        whole, it would be interpreted by the <gloss target="#t_LA1"
                                            >LA</gloss>’s as a vote against Spain and Italy and by
                                        the Afro-Asians as a vote against the Bandung list.</p>

                                    possible in order to give Council opportunity to take early
                                    action and report back at present Assembly. In event Council
                                    action then delayed or is negative, we may be confronted with
                                    resumed Tenth Session or a special session (possibly in January)

                        <p>“Dear Mr. President: I have received through your Embassy under date of
                            November 26 your message in reply to mine of the twenty-second.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d188fn2">See <ref target="#d185">Documents 185</ref>
                                and <ref target="#d176">176</ref>.</note> I am impressed by the
                            strong case to be made against the independence of the present régime
                            controlling Outer Mongolia. I agree that it should be perfectly clear
                            that neither of our countries admits that Outer Mongolia is now
                            independent any more than is Byelorussia, the Ukraine or Albania.
                            Neither should we accept the legality or the rightfulness of the
                            enforced detachment of Outer Mongolia from the Republic of China.</p>
                        <p>Both of our countries can, and I think should, make clear our attitude
                            toward Outer Mongolia. The central issue is not whether there is or is
                            not a good case against Outer Mongolia, but whether a good case can be
                            made for use of the veto in the Security Council, a highly artificial
                            voting procedure whereby any one of the 5 permanent members can thwart
                            the will of the great majority.</p>
                        <p>The United States has never believed that the veto power should be used
                            in the Security Council to prevent an election to membership of those
                            approved by two-thirds majority of the General Assembly and by 7 of the
                            11 members of the Security Council. We have never ourselves used the
                            veto under these circumstances. Three of the other 4 permanent members,
                            namely, France, the UK and the Soviet Union, although each finding that
                            the proposed admissions of 18 involve admitting certain states highly
                            distasteful to them have nevertheless felt that they should bow to the
                            weight of world opinion and accept the result wanted by the great
                            majority of the present members and by 13 other free nations who are
                            applicants for membership.</p>
                        <p>I greatly hope that instead of resorting to a highly technical voting
                            right which would have the effect of defeating the overwhelming desire
                            of the members in effecting the solution of the membership problem on an
                            over-all basis, you will decide that your legal and moral position which
                            you so eloquently set forth can be <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409"
                                facs="0435"/>maintained by a clarifying statement made at the time
                            that you act. We expect to follow the same procedure.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that at San Francisco all 5 of the permanent members
                            agreed that the veto power should be used with great caution and that it
                            should not be abused. I am afraid that the use by your Government of the
                            veto under these circumstances would be judged by the world opinion
                            which we all need to value and respect as an “abuse” in view of the fact
                            that you can by a timely statement make clear the juridical position
                            which you describe.</p>
                        <p>Permit me therefore in the name of our friendship and the friendship of
                            our two countries to urge that you should reconsider the matter in the
                            light of the point of view which I take the liberty of presenting.

                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_BVA1">Belaunde</persName> (Peru) what he had decided
                            regarding suggestion of yesterday that he put in a motion providing for
                            the admission of 17 and for reference of the application of Outer
                            Mongolia to the Council’s Committee on Admission of New Members.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BVA1">Belaunde</persName> said he would not do this
                            and he gave the following reasons. The Good Offices Committee at its
                            first meeting decided that there should be no discrimination among any
                            of the applications. The Committee also decided that it should make no
                            proposals, and that since the East had already made a proposal, all
                            proposals should come from the Western powers. He also added that the
                            Good Offices committee had been elected by 60 members and that it would
                            therefore be difficult for him to submit a proposal. He asked <persName

                            today. <persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> asked for our
                            reactions to UK introduction in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> of the
                            following proposal:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a draft resolution recommending that all applicants be
                            admitted to the United Nations, except Korea, the Democratic People’s
                            Republic of Korea, Vietnam, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> explained that the rationale for
                            the above proposal was that it would be much more difficult for the
                            Chinese to veto a package of 18 because there are so many states
                            included which they and we want in. Secondly, it would have the effect
                            of getting all 18 in if the Chinese were willing to forebear the use of
                            the veto. <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> explained that
                            they envisaged a procedure whereby the Chinese would seek to amend the
                            above resolution to exclude Outer Mongolia and/or to put it in category
                            of divided states, that this amendment would be defeated, and then the
                            Chinese would be faced with either acquiescing in the 18 or vetoing the
                            entire 18— something which, the UK believes, the Chinese would find more
                            difficult to do than to veto Outer Mongolia separately. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> envisaged exploring this matter
                            both with the Canadians and the Belgians if we are agreeable.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> put to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> the idea of a 17 nation proposal
                            plus referral of the application of Outer Mongolia to the Security
                            Council’s Committee on admission of new members.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> said “we absolutely cannot
                            do it.” Both he and <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName>
                            alluded to Ceylonese pressure, Canadian pressure in favor of 18, and the
                            fact that supporting such a 17 nation proposal would mean putting the UK
                            in the position of voting in favor of Albania while excluding Outer
                            Mongolia—something which public opinion in the UK would not
                            understand.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said his offhand personal
                            reaction to UK proposal was negative. He said we should proceed with the
                            proposal for 17 with view to focusing failure for a solution on the
                            Russians. If we proceed with the UK proposal, it would mean that blame
                            would be directed to Chinese Nationalists. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> said that it would be better to go through the ad
                            hoc and not have the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> consider the
                            membership question at all, rather than proceed with a proposal for
                            18.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> said you cannot get away
                            without <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> consideration of the
                            membership question and that, in his view, it was a question of either
                            the UK putting in a proposal for the 18 or being confronted with a
                            proposal on the 18 put in by the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_NA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> added you cannot smother the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> exercise and there is no hope of having
                            membership question wither away. Moreover, he said our 17 nation
                            proposal would not get seven votes because several <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412"
                                facs="0438"/>were already committed to 18 and a proposal for 18 was
                            bound to be introduced. <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName>
                            said it should be less difficult to support a proposal on the 18 made by
                            the UK than a proposal made by the Soviets.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> said this was his personal
                            reaction and that he would refer the UK proposal to Washington
                            immediately. In the meantime, he asked UK not to go ahead on this matter
                            until we had received word from the State Department. Both <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA1">Nutting</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1"
                                >Dixon</persName> agreed that they would hold off until they had
                            heard from us.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that we would not oppose a move in the ad hoc committee to
                            take up membership next.</p>

                                    which was to advance U.S. interests. The Ambassador objected
                                    specifically to the passage “indicating ‘desire [China] commit

                            Chiang’s departure from Taipei for few days. Substance of message

                            full Chinese translation reached him only following morning. He
                            instructed Foreign Minister by telephone to acknowledge message with
                            thanks and to say he would reply shortly. Chiang added that <gloss

                            alternative to veto could be worked out.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister today assured me once more of his anxiety to avoid use
                            of veto. However, he regards it as pure “power politics” that Soviets
                            have used veto more than 70 times with impunity while dire effects on
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> are predicted if it uses veto
                            once on excellent historical grounds.</p>

                            wonder whether US had made commitment to Soviets. Meanwhile, he is
                            working actively on possible means to avoiding veto.</p>

                        <p>1243. Foreign Minister yesterday afternoon gave me following which is
                            text of statement made to Government of China:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Begin verbatim text:</hi></p>
                        <p>You are well aware that the admission of Japan to the United Nations has
                            been a longstanding and fervent national aspiration. Viewed in the light
                            of the present international situation, Japan’s role as a member state
                            of the United Nations will be a most significant one, contributing to
                            the strengthening of the solidarity of free nations.”</p>
                        <p>However, in view of the current discussion in New York on the admission
                            of new members, it seems the admission of Japan to the United Nations
                            along with other free nations depends upon the attitude of your
                            country—namely whether or not your country will exercise the veto powers
                            in the Security Council on the admission of Outer Mongolia. If your
                            government should resort to veto, it would not be of any help in solving
                            your problem of Outer Mongolia, but would gravely affect the
                            international position of your country. Moreover, such act would be
                            extremely regrettable to Japan, because it would close the door to
                            Japan’s admission to the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Japan earnestly desires that your country will proceed
                            with prudence and circumspection.</p>

                            short-sighted on this issue, is losing friends when not in good position
                            suffer such losses.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName>. Re membership. After
                            great deal of hard thinking on membership question I have come to
                            following conclusions: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The sentiment on membership has grown to such proportions that
                                    an 18 applicant solution seems like the least objectionable
                                    outcome in view of the fact that events since my last wire have
                                    moved so fast that we cannot either shelve the membership
                                    question or have it fail without serious consequences which
                                    would include a great share of the blame for US and a determined
                                    effort by numerous delegations to expel the Chinese should they
                                    use their veto. The possibility of the 17 package proposal which
                                    would have been so effective is now, I fear, outdistanced by
                                    events.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We should continue to use every effort we can to convince the
                                    Chinese that they should not veto. If this is unsuccessful, the
                                    procedure which might make it most possible for them to refrain
                                    from the veto is to see that an 18 state resolution without
                                    division is voted in the Security Council. I feel that voting on
                                    the candidates separately may well open a Pandora’s box and
                                    produce all the worst aspects of a failure in the membership
                                    question. If the Chinese should insist and veto an 18 state
                                    resolution, which I think will be very difficult for them to do,
                                    it will indicate that they have deliberately thwarted the will
                                    of the great majority of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                    members. If this should happen, despite our strong
                                    representations, we would not have to bear the full onus both
                                    for a failure on the membership problem and for what
                                    subsequently might happen to the Chinese in the <gloss

                                    consistent with our vote in the Security Council. The essential
                                    thing is that we not be prevented, by our action in the ad hoc
                                    committee, from supporting an 18 state resolution in the

                            seem to me that we are faced with a condition and not a theory and that
                            political considerations here are overwhelming and would seem to dictate

                                    like to say that it is evident that there are two arbitrary
                                    positions on this question, both of them apparently
                                    irreconcilable—one, the USSR position and two, the Chinese
                                    Nationalist position. In view of this situation, it would seem
                                    to him that there is no use in calling a Security Council

                                    that the majority of the delegations in the <gloss

                                    expressed the view that there should be agreement never to use
                                    the veto to prevent the admission of new members.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In application of the foregoing principles, we shall continue to seek the
                            admission of all qualified states which have applied. They would be
                            members already if the great majority had its way. Only the Soviet veto,
                            or threat of veto, bars them.</p>
                        <p>There are 6 European applicants clearly qualified for membership, namely,
                            Austria, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. There are the 7
                            Asian-African applicants whose membership was recommended by the Bandung
                            Conference for present admission, namely, Cambodia, Ceylon, Japan,
                            Jordan, Laos, Libya and Nepal.</p>
                        <p>All of these 13 we support. We believe that there are other qualified
                            applicants. For example, we do not believe that the Republic of Korea
                            should be barred from membership merely because part of its territory is
                            wrongfully and forcefully detached from the authority of what this
                            General Assembly has held to be the only lawfully elected government in
                            Korea. The Republic of Vietnam is another qualified applicant, barred
                            only by Soviet veto.</p>
                        <p>We shall not support in any form the applications made for Albania,
                            Bulgaria, Hungary, Outer Mongolia and Rumania. In our opinion, the
                            governments of these states are not now independent, and their present
                            subject status constitutes, or derives from, a violation of treaties and
                            other international engagements.</p>

                        <p>The United States recognizes, however, that the issues before us are
                            those about which there can be honest differences of opinion. For this
                            reason, among others, it is not our intention to use the veto in the
                            Security Council to thwart what may be the will of a qualified majority
                            in the Security Council and in the General Assembly in relation to the
                            subject matter of the Canadian Resolution. If and as this brings before
                            the Security Council resolutions on admission which, in our opinion,
                            involve infractions of the Charter, we shall, in accordance with the
                            spirit of the <persName corresp="#p_VAH1">Vandenberg</persName>
                            Resolution, abstain from voting so as not to exercise, in this matter of
                            admissions, the veto power.</p>
                        <p>We shall abstain from voting on the Canadian Resolution now before us,
                            and on the proposed Soviet amendment thereto, because while in form this
                            Resolution only requests the Security Council to ‘consider’ certain
                            applications, some practical interpretations of that Resolution are such
                            that we hesitate to vote for it lest that might seem to involve us in a
                            departure from our principles enumerated above.</p>
                        <p>It is our earnest hope that out of the present discussion will come the
                            admission of those qualified states whose exclusion clearly violates our
                            Charter, and whose presence amongst us will add greatly to the wisdom of
                            our councils and to the weight of moral authority which is exercised by
                            this Organization.”</p>

                            Natural tendency among sponsors of free world candidates whose hopes
                            thus frustrated would be to censure China, perhaps in intemperate terms
                            already used by some to press. This seems to me neither justified
                            historically nor to our interest.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore some nations in past have supported <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> only with
                            reluctance, and above development (if it occurs) would provide excuse
                            and opportunity for more open opposition to <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>. Such trend could greatly facilitate early replacement

                        <p>Atmosphere of vexation could lead some delegates, after voting, to
                            indulge in strong criticisms <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, which
                            could snow-ball as each orator sought new phrases to express his
                            indignation. Since it is in long-run interest of US that <gloss

                            recognizing its right exercise veto under Charter regardless our
                            disagreement (in contrast to Red satellites) and hoping thus set calmer
                            tone for any succeeding speaker.</p>
                        <p>While US delegate need not recapitulate all reasons for China’s decision,
                            he could express sympathy with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>’s
                            problems, cite its past record (in contrast to USSR’s) and present

                            application. I wonder whether something could be worked out by your
                            representative and ours at the United Nations either to have the
                            application of Outer Mongolia dropped or to have its consideration
                            technically postponed. As I stated in my last message, we are fully
                            prepared to go along with you if Outer Mongolia is dropped or detached
                            from the present list of 18 applicants, even though the admission of the
                            17 new members would possibly weaken my government’s position in the
                            United Nations. We have taken this conciliatory attitude solely out of
                            our desire to cooperate with you to the best of our ability. You will no
                            doubt understand that even without your friendly advice we are naturally
                            anxious to avoid having to use the veto in view of our present position
                            in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>“I well know that to other governments Outer Mongolia may seem just
                            another Soviet satellite. But to us, the consequences of the admission
                            of Outer Mongolia to the United Nations would be extremely unfavorable
                            and far-reaching. It would also, I feel seriously damage the prestige of
                            the United Nations as well as the moral leadership of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>“By resorting to the technique of a package deal, it is clearly Soviet
                            Russia’s design to induce all of us to accept Outer Mongolia’s <pb
                                n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0450"/>application without any
                            reference to Charter provisions. The acceptance of such a “deal” would
                            set a precedent whereby any applicant state not possessing the necessary
                            qualifications for membership and having committed acts of aggression
                            may be admitted, thus paving the way for the eventual entry of the
                            Peiping Communist regime. That the Soviet insistence on Outer Mongolia’s
                            admission as a condition for not using the veto on 13 of the other
                            applicant states is an act of unadulterated blackmail is clear to all.
                            It is most regrettable that a number of member states of the United
                            Nations should be giving it support and even pressing my Government to
                            accept this deal by threatening to raise again the question of China’s
                            representation. Should this be tolerated, the United Nations would no
                            longer be an instrument for international peace and justice; it would
                            soon become a tool of Soviet Communism. I honestly feel that it is
                            incumbent upon the United States, with all its strength and prestige, to
                            firmly oppose the admission of Outer Mongolia as a condition for the
                            admission of the other applicant states. So far as China is concerned, a
                            mere statement of our opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia
                            would not be adequate. It would be tantamount to forfeiting our national
                            stand and failing to fulfill our obligations under the Charter.</p>
                        <p>“I, therefore, once more appeal to you as a friend and hope that you will
                            find it possible to instruct your permanent representative at the United
                            Nations to further explore the possibility of a solution in which the
                            application of Outer Mongolia for membership will not be involved.</p>
                        <p>“I am greatly cheered by reports of your speedy recovery and trust that
                            this will find you in your best health.</p>

                                in hands of Foreign Minister and seemingly is prolonging his stay at

                                Rather it seems to them simply another step along road of
                                appeasement and retreat, pursued past ten years on US and other well
                                meaning advice. With end of road almost in sight they are making

                        <p>President Chiang’s reply (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 517)
                            suggests he may still believe Outer Mongolia can be dropped and
                            remaining candidates admitted to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. It
                            is imperative that you make certain that Chinese authorities are under
                            no misapprehension on this point. Issue is not whether we want Outer
                            Mongolia or other satellites in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or
                            whether China should be given an “offsetting advantage”. Issue is
                            whether use of veto in circumstances is justifiable. Plain fact is that
                            a Chinese veto in anticipated circumstances will be regarded, rightly or
                            wrongly, by most <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members as an abuse
                            of privilege and that consequences it appears will be of utmost gravity
                            for China.</p>
                        <p>You should spare no effort to bring this situation home to President
                            Chiang and other Chinese authorities and to convince them that in

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked about the
                            reaction of the President to the Generalissimo’s reply to the second
                            letter of the President on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            membership question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said the reaction was very bad. He
                            feared that neither the Generalissimo nor <persName>George</persName>
                            Yeh realized the full implications of what they were doing. There was no
                            United States-Soviet deal, as they seemed to suspect. The U.S. was
                            trying to save the position of the Chinese Government in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The fact that two personal messages from
                            the President and one from the Secretary were dispatched to President
                            Chiang shows how seriously we view the situation. This was no ordinary
                            procedure. When appeals of such extraordinary character are summarily
                            turned down by the Chinese Government, the effect naturally is
                            unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>He said that the U.S. does not think any of the five satellite states are
                            qualified for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership but the
                            Vandenburg resolution of 1948 recommends against U.S. use of the veto on
                            membership questions to frustrate the will of the majority. The Chinese
                            representation problem is different. China is already a member of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the dispute is one of
                            accreditation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> will state the
                            U.S. position, and will abstain on the vote, but the U.S. will refrain
                            from using the veto so as not to frustrate the will of the majority. It
                            is not correct to assume that the admission of the 18 countries would
                            represent a complete Communist victory. The Soviets do not like a number
                            of the countries that would be admitted: Spain and Ireland, for
                            instance. The U.S. was only asking President Chiang if he would exercise
                            a restraint similar to that of the U.S. as to the veto. He is not being
                            asked to swallow his objections. The U.S. would expect him to voice them
                            freely. But the use of the veto to defeat the majority will, would be
                            likely to arouse widespread indignation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. The free countries involved would say that they were
                            kept out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as a result of the
                            Chinese veto.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said his
                            Government had made quite a concession in withholding its objections to
                            the applications of the four European satellites.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> remarked that Outer Mongolia was no
                            different in principle from the four European satellites.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> disagreed, so far
                            as the Chinese viewpoint was concerned. He said that the creation of the
                            puppet state of Outer Mongolia was a direct result of Soviet aggression
                            and a violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> recalled that for a long number of
                            years the Chinese Government had never had more than a very tenuous
                            control of Outer Mongolia. For whatever reason, the Chinese Government
                            had agreed to the plebiscite which had resulted in Mongolia’s nominal
                            independence. The Chinese Government had recognized Outer Mongolia
                            independence and in 1946 had voted for Outer Mongolia’s admission to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that China
                            had acted in this way because of its obligations under the 1945
                            Sino-Soviet Treaty. His Government had tried to observe the Treaty in
                            good faith. But the Treaty had been flouted by the Soviet Union. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> itself had condemned the Soviet
                            Union for breaking the Treaty. The Chinese Government was no longer
                            obligated by the Treaty and had therefore denounced it. Outer Mongolia
                            presented a different situation from the European satellites, so far as
                            China was concerned. This was because of the special relationship of
                            Outer Mongolia to China. He said that the problem was a very difficult
                            one for his Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said it was also difficult for the
                            U.S. Government which considered none of the five satellites qualified
                            for membership under the Charter. However, the overwhelming majority of
                            the other countries favored admission of the satellites in order to
                            obtain admission of the thirteen deserving candidates. The U.S.
                            Government thinks the Chinese Government is right in principle but does
                            not agree that it is right as to its procedure, if a veto is
                            contemplated. The U.S. position is consistent as to all five satellites.
                            But the U.S. cannot see that the Chinese position is consistent in not
                            exercising the veto as to four, and exercising it as to one. We do not
                            see any logical distinction between the four and the one. As far as the
                            Charter requirements are concerned, there are no differences between
                            Outer Mongolia and the other four.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that his
                            Government had never used the veto on a membership question before. But
                            the present situation had never arisen before.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said that if the Chinese vetoed, they
                            would relieve the Soviets of the calumny which should attach to them. He
                                <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0455"/>was confident that the
                            Soviets would pay money to get the Chinese to veto. It was more
                            important to them than obtaining <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            membership for the satellites.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that he felt
                            that the moral authority and dedication to principle of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be gone once it yielded to
                            blackmail.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> pointed out that Albania, Bulgaria,
                            Hungary, and Rumania all stood indicted by the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> for nonperformance of treaty obligations and violation
                            of human rights. It did not seem that the Chinese Government was
                            consistent in overlooking the shortcomings of these four while singling
                            out Outer Mongolia for veto.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> then read excerpts from a telegram
                            sent to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> the
                            preceding day which set forth the serious situation created by the
                            Chinese position. It seemed to us that the position of the Chinese
                            Government indicated that it was out of touch with the realities of the
                            situation. The Chinese Government was not being asked to express
                            approval. We expected and wanted the Chinese Government to express
                            disapproval, as the U.S. representative would do.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that failure
                            to exercise the veto would allow the Russians to have their way.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> pointed out that it would be the “way”
                            of the majority and that the Soviets by no means would have their way
                            completely. It was a compromise.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese were about to walk into a Soviet trap. A veto would transfer
                            all the onus from the Soviet Government to the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> thought it was
                            still a question of moral principle.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said T.F. <persName corresp="#p_TTF1"
                                >Tsiang</persName>’s recent interview in New York amounted almost to
                            a slap at the President, since it seemed to be in the nature of a
                            rejection of the second appeal of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> to the Generalissimo. T.F. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName> had called in the press before a
                            reply was sent by President Chiang to the President.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said he felt that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName> had been trapped by
                                <hi rend="italic">N.Y.Times</hi> correspondent Thomas J. Hamilton,
                            who had telephoned <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName> and
                            pressed him for a statement of his intentions. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TTF1">T.F. Tsiang</persName> was not actually replying
                            to the President’s message.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said it was interpreted in some
                            quarters as a reply, although he felt certain it was not intended to
                            be.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> assured Mr.
                                <persName>Robertson</persName> that nothing said by T.F. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName> was intended as a reply to the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked if there
                            would be a third message from the President. Mr.
                                <persName>Robertson</persName> answered negatively. The President
                            had already been turned down twice.</p>
                        <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0456"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> mentioned
                                <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">T.F. Tsiang</persName>’s suggestion that
                            a special committee be appointed to study the qualifications of Outer
                            Mongolia for membership. This would delay matters and afford an
                            opportunity to work things out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said he did not know whether there was
                            any hope in such a suggestion. The situation was desperate. Many of the
                            enemies of China were working to get the Chinese in the very position
                            its representatives seemed determined to take.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> mentioned that
                            Cuba had proposed that the Republics of South Korea and South Vietnam be
                            added to the list of candidates.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said this would be fine if it could be
                            limited to these Governments. But the Soviets would then put up the
                            puppet regimes of North Korea and the Viet Minh for membership. So this
                            would merely compound the problem. The ratio would be two against two
                            which was not as favorable as 13 against five.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked if we felt
                            that there was any chance of a delay.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said it was doubtful. The question
                            might come up at any moment. The U.S. was terribly concerned. It was an
                            issue of the utmost gravity to the vital interests of China. Yet we had
                            the impression that the matter had been left largely in the hands of
                            Foreign Minister Yeh while the Generalissimo was off at Sun Moon
                            Lake.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that his
                            Government attached great importance to the messages from the President.
                            It was for this reason that some time had been taken for the
                            replies.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that the
                            Generalissimo had raised a question as to the possibility of a
                            compromise. This might open the way for a further exchange of messages.
                            He felt it would be very desirable for the President or the Secretary to
                            send another message replying to the specific question raised by the
                            Generalissimo as to whether every possibility had been fully explored.
                            If we informed the Generalissimo that every channel had already been
                            explored and there was no possibility of any new approach, the
                            Generalissimo might have something more to say.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> remarked that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> had been discouraged by the
                            Chinese from going to Sun Moon Lake to present the President’s second
                            letter in person.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that the
                            Generalissimo sometimes wanted to be alone when he was considering
                            weighty issues. Furthermore, the inn at Sun Moon Lake was often crowded.
                            This would certainly be the case with six visiting Congressmen at Sun
                            Moon Lake with the Generalissimo.</p>
                        <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0457"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said the fact remained that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> never got to present
                            the second message personally. It appeared that
                                <persName>George</persName> Yeh had drafted the reply. We felt that
                            we were at the end of our rope. We had exhausted every possibility.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> reiterated that he
                            felt the second reply from President Chiang left the door open a little.
                            It invited some reply. Another message through Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> might help.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said we have already made every effort
                            imaginable to have the Outer Mongolian application dropped. We have made
                            this clear to Taipei but there is no evidence that our points have ever
                            been appreciated. But if it might help, we would be willing to send one
                            more message from the Secretary pointing out that no stone has been left
                            unturned; that we have explored every possibility open to us; and that
                            we urge once more that the Generalissimo reconsider his proposed course
                            of action.</p>

                        <p>The Italian Ambassador called today under instructions from his Prime
                            Minister (the Foreign Minister has not yet returned from the Far East)
                            to present Sig. Segni’s views on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            membership problem for the Secretary’s consideration. The Ambassador
                            began by <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0458"/>saying that the
                            Italian Government and the Embassy here were extremely grateful for
                            everything that the U.S. had done to support the Italian application for
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; that should Italy
                            be admitted this year it would be through the efforts of the U.S. and
                            not by the grace of the USSR. The Italian Government understood, Sig.
                            Brosio continued, the problem which a package solution created for the
                            U.S., particularly one including Outer Mongolia. This situation,
                            according to reports, had led the U.S. to a decision to abstain on the
                            entire membership question.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary, who indicated agreement with the Ambassador’s statement
                            thus far, interrupted to explain the American position. He said that our
                            decision was influenced by three considerations: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That we wish to see as many as possible of the eligible and
                                    qualified states in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss>.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That we wish to see them admitted within the spirit of the
                                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> charter as interpreted by
                                    the advisory opinion of the International Court.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>That <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership was not an
                                    appropriate subject in which to exercise the veto.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In reviewing these considerations, it had been decided that the most
                            appropriate course for the U.S. to follow with respect to the membership
                            proposal for all 18 applicants, which is now before the General
                            Assembly, was to abstain.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that the primary consideration at the moment
                            was the threat of the Chinese Nationalist veto in the Security Council
                            of Outer Mongolia’s application. He reviewed the history of the creation
                            of Outer Mongolia stemming from the Soviet Chinese Treaty of August,
                            1945 in which Chiang Kai-shek paid a heavy price for the promise of
                            Soviet support of his government. The Secretary described the Soviet
                            Union’s duplicity in this instance as one of the greatest frauds in
                            history. He added that similar cases could be made against the European
                            satellites such as Albania, etc. and that we could not bring ourselves
                            to cast a positive vote for them or Outer Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>The Italian Ambassador expressed his understanding of our feelings on
                            this question but added that his government had a public opinion problem
                            also. He went on to say that should Italy enter the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> with the Soviet Union voting in favor and
                            the U.S. abstaining, the Social Communists in Italy would be presented
                            with a powerful propaganda weapon: i.e. that Italy had entered the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> with a favorable Russian vote and
                            in spite of the abstention of the U.S. In order to insure that the U.S.
                            position be clear to the average Italian, the Prime Minister had asked
                            the Ambassador to submit for the Secretary’s consideration three
                            proposals for action: <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0459"/>
                            <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That the resolution proposing the admission of the 18
                                    applicants for membership be “global” in character in the
                                    introductory phrases but that it so list each applicant
                                    separately that the U.S. would have an opportunity to indicate
                                    its favorable vote for Italy, Spain, Austria, etc. and its
                                    abstention on Albania, Outer Mongolia, etc.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>If his suggestion to vote on each applicant separately would
                                    endanger the entire proposal, then the Italian Premier hoped
                                    that the U.S. would be able to cast an affirmative vote for the
                                    package proposal with a clear statement rejecting any
                                    implication that its vote favored the satellites. (Premier Segni
                                    felt that a positive vote by the U.S. would influence the
                                    Chinese Nationalists at least to abstain on Outer Mongolia while
                                    an abstention on our part would make it easier for them to veto
                                    the package.)</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The same effect as in No. 2 might be achieved if the U.S.
                                    decided to abstain by making a clear statement at the time of
                                    our vote that our abstention implied no disinterest in the
                                    admission of our friends such as Italy, Spain, Austria, etc.,
                                    whose membership we had consistently supported and
                                    welcomed.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Ambassador added that he had been instructed to say that his Prime
                            Minister hoped that the United States would find it possible to vote
                            affirmatively on the membership resolution rather than abstain; in other
                            words, follow alternative No. 2 rather than 3.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he had been in Rome recently and that he knew
                            and appreciated the views of the Italian Government on this question and
                            the problem which it had in the face of its public opinion. He added,
                            however, that we had a public opinion problem here as well. With respect
                            to our influence on the Chinese Nationalists, the Secretary said that
                            our position of abstention was one which the Taipei Government might
                            find possible to accept for themselves, although he was not hopeful. If
                            we should switch to an affirmative vote we would lose all influence on
                            them and they might be more inclined to cast a negative note [<hi

                        <p>The Ambassador said that, if he understood correctly, he would report as
                            follows to his Government: <list>

                                <item>That the Secretary did not believe that U.S. abstention on the

                                    Nationalists to exercise their veto—rather, the contrary.</item>

                                <item>That should the U.S. feel obliged (which apparently was the

                                    question, that our abstention would be accompanied by a clear
                                    statement that we favored admission of such countries as Italy,
                                    Spain, Austria, etc., and that our abstention related only to
                                    our distaste of the satellites.</item>

                        <p>President then asked me to state my case. I said that it had been
                            presented in two messages from President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> and two from Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. I had no official information
                            to add, but I was under instructions to emphasize strongly to him the
                            seriousness with which the United States regarded the matter. I took
                            occasion however to review developments as far as known to me. We seemed
                            to be in box. Something had happened about mid-November (communications
                            from Department suggest November 17–21) but I did not have details. US
                            had done its best, I was sure, but we were now confronted with a most
                            difficult and complex situation.</p>
                        <p>I then sketched briefly <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> history as
                            regards universality of membership, collective security etc. My purely
                            personal view was that events had overtaken question of revising
                            charter. For better or worse <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> was
                            again moving toward universality of membership with responsibility for
                            collective security passing largely over to multilateral and bilateral
                            defense arrangements. Unhappily many provisions of Charter could no
                            longer be taken literally. While <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> had
                            excellent legal case, it must be considered in light of laws already
                            outdated and which no one would enforce. I thought <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> also had good moral case from its point
                            of view, but there was another moral case. All countries of free world
                            including <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> wished to see number of
                            states admitted to <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> (I mentioned
                            Spain, Japan and Italy in particular). Many nations among our friends
                            felt strongly on subject while only China and Russia were interested in
                            Outer Mongolia as such. To most of free world, bringing deserving
                            nations into <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> was much bigger moral
                            issue than that with which <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> at
                            present concerned.</p>
                        <p>I added that whatever future in store for <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >UNO</gloss>, membership in organization remained very important:
                            witness strong desire of additional countries to enter. We wanted <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to remain in <gloss target="#t_UNO1"
                                >UNO</gloss> and to maintain its position, both because we valued
                            its presence and support for our side and because it was block to entry
                            of Red China. In summary US had done its best in present case but had
                            not <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0464"/>succeeded. We were asking
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> to go along in its interest and
                            ours, making best of difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>President then reviewed history past several years (memorandum
                                follows)<note n="3" xml:id="d208fn3">Not printed.</note> explaining
                            how US had frequently misunderstood China’s problems. All experience had
                            shown that any form of neutralism was bad for <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>; it must stick to principles. He cited League of
                            Nations in Manchuria, pro-Japanese British policy before war,
                            Sino-Soviet Treaty, Marshall mission etc. <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss>’s continued stay in <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss>
                            would be for two reasons only: (1) as symbol of anti-communism and (2)
                            as acknowledgment of moral support it continues [receive] from US.
                            Otherwise its continued presence in <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss>
                            could bring more shame and disgrace to China than if not there. <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> not proposing use veto as blackmail in
                            hope of getting something; US should understand that.</p>
                        <p>Chiang then mentioned Russia, stating he could not understand how in
                            present case <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> considered worse
                            rascals than Soviets, who have used veto 25 times on membership
                            questions. US puts all blame on <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in
                            present case (Foreign Minister noted he was referring to messages from
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>) thereby placing seal of
                            approval on Soviet actions. No Chinese with sense of justice can accept
                            this, President said.</p>
                        <p>Chiang then compared package deal with Sino-Soviet treaty, particularly
                            in light of US-<gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> relationships.
                            Present proposal not only against <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            interests but conclusion inescapable that US giving deal at least tacit
                            support. Therefore this case affects US moral leadership of free world
                            far more than in case of Sino-Soviet treaty as he believed history would
                            prove. He considered Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> very able and a friend who has made no mistakes
                            so far, but he warned that package deal might wipe out all previous
                            achievements.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Despite strong statements described
                            above, I believe Chiang may be softening slightly. He remarked my
                            presentation of US case was best he had heard. But he still convinced we
                            have made deal behind <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> back and took
                            second paragraph of Secretary’s December 6 message as further
                            confirmation, particularly since France and Belgium have abstained in
                            committee vote. If we could take <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>
                            somewhat more into our confidence on what US representatives found when
                            they explored possibilities, it might help. Also we have offered him no

                                thereto.</note> Judd’s immediate reaction was most violent and was
                            in large part shared by other members Committee, all of whom apparently
                            feel strongly on <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0468"/>this issue. It
                            was obvious from reaction of Judd and other members of Committee that
                            there would be no point in asking Judd to intercede with Generalissimo.
                            Judd seems to feel, and says this feeling is shared by Generalissimo
                            that if Nationalist China’s action in vetoing package deal results in
                            threat to its international position and even to its expulsion from
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> it can do no other. Judd seems to
                            believe that Chiang’s moral position in this case is completely sound
                            and that what we are doing by “acquiescing” in package deal is to strike
                            death blow at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as it originally
                            conceived. According to Judd, who says he was not personally present,
                            Zablocki and other members of Committee told Generalissimo while in
                            Taiwan that he had their full support in his position.</p>
                        <p>I am afraid that in this case all members of group are completely
                            emotional and do not understand long-term implications of Nationalist
                            China’s veto of the package deal. In fact, Judd even suggested they
                            should talk to Japanese leaders in endeavor to persuade them that it was
                            solely attitude of Soviet Union that was keeping Japan out of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and that Nationalist China is completely
                            right in its stand. I am not sure that I have persuaded them that such
                            action here would be unwise. Committee will be in Tokyo until morning of
                            twelfth if you desire communicate with them further.</p>

                            correspondingly sensitive to any evidence of what might appear to them
                            as new Communist successes. Department will have noted that
                            sub-committee’s message made no reference to Outer Mongolia but
                            reflected grave concern with larger issues implicit in package deal.
                            Presumably they felt that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership
                            for this or that country was comparatively secondary consideration. If
                            so, it is scarcely surprising that President Chiang takes similar view
                            re both new applicants and <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>’s own
                            membership.</p>
                        <p>Of course I discussed with them messages from President and Secretary,

                            mind. Response clearly presaged sub-committee’s message subsequently
                            transmitted in Embassy telegram 528.<note n="3" xml:id="d212fn3"><ref

                            of the admission of new members. Before the Council for consideration
                            were the applications of the countries seeking admission to the United
                            Nations and 13 draft resolutions submitted by the Government of the
                            Republic of China, each one recommending <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444"
                                facs="0470"/>the admission of 1 of 13 countries: Italy, Japan,

                            Jordan, Libya, Austria, and Ireland in that order.</p>
                        <p>During the meeting, the following draft resolutions were presented to the
                            Council: (1) by the Soviet Union providing that the General Assembly
                            vote on the recommendation of the Security Council on each application
                            for membership before the Council proceeded to vote on the next
                            application; (2) by Brazil and New Zealand providing for a Council
                            recommendation to the General Assembly to admit 18 specified countries
                            to the United Nations with the stipulation that a vote would be taken on
                            each of the 18 countries named within the resolution, on each paragraph
                            of the resolution, and then on the resolution as a whole; and (3) 18
                            separate resolutions submitted by the Soviet Union recommending the
                            admission of each of the 18 countries respectively.</p>

                            Prior to their departure this morning House Foreign Affairs Far East
                            Subcommittee requested me to send you following message:</p>
                        <p>“Your prompt reply to our message has been received via <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>. Unfortunately the case
                            presented leaves us quite unconvinced that present position of our
                            government on package deal is right or advisable. We feel compelled to
                            urge again that United States reconsider its position.</p>
                        <p>We believe that US should itself return and urge other governments to
                            return to their firm opposition to such package deals as was shown from
                            1948 until recently, such opposition having been in accordance with the
                            1948 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice.</p>
                        <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0471"/>
                        <p>We cannot agree with the argument that any <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> member should accept the will of a majority when that
                            involves violation of the letter and spirit of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Charter. If principles are to be abandoned whenever a
                            majority believes it expedient, why should we have charters or even
                            constitutions?</p>
                        <p>Is it not better to thwart the will of the majority of nations than to
                            ignore the principles and provisions of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Charter?</p>
                        <p>We believe surrender to Soviet ultimatum would weaken the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and lead inevitably to increased pressure
                            for admission of Red China. Would not the United States have lost its
                            ability to resist effectively such admission which is overwhelmingly
                            opposed by the Congress and the American people? We believe such
                            surrender would surely weaken the hopes and the will to resist on the
                            part of the enslaved peoples behind the iron curtain. Moreover, it is
                            bound to decrease respect for the United States which we must
                            regretfully report is dwindling alarmingly all through the Middle and
                            Far East. All these would strengthen the Communist world position, lead
                            to further Communist ultimatums, and greatly increase the dangers of
                            war.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of government leaders in several of the countries our
                            subcommittee has recently visited that the United States would be
                            compromising on a moral issue. We are convinced that what is morally
                            wrong can never be politically right.</p>
                        <p>Our primary concern is not for the fate of the Chinese Nationalist
                            Government, important though that is. History may well record its veto
                            and steadfast adherence to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter
                            as its finest deed. Our primary concern is for the honor and moral
                            leadership and the future welfare of our own country. Signed Clement J.

                            <item>Meeting of Supporters of Canadian Resolution on Membership</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Following a telegraphic invitation to all 52 members which had voted for
                            the Canadian resolution calling for the admittance of 18 countries to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, a meeting was held at 2:30 today
                            in Conference Room 1. Three countries—Panama, Honduras and
                            Nicaragua—were not present. Possibly others were not either.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Martin</persName> opened the meeting by stating that
                            the supporters of the Canadian resolution should guarantee any “doubting
                            Thomases” that they would assure the entry of all 18 countries into the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if they successfully passed the
                            Security Council. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> of India
                            made a speech along the same line. Thereafter Ambassador Freitas Valle
                            of Brazil arose and stated that he saw no reason for giving such a
                            guarantee, since it was clearly evident that the 52 votes on the
                            Canadian resolution guaranteed the entry of all the countries.
                            Ambassador Arenales of Guatemala objected to the wording of the
                            telegraphic invitation, which mentioned something about harmonizing
                            views on the admittance of the new members. He said it would be
                            difficult to harmonize the views, since the countries all had very
                            divergent ideas on the various candidates.</p>
                        <p>Sir Percy Spender of Australia then stated that he was not entirely happy
                            with the idea of being brought in to give guarantees for anybody. He
                            said his country’s viewpoint had been clearly stated when the vote was
                            held and he did not propose to be crossexamined about how he would vote.
                            He then left the room, leaving a representative of his delegation as an
                            observer.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Urquia of El Salvador proposed that a resolution should be
                            passed by the group, declaring that once the 18 countries had
                            successfully been passed by the Security Council, the block of 52
                            countries which voted for the Canadian resolution would guarantee that
                            all 18 countries would pass the Plenary. In view of the objection to the
                            nature of the meeting as expressed by the Brazilian, Guatemalan and
                            Australian, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName>
                            of Ecuador, who presided, did not put the motion to the vote. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName> closed the meeting by
                            expressing the hope that those present would think the matter over
                            during the night and attempt to come up with some <pb n="447"
                                xml:id="pg_447" facs="0473"/>solution which would assure the happy
                            conclusion of the 18 nation package deal.</p>
                        <p>In short, no action was taken and the question of what will occur in the
                            Security Council meeting is as confused as ever.</p>
                        <p>The telegram sent out to the various delegations today, according to my
                            sources, was signed by <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName>,

                        </list>
                        <p>I telephoned the Brazilian Ambassador today and told him that we had just
                            heard that the Canadians and the Indians were calling a caucus for this
                            afternoon at 2:30 p.m. on the question of the package deal, that all the
                            52 nations which had supported the Canadian proposal were being invited,
                            but those countries which had not supported it were not being included
                            in the invitation. Among those were Cuba, which had opposed the motion,
                            and ourselves who had abstained. I explained to the Ambassador that we
                            were concerned at this since we felt that we were all interested in
                            solving this important question and that we did not feel a meeting
                            should be called excluding countries which were also seeking a solution
                            to this difficult problem. I said the Secretary feared that if this
                            became public knowledge it might have an adverse effect on public
                            opinion of the United Nations in this country. That being the case, we
                            hoped some of the Latin American countries would point out this fact;
                            and perhaps, if the situation could not be clarified, refrain from
                            attending.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he understood entirely; that never in his knowledge
                            had the Latin American countries agreed to attend a meeting from which
                            we were excluded. He would, therefore, get in touch immediately with
                            their Ambassador at the United Nations in New York and see what could be
                            done.</p>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0474"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador called me back a little later and said that he had talked
                            with Freitas-Valle, their representative at the United Nations, who said
                            that he would attend the meeting; he would try to have the United States
                            included; and if they were not able to effect that, they would leave the
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador called a second time at about 5:00 p.m. and said that
                            Freitas-Valle had reported to him that he had gone to the caucus, and
                            said that he didn’t see why a meeting of this character should be held,
                            that the United States should be included or there should not be any
                            such meeting; after which, according to the Ambassador, the caucus was
                            called off.</p>
                        <p>I expressed the appreciation of the Secretary to the Ambassador for the
                            fine help which Brazil had given us in this matter.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The meeting was surrounded by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> security
                            guards.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after 2:30 <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> (UK)
                            retired from the meeting and sat outside the better part of ten minutes
                            before returning to the meeting.</p>
                        <p>A few minutes later <persName corresp="#p_KMR1">Kidron</persName>
                            (Israel) and Nisot (Belgium) came out together. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KMR1">Kidron</persName> told me that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> had objected to the fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Maza</persName> was to be chairman of the
                            meeting on the grounds that the meeting had no relationship to the
                            General Assembly or the President thereof. The meeting then reverted to
                            one of the “52” at which point those others who had been present,
                            including Israel, Belgium and Greece, departed.</p>
                        <p>About 3:15 Spender (Australia) came out under a full head of steam. He
                            said he had thought that he had prevented any possibility of a recording
                            of votes. He said he had spoken to the meeting to the effect that if the
                            delegate of the Soviet Union wished to ascertain <pb n="449"
                                xml:id="pg_449" facs="0475"/>how he, Spender, would vote he need
                            only read the record of his speeches. He thought it most improper that
                            the delegations should be convened in this fashion.</p>
                        <p>When the meeting broke up Mir Khan (Pakistan) said it had been completely
                            chaotic and without any result. A half a dozen people had spoken, among
                            these was <persName corresp="#p_DSPJ1">Dixon</persName> who said it was
                            his understanding that the purpose of the meeting was to reassure the
                            Soviet delegate as to the vote in the General Assembly on membership.
                            The Soviet delegate apparently did not speak.</p>
                        <p>After a half dozen speeches <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1"
                                >Trujillo</persName> (Ecuador) adjourned the meeting with a
                            statement something to the effect that no vote, of course, would be
                            taken, that the purpose of the meeting and its sense was well known.</p>

                            you should know that message sent in Embassy’s 1323 was primarily work
                            of Congressmen Judd and Byrd, although other members of group
                            unhesitatingly signed message. There was some indication, however, that
                            if it had not been for Judd’s vehemence on this matter and strong
                            backing given him by Byrd that other Committee members might have been
                            content with message they had sent from Taipei. I have learned that
                            during reception given committee by <gloss target="#t_FonMin1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> Judd and Byrd brought up question of “package deal”
                            with various Japanese present and they were fortified in their stand by
                            statement of … that although Chinese Nationalists’ action in vetoing
                            membership proposal would go against Japan’s interest, nevertheless, he
                            admired moral position of Chinese Nationalists. Later at dinner at
                            Embassy in evening … made similar statement. …</p>
                        <p>During interview with Prime Minister Hatoyama, Congressman Byrd raised
                            this issue and expressed hope that Japanese government would understand
                            that true villain in matter was Soviet Union and not Nationalist China.
                            Judd went so far as to say that there were <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450"
                                facs="0476"/>many Americans in Congress and out who disapproved of
                            present United States Government stand on this question. Hatoyama
                            blandly replied that he greatly appreciated efforts President <persName

                            of Chiang Kai-shek not to use veto. Fact that Shigemitsu called me in

                        <p>The Security Council of the United Nations once again considered the
                            question of membership at its 703d meeting on December 13. Following
                            lengthy discussion and debate on a number of draft resolutions, the
                            Council decided by a vote of 8 to 1 (China) with 2 abstentions (Belgium
                            and the United States) to give the draft resolution of Brazil and New
                            Zealand calling for the admission of 18 new members (including Outer
                            Mongolia) priority over all other draft resolutions. Paragraph by
                            paragraph votes indicated the impossibility of attaining agreement on
                            the Brazilian-New Zealand draft resolution.</p>
                        <p>At the request of the Soviet Representative, <persName corresp="#p_KVV1"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName>, the Security Council met again on December
                            14, to consider the admission of new members. At this time, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> stated that he wished to
                            withdraw his delegation’s previous negative votes with respect to a
                            number of states and that he would vote in favor of 16 of the applicants
                            listed in the draft resolution sponsored by Brazil and New Zealand. The
                            question of the admission of Japan and of the Mongolian People’s
                            Republic would have to be deferred to the next session of the General
                            Assembly. <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> then
                            submitted a draft resolution similar to the one sponsored by Brazil and
                            New Zealand, but recommending to the General Assembly the admission of
                            only 16 <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0477"/>countries (i.e. the 18
                            listed in the joint Brazilian-New Zealand draft resolution excluding
                            Japan and the Mongolian People’s Republic). <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Henry Cabot Lodge</persName> promptly submitted an amendment to add
                            the name of Japan to the 16 states listed in the Soviet draft
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>The United States amendment was voted on first and received 10 votes in
                            favor and 1 against (the Soviet Union) but was not carried since the
                            negative vote was that of a permanent member of the Security Council.
                            The Soviet draft resolution was voted upon next paragraph by paragraph
                            with each applicant being voted on separately. Although China, the
                            United States, and Belgium abstained from voting for or against certain
                            proposed states, there were no negative votes cast and the Soviet draft
                            resolution as a whole was approved by 8 votes to none with 3
                            abstentions.</p>
                        <p>Following the vote on the Soviet draft resolution, <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Henry Cabot Lodge</persName> submitted a draft
                            resolution to recommend the admission of Japan at the Eleventh Regular
                            Session of the General Assembly. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> noted that Soviet Representative <persName
                                corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName> had made a statement in which
                            he expressed the wish to see Japan admitted to the United Nations at the
                            Eleventh Session of the General Assembly. But the Security Council
                            decided to defer consideration of the United States proposal until the
                            following meeting.</p>
                        <p>Discussion of <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s draft
                            resolution and several others concerning early admission to membership
                            not only of Japan but of the Mongolian People’s Republic continued in
                            the Security Council until December 21, when the Council accepted a
                            draft resolution submitted by the United Kingdom expressing the belief
                            that Japan was fully qualified for membership and the hope that Japan
                            would soon be admitted to the United Nations. After unsuccessfully
                            attempting to obtain adoption of a draft resolution that would link the
                            Mongolian People’s Republic to Japan on the issue of membership
                            qualification and acceptance, the Soviet Representative placed on record
                            his abstention in voting on the United Kingdom resolution.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, at its 555th plenary meeting held the evening of December 14,
                            the General Assembly agreed to admit the 16 applicant states whose
                            admission had been recommended earlier the same day by the Security
                            Council.</p>

                            admission of new members to the United Nations in both the Security

                            United Nations and said he had no objection to press release concerning
                            my call. Verbatim text of statement released to press 1:00 pm Tokyo time

                        <p>Shigemitsu said he and government had been subjected all morning in House
                            of Councillors to vigorous attack as result of Soviet Union veto. He and
                            Prime Minister are being held responsible and Shigemitsu said there was
                            real danger that he might not be able to remain in office. Government is
                            being attacked for too much dependence on United States and for
                            stubbornness in negotiations with Soviet Union which, according to
                            Socialist opposition, is cause of Russia’s veto. He said Government
                            would remain firm in its position and it realizes that Soviet action had
                            been taken for deliberate purpose of causing trouble between friends and
                            putting pressure on Japan to speed up negotiations. I have never seen
                            Shigemitsu look as worried as he did this noon and I believe there is
                                <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0480"/>real substance in his fears
                            that he may be forced to assume responsibility and have to leave

                            in almost every paper. Russians receiving harsher criticism but Soviet

                            against Shigemitsu which defeated in straight party line vote 259–135.
                            Shigemitsu during Diet interpellations stated Soviet veto placing great

                            South Sakhalin by international conference. Shigemitsu also said “Japan

                                >UN</gloss> membership question. Paper’s speculation centered around
                            West’s proposal 15th that Japan be admitted next session, vetoed by
                            USSR, and latter’s proposal linking Japan and Outer Mongolia, which
                            defeated as result West’s abstentions. <hi rend="italic">Asahi</hi>
                            appreciated West’s support, but said gratitude greatly diminished by
                            West’s rejection Soviet plan. Paper also sharply condemned USSR, which
                            it noted had used veto three times since 13th to block Japan’s
                            admission. Essence of <hi rend="italic">Asahi’s</hi> criticism however
                            was that West and particularly Soviet utilizing Japan’s <gloss

                            promote own diplomatic ends, ignoring needs of Japanese people. In this
                            connection <hi rend="italic">Asahi</hi> said that, though Soviets

                            must radically improve relations with small countries, and be on guard

                            re Japan’s <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> membership, presumably to
                            be considered by Security Council December 21, as most promising step
                            available for time being. He thought Soviets probably would not be in
                            position to oppose.<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">See <ref target="#d219"

                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. Andre Ganem (French national on the Advisory Committee) told me at
                            the end of the Assembly he had come to the personal conclusion that the
                            balance of power had now so shifted toward the underdeveloped or
                            anticolonial countries that it would be impossible for the French and
                            other countries with African possessions to deny them self-government
                            for a very long period without coming under very heavy attack in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, an attack which would bring
                            together the anticolonial and Soviet countries.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that there is a great deal of merit in this view, and it
                            occurs to me that it might be worthwhile for the U.S. to catalogue all
                            of the Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories which have nearly
                            reached the point where they might be expected to demand and obtain
                            self-government. If we find there are a number of these countries, like
                            Morocco, Tunis, the Gold Coast and Somali-land, then it might be very
                            wise for the U.S., Britain and France to join as their co-sponsors for
                            admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> next year. It is
                            clear that if we do not do this, the Soviets and the Bandung powers will
                            very shortly do so.</p>
                        <p>It would appear to me that for the next two to three years in any case
                            the Western European countries and the U.S. may expect to be in a
                            minority on many questions in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. We
                            will escape from this minority position only when some of the existing
                            blocs begin to break up. I think we may expect the Latin American bloc
                            to be broken at the next Assembly by some of the countries attaching
                            themselves to Spain and others maintaining their primary loyalty to the
                            U.S. Similarly, if additional countries could be introduced into the
                            Afro-Asian bloc and if this bloc no longer had the common rallying point
                            of anticolonialism, I would think that within a year or two it would
                            tend to disintegrate under the pressures of conflicting leadership from
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>, the
                            pro-Western leaders and the anti-Western leaders.</p>
                        <p>This solution would intensify somewhat the demands on us for assistance
                            in economic development, but this increased pressure <pb n="461"
                                xml:id="pg_461" facs="0487"/>would be relatively slight compared to
                            the political dividends we would get from sponsoring these countries for
                            Membership and the final liquidation of the anticolonial issue.</p>
                        <p>One further thought on Membership is the possibility that we may be
                            confronted in the next round with demands for Membership for the Baltic
                            Soviet states. This would present more complications than were presented
                            in the admission of the most recent group of satellites, and I think
                            that some thought should be given now to what our policy should be in
                            case a request for admission is received.</p>
                        <p>Another proposal, which is related to Membership, which I would like to
                            renew is the suggestion that we make it possible for one member of every
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Delegation, other than the
                            Satellites and the Soviets, to engage in a lecture tour throughout the
                            U.S. at the expense of the U.S. Government. I have often been impressed
                            by the fact that most of the people coming to the U.S. for the first
                            time from the underdeveloped countries, because of their shortage of
                            foreign exchange, see only New York City and, in fact, very few of them
                            even get as far away from New York as Connecticut. It would be desirable
                            it seems to me to expose them to a bit of New England and particularly
                            to the beauties of the Pacific Northwest. This could be arranged through
                            the Leadership Exchange Program of <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss>, I believe. If you think the idea has any merit, I would
                            be glad to put the suggestion in proper form for transmittal to the
                            Department.</p>

                        <p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 11. At my request Canadian
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> called
                            at Embassy residence yesterday morning. Conversation lasting half-hour
                            devoted exclusively to discussion and clarification of recent Canadian
                            initiative in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> re membership.</p>
                        <p>Saying that I had asked to see him for purpose of clearing up matter
                            which had been source of irritation and some bitterness in US-Canadian
                            relations, I outlined at some length basis for unfavorable view US took
                            of Outer Mongolia’s candidacy for membership. I <pb n="462"
                                xml:id="pg_462" facs="0488"/>said that Soviets had violated 1945
                            agreements with China and that its action had been condemned by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Never had there been a more
                            perfidious action on the part of the Soviets, and, in formulating their
                            18-member package deal, the Canadians had asked the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to put the seal of approval on this
                            perfidy. I said Canadian proposal had been made without adequate
                            consultation with the US and had put us in an awkward and embarrassing
                            position. I reminded him that when I had spoken to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> in Geneva on this subject he
                            had replied that USSR was only “supporting the Canadian resolution” on
                            membership.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> thought Canadians had
                            taken care to consult us. He cited speech he had made in Parliament some
                            months ago in which he declared if admission of Outer Mongolia price
                            that had to be paid for admission other eligible countries he thought
                            price not too high. Canada had all along Outer Mongolia in mind as part
                            of package deal and he believed State Department had been kept currently
                            informed, as had <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> Delegation.
                                <persName>Martin</persName> of Canadian <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Delegation had done no more nor less than carry out
                            policy of his government and <persName corresp="#p_PLB1"
                                >Pearson</persName> had no complaints re his tactics. He conceded
                            that if they had known how strongly we felt on question they might not
                            have been so active. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> said
                            he particularly resented reports he had made deal with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> while in Moscow and denied it
                            emphatically.</p>
                        <p>I said that Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> and I are readily accessible to Canadian
                            Ambassador on matters of such importance as this. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> said he appreciated this. While
                            not apologizing for Canada’s action he said that henceforth Canada would
                            not fail to exchange views on all important matters at a high level and
                            he expressed hope misunderstandings such as this would not recur.<note

                                the membership issue that had divided the two countries was closed
                                and that both countries had learned a lesson on the need for closer
                                cooperation. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> agreed
                                and the two men then turned to a discussion of other matters.

                            cover in detail the numerous telegraphic exchanges between Washington
                            and Taipei in this connection. Rather, it endeavors to fill in certain
                            gaps which may help in an understanding of the position taken by the
                            Chinese. Their actions were based in considerable part upon a belief
                            that, in this case, much had been done by other countries without
                            consulting the Government of the Republic of China. In retrospect this
                            feature may seem of secondary importance, but during a period when
                            events are moving rapidly, what information is currently available and
                            what is believed to be true at the time may be more significant than
                            actual facts which become known only after decisions have been taken and
                            acted upon.</p>
                        <p>On November 11 the Canadian representative at the United Nations,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MP1">Paul Martin</persName>, reportedly told
                                <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">T.F. Tsiang</persName> about the
                            18-nation membership “package”. <persName corresp="#p_TTF1"
                                >Tsiang</persName> understood that a deal had been made in Moscow
                            last October by <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>. The latter then
                            appears to have obtained Whitehall’s blessing and to have turned the
                            project over to his United Nations representative for implementation.
                                <persName>Martin</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_TTF1"
                                >Tsiang</persName> that 25 nations would back the scheme, which led
                            the Government in Taipei to assume that the United States must have been
                            privy to it. <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName> informed
                                <persName>Martin</persName> that his standing instructions to veto
                            Outer Mongolia “if necessary” were so definite as to require no removal,
                            but that he would ask Taipei about the other satellites concerned.</p>
                        <p>Two days later, on November 13, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"

                            included the assertion, “it is obvious that Outer Mongolia cannot make
                            the grade,” with reference to the latter’s application for United
                            Nations membership. On November 16, the Japanese Ambassador at Taipei
                            called on the American Ambassador to say that he was under instructions
                            to see the Chinese Foreign Minister about the possibility of a veto of

                        <p>On November 23, three “niact” telegrams arrived in the Embassy from the
                            Department, the first two of which were personal messages from President

                            Chiang and strongly advising against a veto of Outer Mongolia. The
                            President was about to leave Taipei for Sun Moon Lake for a few days
                            rest, but through the Foreign Minister the two messages were translated
                            to him on the day they arrived; he left <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465"
                                facs="0491"/>Taipei on the morning of November 24. President Chiang
                            remained at Sun Moon Lake until December 14, when he returned to Taipei
                            in order to receive Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker. During this
                            period numerous telegrams were received by the Embassy from the
                            Department dealing with the present subject. These messages were
                            discussed in detail with the Chinese Foreign Minister, whom the American
                            Ambassador saw nearly every day. The Minister, in turn, was in frequent
                            touch by telephone with the President regarding United Nations
                            developments, but evidence was not lacking that President Chiang
                            prolonged his holiday in order to avoid further direct involvement in
                            the matter of Outer Mongolia, and to meditate undisturbed on all of its
                            implications. The Foreign Minister’s initial reaction to the messages
                            from President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was telegraphed

                        <p>Through the Chinese Embassy in Washington, President Chiang replied on
                            November 25 to the two American messages.<note n="10" xml:id="d229fn10"

                            courteous and restrained, he was adamant in maintaining the position

                            United Nations. The Embassy at Taipei then telegraphed certain
                            suggestions to the Department (on November 28) as to how the Chinese
                            Government might be offered offsetting advantages which conceivably
                            would persuade it to forego the veto.</p>

                            the established policy of recent years, under which United
                            States-Chinese differences have been dealt with discreetly, was highly
                            annoying to the Foreign Minister and other Chinese. If anything, it
                            further stiffened their position (Embassy Taipei’s telegram of November

                            Foreign Minister intimated that if the American Ambassador wished,
                            President Chiang would see him at Sun Moon Lake. The next morning, the

                            three hours with President and Madame Chiang, and returned to Taipei the
                            same day. The conversation was summarized in a telegram to the
                            Department that evening (a more detailed Memorandum of Conversation is

                            countries out of the original package, brought measurable relief to the
                            Chinese Government in its difficult position.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It may be noted that from the Chinese
                            standpoint most of the factors which might have permitted a change of
                            front were lacking in this case. These missing ingredients included (1)
                            early information on the precise nature of the “package deal”, with
                            consequent lack of time to prepare public and official opinion for a
                            possible shift of position, (2) a quid pro quo, which is so essential to
                            a small, weak nation when it is called upon to make a sacrifice, (3) any
                            threat of sanctions other than eventual ejection from the United
                            Nations, which the Chinese have come to regard as almost inevitable in
                            any case, (4) any “out”, or “steps to come down” as the Chinese say,
                            which might have saved face for them in the absence of either carrot or
                            stick. In brief, the Chinese took what they regarded as a sound moral
                            (and legal) position, which happened to coincide with their previous
                            policy and basic inclinations; in this they were impelled by a horror of
                            taking any action which might appear as weakness in the eyes of their
                            own public or of the world at large. Only the strong are likely to feel
                            that they can afford the luxury of yielding unless actually forced to do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>Throughout this episode matters were made increasingly difficult by
                            excessive publicity, including strenuous efforts by the world press to
                            publish all of the news before it happened. Moreover, the atmosphere was
                            clouded by Chinese suspicion that the United States and others had made
                            a deal behind their backs. The Department’s categorical denial (telegram
                            of December 4<note n="16" xml:id="d229fn16">Not further

                            and repeated subsequently. This was received with incredulity, which
                            appears to have persisted until December 14, when the Foreign Minister
                            told the Legislative Yuan that the United States “did not learn about
                            the package deal very much earlier than we.” Until that time, it had
                            been inconceivable to the Chinese that the Canadians (and British) could
                            have made a deal in October about which the United States was not
                            informed until about November 22. While not accusing the United States
                            directly of <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0493"/>having reached an
                            understanding with other countries, while not informing China, President
                            Chiang on December 8 described the package deal as a British project,
                            with the clear implication that perfidious Albion was once more leading
                            the United States down the primrose path toward acceptance of the
                            Peiping regime and a consequent “solution of the problem of Taiwan.”
                            Soviet insistence on Outer Mongolia in the present instance was regarded
                            in the Taipei Foreign Ministry primarily as a move to facilitate
                            Peiping’s entry into the United Nations. The Red maneuver would seem to
                            have been calculated to further this purpose whether the Government of
                            the Republic of China abstained or vetoed. Accepting their eventual
                            ejection from the United Nations as almost inevitable in view of
                            existing trends, therefore, the Chinese Government felt compelled to
                            take the course of resistance rather than acquiescence.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said that he
                            wished to make clear the American position with reference to Chinese
                            representation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at this time. He
                            stated that sentiment in the country and in Congress was overwhelmingly
                            against the admission of Red China and that under present circumstances
                            he, himself, shared this view. The Communists were still aggressors in
                            Korea, they had tortured our prisoners, had thrown our Nationals into
                            jail without trial and were still holding Americans in prison in
                            violation of their commitment to release them. In international
                            relations, the Red Chinese had violated all the decencies supposed to
                            exist between civilized nations and so long as they remained as they
                            were, he would be opposed to their admission to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. If and when they changed, he, at least,
                            would be willing to take another look but even then he would still have
                            a difficult public relations problem with the country at large. The
                            American people, said the President, were deeply resentful of the
                            140,000 casualties suffered in Korea and he referred to Chou En-lai’s
                            recent statement threatening to take Formosa by force, adding that if
                            Red China were voted into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, it
                            would not be thirty minutes before a resolution would be introduced upon
                            the floor of the Senate for the US to get out… . Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reminded that in the past the
                            period covered had been the calendar year. He pointed out that the 11th
                            Session might not begin until November which would mean that sessions
                            would be continued into 1957. He, therefore, suggested that the new
                            moratorium cover the entire period of the session rather than the
                            calendar year 1956 in order to avoid having to bring up the question
                            again in the middle of the session.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> referred
                            again to US opposition. He pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Charter required members to be “peace loving”. The Red
                            Chinese, he said, were still branded as aggressors by <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution; they still had troops in
                            North Korea in defiance of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            they should not be allowed to shoot their way into membership.</p>

                            <item>There is evidence that the British are seeking to persuade
                                European representatives here of their view that the 11th <gloss

                                grounds that in September it will be easier for the British Cabinet
                                to agree on a moratorium on Chinese representation than it would be
                                in November. This is on the grounds that British Cabinet can give as
                                its excuse the fact of US elections.</item>

                            <item>The trouble with this argument is that it is implicit in all these
                                conversations that the moratorium would not extend beyond the
                                calendar year 1956. Inasmuch as the 11th <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                    >GA</gloss> would inescapably go over into January and possibly
                                February of 1957, regardless of when it starts, a moratorium that
                                extends only through 1956 is virtually worthless.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>What we should have is a moratorium which covers the whole term of
                                the 11th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and a starting date after
                                US elections, not only because of Chinese question but also because
                                of the fact that Cyprus could also embitter Anglo-American
                                relations.</item>

                            <item>If we are not to have this, I would rather fight the substantive
                                question here on the floor. As I envisage it, this would have to
                                involve initially a motion by a supporter of <gloss
                                    target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s to declare the China seat
                                vacant. This would require a two-thirds vote and if we cannot get a
                                blocking third on an issue of that kind after the election we
                                certainly ought to know it. I think we could get enough votes,
                                allowing for abstention of those who, while not agreeing with us,
                                would abstain in order to prevent split of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss>. Am also sure we would be enthusiastically supported
                                by our own public opinion.</item>

                            strong position the President had taken in opposition to the Chinese
                            Communists. He asked if it were true that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> had promised to consult with other members of the
                            cabinet upon his return to London with a view to insuring the continued
                            exclusion of the Chinese Communists from the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> had not promised anything. The President had stated
                            in the most unequivocal terms the unqualified opposition of the United
                            States to the admission of Communist China to the United Nations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had simply said that his
                            Government would carefully consider the possibility of continued British
                            support for the present “moratorium” arrangement in the United Nations,
                            and let us know the decision as soon as possible. We have not heard
                            anything from London yet. The President’s strong statement as to the
                            unacceptability of Communist China was made to the full British
                            delegation and left them in no doubt where the United States stood on
                            this question.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked if the
                            proposed arrangement was the same as before.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said this was correct. It was only the
                            strong stand of the United States which made this arrangement
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that various
                            countries which had been friendly now seemed to be receptive to the
                            admission of Communist China. This made the position more difficult.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> said the situation had been more
                            difficult ever since the Chinese Government’s veto of the membership
                            application of Outer Mongolia. Notwithstanding the difficulties of
                            holding the line, the United States is adamant in its stand against
                            Communist China. The United States is absolutely firm on this. There has
                            been <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0497"/>no wavering at any time.
                            Both the Republican and Democratic parties are solid on this issue. It

                            Embassy recalled Secretary’s conversation with <persName

                            subject which bi-partisan in nature, and stated that, whereas there was
                            no question of urgency, it seemed time that UK gave serious
                            consideration to question. Embassy expressed assumption that UKG would
                            doubtless agree to moratorium for duration of session.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> representative stated that
                            issue had lain dormant since <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            talks and that it had not yet been referred to Ministers, but he agreed
                            that it was time active consideration be given to problem. He said that
                            issue basically political and not one for decision by <gloss
                                target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>. There seems to be some feeling
                            that, whereas UKG might acquiesce in moratorium for balance of calendar
                            year, Ministers might well hesitate acquiesce for entire session which
                            conceivably could extend well into 1957.</p>
                        <p>For <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>’s consideration Embassy
                            suggests that approach outlined <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                                >reftel</gloss> might be modified in future conversations to improve
                            negotiating position with British on this issue. We have in mind that
                            completely open-ended inquiries as to status British consideration
                            problem tend to facilitate British injection conditions etc. More
                            promising approach would seem to us to be to imply that there can be
                            little if any question of Brit going along with US in continuing
                            moratorium given importance to Brit of maintaining global US-UK
                            solidarity and that, in assuming their concurrence on continuance, we
                            should concentrate on obtaining decision appropriate tactics for

                            would abstain from voting on the resolution, and perhaps the UK decision
                            to support the moratorium for the whole <gloss target="#t_GA1"

                        <p>It was agreed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"

                            their continued exclusion from the U.N.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office has also informed Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> that it is thinking in terms of
                            a broad co-sponsorship of Japan’s application, which would include
                            Australia, Iran, Peru, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and
                            asked what the U.S. reaction would be to the inclusion of the <gloss

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> on his own
                            volition had the Foreign Office <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0502"
                            />informed that we would consider Soviet co-sponsorship “an insult after
                            all that has transpired.” I nevertheless believe that we should be
                            prepared to accept Soviet co-sponsorship if this is necessary to ensure
                            favorable Security Council action on the Japanese application.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Robertson, when he sees Premier Hatoyama in New York on October 25
                            and 26, will reaffirm the United States strong support of Japan’s
                            membership application. He will also express the Department’s continuing
                            desire to be of assistance and willingness to request Security Council
                            reconsideration of the Japanese application whenever Japan so

                                “confirmed our fears” that Japan “obtained little in the way of
                                concessions in their negotiations with the Russians. They hope that
                                the Russians will support their application for <gloss

                                due to the fact that the Russians refused to use the word
                                ‘unconditional’ in describing their support. For this reason the
                                Japanese do not wish to have the question of their admission

                                the Prime Minister that the United States wished to extend all

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HADP1">Heeney</persName> remarked that
                            the State Department was undoubtedly well aware of the somewhat
                            different emphasis which the Canadian Government placed on the question
                            of Communist Chinese representation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and the general recognition of that country. He simply
                            wanted to say that, despite the somewhat different viewpoint held by
                            Canada, the Canadian Government was prepared to support the “moratorium”
                            procedure at the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador pointed out, however, that the ability of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members to renew the moratorium might
                            become very much more difficult next year. He said it was hard to
                            overlook the fact that such a large portion of the world’s population
                            was being excluded from the precincts of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and thereby deprived of the useful influence which that
                            body was established to foster. Consequently, the present notice of
                            Canadian support for a moratorium should not be taken to imply an
                            indefinite projection of policy that would be adhered to in any and all
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> thanked the Ambassador for his notice
                            of support and mentioned that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>
                            had likewise informed us that it would support the moratorium procedure.
                            Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> then took the opportunity to remind
                            the Ambassador of the intensity of U.S. opposition to the seating of the
                            Communist Chinese. Congress had made its position unmistakably clear in
                            recent months through a series of resolutions and riders to bills in the
                            course of its sessions. There are probably a number of Congressmen who
                            do not have very definite opinions concerning the matter but the
                            unanimity marking Congressional action shows quite definitely that the
                            legislators are reflecting a popular determination. He commented that
                            highly placed officials from other countries did not always seem to
                            appreciate fully <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0504"/>the firmness
                            of U.S. opinion. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HADP1"
                                >Heeney</persName> referred to the planks in both parties’ platforms
                            and said that it was his impression that U.S. opinion with regard to the
                            Chinese Communists had hardened rather than softened during the past six
                            months and that he had so reported to his government in Ottawa. He
                            mentioned also the President’s conversation with Prime Minister St.
                            Laurent at White Sulphur Springs last March and commented that his Prime
                            Minister had apparently for the first time realized the strength of the
                            U.S. position on this question. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HADP1"
                                >Heeney</persName> gave assurance that he now well understood the
                            U.S. position. He had simply wished to remind us that situations change
                            with world events and that Canada could not regard itself as
                            pre-committed to any specific attitude over an indefinite period.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> asked hypothetically, how, in view of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution naming the Chinese Communists
                            as an aggressor, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could find it
                            procedurally feasible to admit representation from that regime. The
                            Ambassador said that he had not thought through the technicalities of
                            the situation. He thought, however, that the U.S. might find itself
                            confronted at the General Assembly a year hence with a growing demand on
                            the part of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members to seat the
                            Chinese Communists and wondered what the U.S. would intend to do in that
                            situation. Mr. <persName>Robertson</persName> referred to the
                            President’s statement to the British Prime Minister last January with
                            regard to anticipated Congressional reaction to the seating of the
                            Chinese Communists and said that he thought in this situation other
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members would have to decide
                            whether they preferred U.S. participation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> or Chinese Communist participation. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HADP1">Heeney</persName> replied that of course there
                            was no question on Canada’s decision in such a choice.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then asked whether any information was available
                            concerning Soviet plans with regard to Japanese admission into the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Mr.
                                <persName>Robertson</persName> replied that the Japanese, on the
                            basis of carefully recorded minutes, believe that they have a commitment
                            from the Soviets not to veto their application. The Japanese, however,
                            are somewhat worried by a remark by Soviet representatives that it was
                            not possible to say whether or not some other country would invoke a
                            veto. All in all it is believed that the Russians will not actively
                            oppose the Japanese case per se. The Japanese unfortunately are in a
                            basically difficult situation vis-à-vis the Russians since the agreement
                            signed at Moscow on October 19 has still to be ratified. The Japanese
                            Government does not wish to have the Japanese membership application
                            brought up in the Security Council until this agreement has entered into
                            force for fear that the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>
                            might withhold the support promised in the agreement.</p>

                        <p>The difference of opinion between Japan and the <gloss

                            help the general situation. The agreement provides that the Habomais and
                            Shikotan will go to Japan, once a peace treaty is concluded, but the
                            agreement gives no indication of the date when negotiations for the
                            peace treaty are to be initiated. The agreement makes no mention of
                            Etorofu and Kunashiri, the islands which have been the main bone of
                            contention during the entire negotiation and there is every indication
                            that the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> will make
                            conclusion of the peace treaty contingent upon Japan’s recognition of

                        <p>Three applicants have been recommended for United Nations membership by
                            the Security Council since the Tenth Session of the General Assembly—the
                            Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia. These three states were admitted without
                            difficulty at the opening plenary of the Eleventh Session.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d239fn2">On November 12, at the first plenary meeting of its
                                Eleventh Session, the General Assembly unanimously adopted three
                                separate draft resolutions, submitted by 23 nations, admitting the
                                Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia, respectively, to membership.</note></p>
                        <p>Three other applicants found qualified for admission to the United
                            Nations by the General Assembly remain outside the Organization because
                            of Soviet vetos in the Security Council. These are Japan, the Republic
                            of Korea, and Viet-Nam. A fourth applicant, Outer Mongolia, has never
                            received the separate endorsement of the General Assembly, although it
                            was included in the membership <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0506"
                            />“package” proposal adopted by the Assembly in 1955. It has never been
                            recommended for admission by the Security Council. The United States
                            considers Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Viet-Nam well qualified for
                            membership and has urged their admission. We oppose the admission of
                            Outer Mongolia, which we do not regard as an independent state. Outer
                            Mongolia has recently renewed its application, and the USSR may again
                            tie its admission to that of Japan. It may also seek to link the
                            admission of the Republic of Korea and of Viet-Nam with the admission of
                            the Viet Minh and North Korean regimes.</p>

                                Assembly’s previous endorsements of the Japanese candidacy and

                                should then consult the Department on whether the United States
                                should take the initiative toward co-sponsoring a suitable
                                resolution; otherwise the United States should limit itself to
                                making clear, in an appropriate statement under this item, its

                        <p>Under Article 4(2) of the United Nations Charter, new members are
                            admitted to the United Nations by decision of the General Assembly on
                            the recommendation of the Security Council. Soviet vetoes in the
                            Security Council prevented the admission of any new members from 1950
                            until 1955, when during the Tenth General Assembly sixteen new members
                            were admitted. The USSR, however, again vetoed the applications of three
                            states previously found qualified for membership by the General
                            Assembly—Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Since the Tenth Session of the Assembly, the Security Council has acted
                            favorably on the applications of three newly independent states—the
                            Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia. These states were admitted at the opening
                            plenary of the Eleventh Session.</p>
                        <p>The recent agreement between Japan and the USSR states that the “<gloss
                                target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> will support Japan’s request
                            for admission to membership in the United Nations,” but this commitment
                            does not appear to become effective until ratifications have been
                            exchanged. Japan has indicated that it does not desire Security Council
                            consideration of its application before this exchange can take place.
                            Therefore the addition of Japan to the group of states being admitted
                            under Item 5 appears to be precluded by the fact that the Japanese Diet
                            is not scheduled to meet to consider the agreement until November 12.
                            There is, however, a second agenda item on the admission of new Members,
                            and the Assembly can act at any time to admit Japan pursuant to a
                            Security Council recommendation.</p>
                        <p>In the Security Council in 1955 after an 18 member package failed of
                            adoption following Soviet vetoes of free world candidates and a Chinese
                            veto of Outer Mongolia, a 16 member package which did not include Japan
                            and Outer Mongolia was approved. At that time the <gloss
                                target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> delegate voiced “the

                            General Assembly”. The <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>
                            vetoed a United States proposal recommending Japan’s admission and a
                            subsequent United States proposal recommending Japan’s admission at the
                            11th General Assembly. A Soviet proposal recommending both Japan and
                            Outer Mongolia for admission at the 11th General Assembly then failed of
                            adoption with only the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>
                            voting affirmatively and all other Council members abstaining. The
                                <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> had also vetoed Korea
                            and Viet-Nam. We cannot be sure that the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1"
                                >U.S.S.R.</gloss> may not connect the Japanese application with
                            Outer Mongolia in some form.</p>
                        <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0508"/>
                        <p>If the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> should again veto
                            the Japanese application, despite any commitment of support, the United
                            States should be prepared to take the necessary initiative to obtain a
                            reaffirmation by the Assembly of its findings that Japan is qualified
                            for membership and should promptly be admitted. Since there is
                            widespread support among United Nations Members for Japan’s admission,
                            an Assembly resolution to this effect would serve to underscore Soviet
                            responsibility for its continued exclusion and to keep pressure on the
                                <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> However, in view of
                            the importance attached to United Nations membership by both the
                            Government and the people of Japan, the United States should, before
                            taking such an initiative, consult with Japan and should only proceed if
                            Japan concurs. Otherwise, a United States initiative might be
                            prejudicial to United States-Japanese relations.</p>
                        <p>The Republic of Korea has been pressing for renewed consideration of its
                            application, and the Republic of Viet-Nam also, though to a lesser
                            extent, is eager for admission to the United Nations, and regardless of
                            the status of the Japanese application, a reaffirmation of United States
                            support of their candidacies as early as possible is desirable. However,
                            so long as the Republic of Korea and Viet-Nam continue to be divided
                            states, another Soviet veto in the Security Council appears inevitable,
                            and it was the majority view at the Tenth General Assembly that under
                            these circumstances their applications should not be pressed. This may
                            well be the view of the Eleventh Session also. Refusal of the United
                            States to be guided by the consensus would be badly received under the
                            circumstances as divisive rather than constructive in intent. Moreover,
                            such an item would open the way for consideration of Outer Mongolia’s
                            application and for the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>
                            possibly to raise the questions of the North Korean and Viet Minh
                            regimes.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, Korea and to a lesser extent Viet-Nam, attach
                            considerable importance to General Assembly consideration of their
                            membership applications and the political consequences of a failure by
                            the General Assembly to discuss the applications would have to be
                            carefully considered.</p>
                        <p>The decision whether the United States should take the initiative in
                            looking toward reaffirmation by the Assembly of its finding that both
                            the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Viet-Nam are qualified for
                            membership should be taken in the light of the degree of support among
                            United Nations members generally and of the wishes of the Korean and
                            Vietnamese Governments.</p>
                        <p>The United States is opposed to the admission of Outer Mongolia. However,
                            in 1955 the United States abstained first in the General Assembly on the
                            “package” proposal which included Outer Mongolia and then in the
                            Security Council votes on Outer Mongolia, in <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483"
                                facs="0509"/>accordance with the spirit of the 1948 <persName
                                corresp="#p_VAH1">Vandenberg</persName> Resolution calling for
                            voluntary agreement among the permanent members of the Security Council
                            to remove the veto from the admission of new Members. Since the last
                            General Assembly, we have consistently and successfully opposed the
                            admission of Outer Mongolia to other organizations and agencies. The
                            deadlock on the admission of new members to the United Nations no longer
                            presents a serious problem, and it should be possible to assure that any
                            Assembly consideration of Outer Mongolia’s application this year is not
                            tied in with its consideration of other applications. Forthright
                            opposition to Outer Mongolia at this Assembly is consistent with the
                            position we have taken in other organizations and with our well-known
                            views on this subject, and does not require us to shift from an
                            abstention in the Security Council consistent with the <persName
                                corresp="#p_VAH1">Vandenberg</persName> Resolution. Moreover, it is
                            to our interest to make clear our firm opposition to Outer Mongolia with
                            a view to forestalling the build-up of pressures that might again lead
                            to a Chinese veto of Outer Mongolia in the Security Council. As China
                            exercised its veto last year under circumstances in which its United
                            Nations position was involved and despite appeals from the President and
                            the Secretary, we can definitely anticipate that China will again veto
                            Outer Mongolia if that candidacy should receive seven affirmative votes

                        <p>Ambassador Yang called at his request to reaffirm his Government’s strong

                            importance of the U.S. taking the lead so that world opinion can focus
                            on the right of the Republic of Korea, in light of its special
                            relationships to the U.N., to membership in the Organization. Ambassador
                            Yang underscored that the Assembly at this time is particularly
                            favorable to a U.S. initiative.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> emphasized the
                            continued strong support of the U.S. of the Republic of Korea for
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He pointed up the
                            importance of not taking any step in the Assembly, unless careful
                            consultations indicate that there will be at least as much support for
                            the Korean application at this time as there has been in the past. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> added that the U.S.
                            would give careful consideration to the request made by Ambassador
                            Yang.</p>

                            disturb you last Wednesday with the question of Outer Mongolia in the
                            Security Council, but I had no choice because of the last minute word I
                            received to change the United States position, when I left my arduous
                            negotiations on the “condemnation” resolution to rush out to the
                            Security Council for the election of Japan.</p>

                            Security Council action in early December. Even before that, on October
                            19th, I raised with <persName corresp="#p_KT1">Kase</persName> the
                            question of how Outer Mongolia was to be handled and reported this to
                            the Department in <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> telegram

                                    >Ibid.,</hi> 310.2/10–1956)</note> On December 8th, we notified
                            the Department that the Russians had put in a separate item on Outer
                            Mongolia. The Position Paper on the Admission of New Members (US/<gloss
                                target="#t_A1">A</gloss> / 3766), November 26, 1956, contains this
                            sentence: “Forthright opposition to Outer Mongolia at this Assembly is
                            consistent with the position we have taken in other organizations and
                            with our well-known views on this subject, and does not require us to
                            shift from an abstention in the Security Council consistent with the
                                <persName corresp="#p_VAH1">Vandenberg</persName> Resolution.”</p>
                        <p>I understand that the Department had been considering a change in this
                            position for some time before last Wednesday, but that for reasons on
                            which I am not informed, it proved impossible to get instructions to us
                            until we were called on the phone on the morning of the 12th. No one
                            would have been happier than I to vote against Outer Mongolia, but in
                            the absence of instructions to the contrary, everyone here assumed that
                            we would follow the same tactics that we followed last year. Had a firm
                            decision been taken to vote “no” on Outer Mongolia, it would have been
                            necessary for us to explain to the other members why we were making the
                            change. We could have easily done this if we had been given a day or two
                            advance notice.</p>
                        <p>You are always so good natured that I am sorry when anything arises which
                            creates difficulty for you. I am sure, however, that if I had made a
                            last-minute change of tactics on Outer Mongolia, it would not have been
                            understood and would have caused a great deal <pb n="486"
                                xml:id="pg_486" facs="0512"/>of adverse comment here. As it is, we
                            have done what was expected of us and nobody is under the impression
                            that we are lukewarm or uncertain in our opposition to the Outer
                            Mongolian application. And we can still change our position to a “no” if
                            that is what the Department decides it wants to do.</p>

                                >Cabot</persName></hi>: I fully share your regret at the confusion
                            that ensued over the Outer Mongolia vote last Wednesday. We were, of
                            course, aware that this item was on the agenda, but assumed until Monday
                            morning that no further guidance to you was necessary. This assumption
                            was based on the belief that the Secretary’s decision of last year with
                            respect to this matter still held, since no change in policy was
                            suggested when the position paper you refer to in your letter was
                            cleared with all the interested areas in the Department. A change in
                            position was not suggested until Monday morning at the Secretary’s staff
                            meeting, and no Departmental position could be reached on this
                            suggestion until Wednesday morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2"><p>At
                                    the Secretary’s Staff Meeting on December 13, it was reported
                                    that Outer Mongolia’s application for membership had not been
                                    accepted by the Security Council because of five abstentions
                                    including that of the United States. “Mr. <persName

                                    Mongolia, but, after communicating with Ambassador <persName

                                    had promised other Delegations that the U.S. would abstain and
                                    could not at that late hour withdraw from that commitment.

                                    explained he was following the policy set forth in the <persName

                            were Austria, India, Denmark, Afghanistan, Egypt. Sudan indicated
                            probable abstentions. Tunisia and Burma indicated no instructions and
                            Norway that it hoped issue would not be pressed.</p>
                        <p>On basis tally so far we think <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would
                            get two-thirds vote with solid <gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss>
                            support, most of Europe, and scattered Afro-Asian votes, probably along
                            lines vote on hearing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in first

                            and Yemen. Our guess is that North Korea would also be rejected <pb
                                n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0515"/>by vote roughly like that
                            against it in first committee, i.e., about 40–20.</p>
                        <p>Voting on South Vietnam less certain. Canada indicated they faced problem
                            because of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> membership; Italy stated
                            position not clear but would probably support US; Portugal said had
                            assumed divided countries would not be pressed; Greece, Egypt,
                            Afghanistan and Sudan thought might abstain; Mexico would abstain
                            although other <gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss>s would vote yes;
                            Denmark and Austria would vote no. While two-thirds majority possible on
                            South Vietnam it would be weaker than for <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> and might only be achieved because of number of
                            abstentions and possibly without support several Western countries. Vote
                            on North Vietnam would fail of two-thirds support, again probably with
                            large number of abstentions.</p>
                        <p>USSR has indicated to Mexicans they would introduce <gloss
                                target="#t_res1">Res</gloss> on Outer Mongolia if <gloss
                                target="#t_res1">Res</gloss> on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            introduced but would be willing see no action taken otherwise.</p>
                        <p>In summary, we could probably obtain good majority on <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and weaker one on South Vietnam, with
                            votes against North Korea and North Vietnam being satisfactory but not
                            too strong.</p>
                        <p>Aside from this voting check, there is considerable reluctance to take
                            question up at all. UK continues urge against pressing issue, as do
                            Denmark and Norway, with general lack enthusiasm also shown by other
                            friendly dels. Secretariat has prepared paper for possible use <persName

                                >GA</gloss> that committee has no recommendation to submit on this
                            issue. This is based on their sense of situation and not, of course,
                            intended to be used if we decide to press issue.</p>
                        <p>We think that question initiative on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            should be considered in connection Vietnam and Outer Mongolia and that
                            initiative on one may result in consideration of all.</p>
                        <p>It would be appreciated if we could have Department’s decision by
                            Thursday so that we may inform Secretariat and friendly dels before

                            of Viet-Nam, I protest to the Security Council against the resolution
                            adopted by the General Assembly on 28 February 1957 recommending to the
                            Security Council that South Viet-Nam should be admitted to membership in
                            the United Nations. This recommendation, which was made at the proposal
                            of the United States and certain other countries, constitutes a
                            violation of the Geneva agreements consecrating the principle of the
                            unity of Viet-Nam. Since Viet-Nam is an indivisible whole, South
                            Viet-Nam cannot be considered as a separate State nor be admitted as
                            such to the United Nations. Moreover, the recommendation is contrary to
                            the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth session to
                            the effect that the admission of temporarily divided countries should
                            not be considered. I call upon the Security Council to reject the
                            recommendation of the General Assembly and to refuse the admission of
                            South Viet-Nam to the United Nations.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the message addressed on 13 March 1957 to the President

                                xml:id="pg_499" facs="0525"/>behalf of the so-called Democratic
                            Republic of Viet-Nam, protesting against the General Assembly resolution
                            of 28 February 1957, recommending the admission of Viet-Nam to
                            membership in the United Nations, a message which you transmitted to me,
                            I should be grateful if you would forward to the President of the
                            Security Council the following communication:</p>
                        <p>The Government of the Republic of Viet-Nam has the honour to draw the
                            attention of the President and members of the Security Council to the
                            fact that it legally represents the entire territory of Viet-Nam,
                            including the area occupied by the de facto Viet-Minh authorities. The
                            instrument known as the Geneva “Agreement on the Cessation of
                            Hostilities in Viet-Nam” signed on 21 July 1954 by the French and
                            Viet-Minh High Commands, cannot in international law affect the legal
                            position of Viet-Nam, which remains the same single State that, through
                            the referendum of 23 October 1956, became the Republic of Viet-Nam. That
                            change in the constitutional status of the country is not a factor which
                            can affect the principle of the continuity of the State.</p>
                        <p>Hence, having examined the application for admission submitted by
                            Viet-Nam, the United Nations General Assembly, in its resolution of 28
                            February 1957, requested the Security Council to reconsider the
                            application of Viet-Nam, and not of “South Viet-Nam”, as Mr. Pham Van
                            Dong incorrectly expressed it. The Government of the Republic of
                            Viet-Nam accordingly requests the Security Council to reject outright
                            the protest made by the de facto Viet-Minh authorities and to give
                            effect to the recommendation of the United Nations General
                                Assembly.<note n="2" xml:id="d256fn2">On May 23, Nguyen Duy Lien,

                                government’s information and requested our comment on the likelihood

                                    >Cabot</persName></hi>: As you know, I was one of the four
                            delegates who went to Ghana with the Vice President. You know also that
                            in 1955 I took three specialists with me on a long trip in 24 countries
                            of Africa. You have had the report I submitted on that study trip. Since
                            then various departments and bureaus have taken an increasing interest
                            in that great Continent and the people who live there. More and more
                            people will be going to Africa and little by little we shall know more
                            about the hopes and fears, the dreams and the aspirations of the
                            Africans.</p>
                        <p>That the United Nations saw fit to take Ghana into its membership before
                            it was 24 hours old, highlights what is to me a serious situation,
                            particularly for the United States and the other major countries.
                            Without question the “Asian Bloc” is in control and we shall be finding
                            ourselves more and more at the mercy of small countries too new to
                            responsibility to be able to act for the general benefit of a free
                            world.</p>
                        <p>Why should there not have been set up a trial period for all “emerging”
                            countries?</p>
                        <p>When one sees the tragic mistakes being made by Nkrumah, one trembles for
                            him and his country. They may seem but small matters, such as his face
                            on a stamp, the taking over of Christians-borg Castle, his dismissal of
                            Gbedemah, the best financial brain in Ghana, because he refused to mint
                            coins with Nkrumah’s face on them, etc., but they are clear indications
                            that he is developing delusions of grandeur that may well wreck his own
                            country and the chances of other countries for their freedom.</p>
                        <p>My experience at the United Nations is still too vivid for me to have
                            forgotten the problems with which you are surrounded. Perhaps because of
                            this I felt I must give you my sense of it all.</p>
                        <p>My warm regards to you and that charming wife of yours, and always my
                            appreciation.</p>
                        <p>Cordially yours,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Frances</hi>: Many thanks for your letter of
                            June 6, and for the comments you made on the role of African nations. I
                            share your fears as to the dangers involved in loading the burdens of
                            international responsibility of the kind required by the United Nations
                            upon those not yet ready for them.</p>
                        <p>But if the State is independent, well-established countries should help
                            in the maturing process and the United Nations is one place where this
                            can be done.</p>
                        <p>I am not pessimistic regarding the influence of the Asian and African
                            countries in the United Nations. The United States continues to occupy a
                            unique position, which is not subordinate to any “bloc”. This was most
                            recently demonstrated during the recent Suez difficulties. Moreover, the
                            Asian-African nations are so diverse that there appears little
                            likelihood that they will ever constitute a solid voting bloc. This too
                            has already been demonstrated at the last General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Your suggestion of a trial period is interesting and I will study it
                            myself and will also transmit your thoughts to the Department of State
                            where, coming from you, they are automatically guaranteed the fullest
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>Emily joins me in sending you our warmest regards.</p>

                        <p>The approach of June 12 mentioned by Ambassador <persName

                            moratorium to cover the entire duration of the 12th General
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The British have given us several indications that they will continue at
                            the 12th General Assembly to support us on the Chinese representation
                            issue, but have not yet given us a specific commitment. In informing
                            Embassy London on July 25 that the United Kingdom would adhere to the
                            moratorium at the <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss> Conference, the
                            Foreign Office asked that this position be kept confidential until

                            taken at the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Embassy London was informed by the Foreign Office on August 8 (<gloss

                            <p>Mr. President,</p>
                            <p>The United States and many of those who share our views about this
                                matter have avoided any discussion of substance, but there has been
                                so much said about substance that, under the right of reply, I wish
                                to speak very briefly about that.</p>
                            <p>The argument that has been made by those who wish to inscribe this
                                item about the representation of China boils down to the one word
                                “realism”. In other words, no matter how much you like it or dislike
                                it there it is, and that ought to be enough.</p>
                            <p>Well, I think that it is true insofar as internal affairs go. It is
                                none of our affair here in the United Nations whether the internal
                                administration of a country is Marxian communist or Soviet
                                communist, whether it is liberty loving believers in social welfare
                                or dictatorial socialists, whether it is competitive capitalism for
                                a great many or monopoly capitalism for a few, or whether it is a
                                mixture of all those things. That is not our business here.</p>
                            <p>But the question of what they do when they try to spread across their
                                borders is another matter.</p>
                            <p>We may question, too, how “realistic” the current realism about
                                Communist China is. When one reads the reports of large numbers of
                                refugees streaming into Hong Kong, one remembers Mr. Quisling and
                                the other puppets who governed Europe under Hitler. That makes you
                                remember that the world is in a state of evolution, and that if
                                there is one state of mind which one should not have in 1957 it is a
                                fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability of things.</p>
                            <p>But, Mr. President, even if this judgment about the Chinese
                                communists is realistic, let me point out that the United Nations is
                                an organization that is not engaged in promoting realism. It is an
                                organization that has a moral standard. This hall here is not a mere
                                cockpit in which the criminal and the law-abiding are
                                indiscriminately scrambled up. The United Nations Charter says that
                                member states shall be “peace-loving”—“peace-loving”, that is the
                                word.</p>
                            <p>Now if some of us here think that this Assembly, this United Nations,
                                should become a cockpit in which the criminal and the law-abiding
                                are indiscriminately scrambled up—and they have a <pb n="509"
                                    xml:id="pg_509" facs="0535"/>right to that opinion—the thing for
                                them to do is to go and get an amendment to the Charter converting
                                the United Nations into that type of organization. They should go
                                ahead by amendment to promote their views. But they should not seek
                                to do it by nullification. That is what is involved in the
                                contemplation before us.</p>
                            <p>Now, the record shows abundantly that the Chinese communist regime is
                                not peace-loving. What they did in Korea, what they did in Viet-Nam,
                                what they have done in Tibet, what they have attempted in the
                                Philippines and in Formosa, and what they have tried to do in
                                Malaya—which was listened to when the Representative of Malaya spoke
                                of it with deserving respect—all prove beyond doubt that this
                                Chinese communist regime is not peace-loving. In fact, I don’t think
                                they themselves even pretend to be.</p>
                            <p>I think as the Representative of the United States you would all,
                                putting yourself in my position, understand that I make mention of
                                the fact that in the United Nations military action in Korea to
                                repel communist aggression there, we in the United States suffered
                                140,000 casualties, of which 35,000 were deaths, and that these were
                                almost all of them inflicted by the Chinese communists—and that is
                                something that it is only human for us to remember.</p>
                            <p>The fact is, Mr. President, that the United Nations itself officially
                                and formally and after due consideration branded the Chinese
                                communists aggressors in Korea. And it seems to me reasonable to
                                hold that the United Nations settled this issue when it took that
                                position. If it wants to unsettle it, let it repeal that decision.
                                That has never been done.</p>
                            <p>Now, Mr. President, before I take my seat, let me say that I speak as
                                a friend of the Chinese people, as one who admires the great soul of
                                the Chinese people, its steadfastness, its courage, its
                                individualism, its culture. I speak as the representative of a
                                country whose citizens have had wonderfully close and intimate
                                relations with the Chinese people ever since the beginning of the
                                United States of America.</p>
                            <p>We oppose this proposal not because of our disapproval of the
                                interior social system, not because the present regime was not
                                popularly elected, not because it came to power by violence, but
                                simply because to admit the Chinese communists would stultify the
                                United Nations and would thus destroy the usefulness of the United
                                Nations.</p>
                            <p>Feeling this way, it must be clear to all how devastatingly divisive
                                debate on this question would be and why, therefore, we urge our
                                colleagues to oppose the Indian amendment and to support the
                                American proposition.</p>

                            I saw [name deleted] this afternoon at 4:30 pm and strongly urged
                            desirability of Japanese co-sponsorship of both Vietnam and <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> resolutions. I said in light Japan’s
                            co-sponsorship both resolutions last year, failure to do so this year
                            might possibly be construed by some as change in Japan’s position with
                            unfortunate implications re Japanese position on Communism. If Japan
                            co-sponsored neither resolution it might also have (a) adverse effect on
                            Japanese reparations negotiations with Vietnam, and (b) make Koreans
                            even more intransigent and difficult. If Japan should only co-sponsor
                            Vietnam resolution, effect on Japan’s position might be damaging since
                            some might misconstrue it to mean that Japan using its new and important

                        <head>266. Editorial Note</head>
                        <p>On October 25, the United Nations General Assembly in plenary session
                            adopted a resolution sponsored by 13 nations, including the United
                            States, calling for the admission of the Republic of Korea to the United
                            Nations by a vote of 51 to 9 with 21 abstentions. A similar resolution
                            on Vietnam was adopted by a vote of 49 to 9 with 23 abstentions.</p>
                        <p>However, neither country was admitted to membership because of repeated
                            vetoes of membership resolutions in the Security Council by the Soviet
                            Union whose representatives argued that the Mongolian People’s Republic
                            and the Democratic Republic of North Korea also were deserving of
                            immediate membership as they fulfilled all of the qualifications set
                            forth in Article 4 of the United Nations Charter. The Soviet
                            Representative refused to accept the argument that the General Assembly
                            had recognized the Government of the Republic of Korea as the only
                            lawful government in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Thus, as a result of the Soviet vetoes in the Security Council, neither
                            the Republic of Korea nor Vietnam were admitted to United Nations
                            membership.</p>

                    <p>[Here follow a general introduction and sections dealing with the interests
                        of the United States and of Latin American countries concerning these
                        subjects and with the status of international discussion.]</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">United States Position</hi></p>
                    <p>The U.S. position on the entire subject must be considered with close
                        reference to the chain of events indicated above which cannot insofar as it
                        now seems possible be avoided, and which will have an important influence on
                        the final resolution of the problem if any international agreement is to be
                        reached.</p>
                    <p>Heretofore the United States has, insofar as Latin America is concerned,
                        largely confined its position on this subject to protesting acts or
                        declarations by other governments asserting claims to areas of the high sea
                        in excess of three miles, and to indicating its willingness to enter into
                        conversation agreements where U.S. fishing interests were directly
                        concerned. It is generally recognized that the protests have had little
                        effect on the tendency of these countries to continue to advance, and
                        attempt to enforce, their claims. Nor have projected conservation agreements
                        made much progress.</p>
                    <p>It has been suggested that the United States should take a firmer position,
                        and perhaps even exert economic or political pressure on other states to
                        induce them to change their position and <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514"
                            facs="0540"/>withdraw from excessive claims. Anyone familiar with Latin
                        American psychology will recognize that overt attempts by the United States
                        to force other states to back down from claims of sovereignty could only
                        have the effect of inflaming public opinion against the United States and
                        making it impossible for the Latin American governments affected so much as
                        to consider any deviation from their claims.</p>
                    <p>A course of action more likely to be effective is to seek international
                        agreement on the problem of territorial waters, continental shelf and
                        fisheries, with a view to accommodating the genuine interests of other
                        countries while at the same time protecting our interests as fully as
                        possible. A firm insistence on our own rights and expressions of serious
                        concern over the explosive potentialities of conflicts arising over the
                        freedom of the high seas would have a part in the negotiation of such
                        agreement. To accomplish any constructive results, however, the United
                        States would have to develop a position which would gain substantial support
                        from other American republics. The main elements in such a position would
                        probably have to include the following: <list>

                                limit which we have traditionally observed. It seems clear that only
                                a small minority of the Latin American countries would accept
                                confirmation of the three-mile limit, and viewing the world-wide
                                situation, it is equally clear that only a minority of nations would
                                support us to the end on this issue. The timing of any statement of
                                our willingness to abandon the three-mile limit would, of course, be

                                agreed amount, from fishermen of other nationalities as a means of
                                translating their economic interest into tangible return. Such a
                                right might be eliminated in the event the fishing activities of the
                                coastal state reached a predetermined minimum level.</item>

                    <p>The Commission prepared a provisional text for all but four of the articles
                        of the proposed draft and requested the comments of Governments on these
                        articles. Among the articles for which no text has yet been drafted is
                        Article 3 concerning the breadth of the territorial sea. With respect to
                        this article, the Commission requested views and suggestions which might
                        help it to formulate a concrete proposal.</p>
                    <p>So far as concerns the articles now drafted, the Government of the United
                        States believes that they constitute, as a whole, a sound exposition of the
                        principles applicable to the regime of the territorial sea in international
                        law. The Government of the United States has, however, certain suggestions
                        to make with respect to Articles 5 and 19.</p>
                    <p>Article 5 provides inter alia that where circumstances necessitate a special
                        regime because the coast is deeply indented or cut into “or because there
                        are islands in its immediate vicinity” the base line may be independent from
                        the low-water mark and may be a series of straight lines. The Government of
                        the United States presumes from the comments which follow the article that
                        it was not intended that the presence of a few isolated islands in front of
                        the coast would justify per se the use of the straight line method. The
                        islands, as the comments indicate, would have to be related to the coast in
                        somewhat the same manner as the <hi rend="italic">skjaergaard</hi> in
                        Norway. In the view of the Government of the United States, the words “or
                        because there are islands in its immediate vicinity” are too general and do
                        not convey as accurately as desirable what the Commission apparently had in
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Article 19, the Government of the United States is satisfied
                        that the text incorporates principles upheld by the International Court of
                        Justice in its judgment of April 19, 1949, in the Corfu Channel case,<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d268fn4">For text of this judgment, see International

                            Company, no date), p. 4.</note> but it believes that the comments on
                        this article should include a short statement of the factual circumstances
                        upon which the court was ruling, since such a statement would point up and
                        illustrate the significance and meaning of the principles embodied in
                        Article 19.</p>
                    <p>So far as concerns the question of the breadth of the territorial sea and the
                        various suggestions set out in paragraph 68 of the <pb n="517"

                            >Reference is to the nine divergent opinions on the question of the
                            breadth of the territorial sea expressed during the Commission’s

                            153.</note> the guiding principle of the Government of the United States
                        is that any proposal must be clearly consistent with the principle of
                        freedom of the seas. Some of the proposals amount to a virtual abandonment
                        or denial of that principle. In this connection it must be pointed out that
                        the high seas are an area under a definite and established legal status
                        which requires freedom of navigation and use for all. They are not an area
                        in which a legal vacuum exists free to be filled by individual states,
                        strong or weak. History attests to the failure of that idea and to the
                        evolution of the doctrine of the freedom of the seas as a principle fair to
                        all. The regime of territorial waters itself is an encroachment on that
                        doctrine and any breadth of territorial waters is in derogation of it; so
                        the derogations must be kept to an absolute minimum, agreed to by all as in
                        the interest of all.</p>
                    <p>That the breadth of the territorial sea should remain fixed at three miles,
                        is without any question the proposal most consistent with the principle of
                        freedom of the seas. The three-mile limit is the greatest breadth of
                        territorial waters on which there has ever been anything like common
                        agreement. Every one is now in agreement that the coastal state is entitled
                        to a territorial sea to that distance from its shores. There is no agreement
                        on anything more. If there is any limit which can safely be laid down as
                        fully conforming to international law, it is the three-mile limit. This
                        point, in the view of the Government of the United States, is often
                        overlooked in discussions of this subject, where the tendency is to debate
                        the respective merits of various limits as though they had the same sanction
                        in history and in practice as the three-mile limit. But neither 6 nor 9 nor
                        12 miles, much less other more extreme claims for territorial seas, has the
                        same historical sanction and a record of acceptance in practice marred by no
                        protest from other states. A codification of the international law
                        applicable to the territorial sea must, in the opinion of the Government of
                        the United States, incorporate this unique status to the three-mile limit
                        and record its unquestioned acceptance as a lawful limit.</p>
                    <p>This being established, there remains the problem of ascertaining the status
                        of claims to sovereignty beyond the three-mile limit. The diversity of the
                        claims involved bear witness, in the opinion of the Government of the United
                        States, to the inability of each to command the degree of acceptance which
                        would qualify it for possible consideration as a principle of international
                        law. Not only does each proposed limit fail to command the positive support
                        of <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0544"/>any great number of nations, but
                        each has been strongly opposed by other nations. This defect is crucial and,
                        in view of the positive rule of freedom of the sea now in effect in the
                        waters where the claims are made, no such claim can be recognized in the
                        absence of common agreement. A codification of the international law
                        applicable to the territorial sea should, in the view of the Government of
                        the United States, record the lack of legal status of these claims.</p>
                    <p>While unilateral claims to sovereignty or other forms of exclusive control
                        over waters heretofore recognized as high seas cannot be regarded as valid,
                        this is not to say that the reasons, legitimate or otherwise, which motivate
                        such claims should be ignored. In some cases, at least, these attempts of
                        the coastal state to appropriate to its exclusive use large areas of the
                        high seas seem to be based on a real concern for the conservation of the
                        resources of the sea found in such waters. Efforts of the Commission and of
                        the nations to settle such problems should be unceasing. But the remedy is
                        not unilateral action in defiance of long established and sound principles
                        of law applicable to other matters. In many cases the nations taking such
                        action would seem to have little to gain from abandonment of such principles
                        and reversion to a condition of anarchy on the high seas. The sounder
                        approach would appear to be an effort to reach agreement on the principles
                        applicable to the real matters at issue, such as conservation of natural
                        resources and rights to fish.</p>

                    <p>The suggestion that the use of discreet firm pressure on Latin American
                        Governments should be carefully considered is strongly seconded. Recently
                        the Mexican authorities have apparently stopped seizing American shrimp
                        fishing boats. It has been publicly reported that this change of attitude
                        has been brought about by threats of American shrimp fishing interests to
                        support legislation barring the sale of shrimp in the United States markets
                        by Mexican fishing interests. If there are any official reports in the
                        Department on this I have not seen them. However, the story seems to make
                        sense. Also pertinent in this connection is a recent report from our Embassy
                        in Lima in connection with the imposition of fines on two American fishing
                        boats which put into Callao. The Embassy reported that Peru had expressed
                        regret at the incident due especially to its possible unfavorable effect on
                        the tuna tariff question in Washington. It is suggested that when the Latin
                        Americans are given to understand that seizures of our boats outside the
                        three-mile limit no longer are going to result in easy money, but are going
                        to be met with economic retaliation or such other measures as will make such
                        action unprofitable, seizures will stop. Where the South American countries
                        are actually concerned with conservation, we can meet them at least half
                        way, but where their objective is the exaction of tribute, we might well
                        revert to a famous historic position on that subject.</p>

                            respect to customs, fiscal and, perhaps public health matters. However,

                            be developed on a worldwide basis, and that while its discussion with
                            the Latin Americans is not precluded, agreement should be reached only

                                to territorial waters more than three miles in breadth. This policy
                                was confirmed by the President in a letter to Senator Daniel and
                                others in which he stated that there had been no change in the
                                traditional position of the United States, and that it would
                                continue to be the policy of the United States to assert the right

                                of territorial waters was written into law in the Submerged Lands
                                Act subject to the right of the Gulf coast states to establish an
                                historic claim limited to nine miles. It is understood that the
                                Department of Justice will take the position in a suit soon to be
                                filed in the Supreme Court with respect to the Tidelands Oil
                                legislation that the Gulf coast states’ claim to more than three
                                miles is without legal basis. Until there is a change in the law and
                                policy our position vis-à-vis other countries is clear and even a
                                suggestion that we might be willing to abandon the three-mile
                                position could be disastrous. Not only is that the only breadth of
                                territorial waters which has ever had any sanction as a general rule
                                of international law, but it is the one most consistent with the
                                freedom of the seas which is a cardinal position of United States
                                policy. These views have just been affirmed <pb n="521"

                                we indicate any willingness to abandon the three-mile limit with its
                                strong legal, traditional and logical basis, we will have had it as
                                far as any bargaining position with other nations on such matters as
                                fisheries, conservation of natural resources, etc. is concerned.</p>
                            <p>While it may be true that “only a minority of nations would support
                                us” on the three-mile position, if “minority” is based on a head
                                count, the implication that this position cannot therefore be
                                maintained does not necessarily follow. As pointed out in the
                                statement of policy recently sent to the Secretary, the states still
                                adhering to the three-mile rule represent not only most of the
                                powerful states of the world, but they represent a great
                                preponderance of its merchant shipping and naval power. It is not
                                likely that any matter of such serious concern to these nations as
                                freedom of the seas is going to be determined ultimately on a head
                                count, except in a superficial sense. This is not to say that the
                                views of the less powerful countries can or should be ignored, or
                                that our efforts to change their position by one legitimate means or
                                another can be relaxed. It is to say that our position cannot be
                                abandoned simply because it is faced by a numerical majority.</p>

                        <item>Perhaps the most adamant adherent of the three-mile position, and the
                            policy to support that position, is the Department of Defense. It is
                            because of the effect which a change in that policy would have in
                            wartime, perhaps more than any other single reason, that the United
                            States must maintain its traditional position on the three-mile limit.
                            It is doubted, however, that there will be any serious conflict on this

                        the necessary preliminary preparation is made. Such preparation would
                        necessitate close collaboration between L and <gloss target="#t_ARA1"
                            >ARA</gloss>. It is suggested that such conversations should have two
                        general objectives: (a) to assure the Latin American countries that the
                        United States is sympathetic to their desires for fisheries conservation in
                        the waters off their coasts and is prepared to work out with them agreements
                        concerning conservation and fishing rights; and (b) to persuade the Latin
                        American countries to change their views concerning the breadth of
                        territorial waters.</p>
                    <p>With respect to (a), it should be made clear in whatever way is most feasible
                        that, while the United States recognizes their interest in the resources of
                        the sea off their coasts and is willing to negotiate agreements which will
                        protect the interests of all parties concerned, <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522"

                        Conference has yet been fully developed. The major responsibility for this
                        is <gloss target="#t_UFW1">U/FW</gloss>s, but it is hoped that the position

                    <p>The United States initiated this resolution after consulting with a number of
                        other governments and winning their support as co-sponsors. Its ultimate aim
                        in so doing is not fully apparent on the face of the resolution and the
                        nature, extent, and importance of the U.S. interests involved must,
                        therefore, be viewed in the light of other current developments. These are: <list>

                    <p>These are the events and they are tied together by a common denominator: The
                        future course of generally accepted state practice in regard to the breadth
                        of territorial waters and extraterritorial controls of one kind or another
                        over natural resources. The underlying problem involved in the various
                        meetings is the desire of a large number of countries to retain for their
                        own future exploitation the resources of the continental shelf, and
                        superjacent waters, and the efforts of some countries for that purpose to
                        extend their sovereignty not only over the continental shelf but also over
                        areas of the high seas extending as far as 200 miles from their coasts. The
                        U.S. has no argument with claims to the continental shelf. But claims to
                        territorial waters in excess of the three-mile limit conflict with the U.S.
                        position and damage our traditional policy of maintaining the freedom of the
                        seas.</p>

                    <p>The work of the Rome Conference, therefore, can have wide implications
                        favorable to the U.S., depending upon the extent to which perhaps the
                        heaviest contributor to high seas claims—fishery conservation, can
                        successfully be extricated from the overall problem and dealt with on its
                        own merits. The fundamental position of the United States with reference to
                        the fisheries problem is that conservation can best be achieved by
                        application of soundly executed scientific programs involving international
                        agreement among states concerned, and does not in any sense require the
                        extension of sovereignty over coastal waters beyond the three-mile limit.
                        Establishment of a sound precedent in this respect at Rome would affect the
                        consideration of this matter in other forums throughout the world.</p>

                        the U.S. at the Rome meeting has been given careful thought. Taking into

                        scope; that (4) it brings into issue questions affecting U.S. high seas
                        fishing operations east, west, and south; and that (5) treatment of its
                        subject will have a heavy impact upon the related subjects of territorial
                        waters and continental shelf; it is recommended that the delegation should
                        be comprised of a minimum of nine persons (six delegates, three advisers),
                        as follows:</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">1. Our Past Position.</hi></p>
                    <p>In the past the U.S. has not favored or encouraged the development of
                        world-wide conservation principles or regulations and has not participated
                        in discussions and suggestions in response to inquiries circulated by the
                        International Law Commission. It was our position that no action at the
                        world level was needed since we had been successful in negotiating and
                        implementing satisfactory conservation agreements covering our international
                        fishery problems and we have felt that as new problems developed it would be
                        possible to negotiate agreements suitable for their handling. It was thought
                        that this was the most practical procedure and could be used elsewhere if
                        true conservation problems existed. We have played an important role in
                        negotiating and operating seven international conventions for the
                        conservation of living resources of the sea. These range from the Fur Seal
                        Convention which became effective in 1911 to the North Pacific Fisheries
                        Convention which became effective in 1954. The older Conventions, Fur Seal,
                        Halibut, and Fraser River Sockeye Salmon, have been brilliantly successful
                        in establishing and maintaining the resources. The newer conventions are
                        generally making encouraging progress toward solution of their problems.</p>
                    <p>The interested segments of the U.S. public, particularly the commercial
                        fishing interests of the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf areas, were particularly
                        in strong support of the policy that we avoid commitment to general policies
                        at the world level in favor of ad hoc action with respect to specific
                        problems.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">2. New Developments.</hi></p>
                    <p>Many of the nations of the world have, or believe they have, serious
                        unresolved international conservation problems. In consideration of this,
                        the International Law Commission, on instructions of the General Assembly of
                        the U.N., has proceeded with the exploration and development of proposals
                        for international law respecting high seas fisheries. The U.S. has taken no
                        part in this development <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0552"/>and the
                        results in their present form do not appear either practical or acceptable
                        to the U.S. or, we believe, to a majority of nations.</p>
                    <p>A number of countries have claimed jurisdiction over wide areas of the high
                        seas which they tried to justify as providing the only way in which
                        fisheries conservation could be assured. The differences between these
                        claimants to extreme jurisdiction and the supporters of the traditional
                        concept of the freedom of the seas have become increasingly great and there
                        has been a strong tendency recently for the more extreme groups to solidify
                        their positions by joint action. A small group of states of Latin America
                        are striving strenuously to establish a regional position on international
                        fishery principles and to implement these claims. There is increasing
                        probability that such unilateral claims implemented by force will be
                        countered by force unless means are developed for resolving the differences
                        at a world level. The differences cut across the free-world countries; the
                        argument between the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> and Iceland,
                        affecting NATO; the Japan–Korea fishery jurisdiction question, affecting
                        cooperation in the Far East; and growing differences between the U.S. and
                        certain Latin American countries, disturbing relations in the Western
                        Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">3. Current U.S. Position.</hi></p>
                    <p>Because of these developments the U.S. has shifted from a passive to an
                        active position with respect to developing agreement on a satisfactory set
                        of world-wide conservation principles. This new position has been taken
                        because it now appears to offer the most promising approach to resolving or
                        reducing jurisdictional disputes. If agreement is reached on a satisfactory
                        set of conservation principles, then the question of jurisdiction over
                        oceanic areas can be resolved on its merits without becoming entangled in
                        the conservation problem.</p>
                    <p>Through an extensive series of meetings and discussions with representatives
                        of the U.S. fishing industry, these groups have come to appreciate the
                        over-all problem involved and have been brought into sufficient agreement
                        with respect to international conservation principles as to permit the U.S.
                        to take the initiative in promoting world agreement in this field. This
                        enlightened position of the U.S. industry has been greatly facilitated by
                        the fact that in our various international fishery conventions we have
                        worked out practical solutions for most of the international problems which
                        the International Law Commission has been studying. It is believed that by
                        generalizing and expanding some of these proved solutions a basis is
                        provided for the development of international principles which are both
                        sound and practical.</p>

                    <p>In 1953 the International Law Commission recommended to the United Nations
                        General Assembly’s consideration a set of fisheries articles.<note n="2"

                        These were received too late for consideration at the 1953 session of the
                        General Assembly. Since then these fisheries articles have been studied at
                        length by the United States. It is our opinion that the International Law
                        Commission has in these articles done an excellent job in pointing up basic
                        international fisheries problems for which new principles are needed.
                        However, we have some technical disagreement with respect to the wording and
                        to certain of the procedures recommended. It is our opinion that some of
                        these procedures would be impractical in their application and that there is
                        no possibility of developing support for them from the majority of nations.
                        In view of this, the U.S. took the initiative in sponsoring a General
                        Assembly decision to convoke an international technical fisheries conference
                        to study these problems and types of solutions. This Conference, to be
                        convened at Rome April 18, 1955, has two functions; (1) to acquaint nations
                        with the nature and seriousness of the problems and develop agreement on
                        acceptable solutions, and (2) to bring the conference’s findings and
                        recommendations to the attention of the International Law Commission to
                        assist that body in a reconsideration of its fisheries articles. With this
                        background, the International Law Commission would be enabled to make
                        recommendations to the General Assembly which have a far better chance of
                        general acceptance.</p>

                    <p>At its Ninth Session the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a
                        resolution to convene a world fisheries conference at Rome on April 18,
                        1955, which conference is to report its findings to the International Law
                        Commission. It is expected that the International Law Commission will have
                        for consideration during its Spring 1955 session the report of the fisheries
                        conference. It should have an opportunity to make any changes in its draft
                        fisheries articles as it sees fit and to submit these revised articles to
                        member governments for their study and comment later this year. It is
                        expected that the International Law Commission will in 1956, prepare its
                        final recommendations on fisheries articles and submit these to the Eleventh
                        Session of the General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>At the regional level, the problems concerned with the regime of the high
                        seas will be considered by the Inter-American Juridical Committee during the
                        summer of 1955. The report of this Committee <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528"
                            facs="0554"/>will be considered by the Inter-American Council of Jurists
                        at its meeting early in 1956. The regime of the high seas and the matter of
                        the continental shelf will be considered by a Specialized Technical
                        Conference to be convened by the Organization of American States, probably
                        in the Spring of 1956.</p>
                    <p>It will be noted that the first in this series of meetings will be at the
                        world level. This appears to be highly desirable to minimize the possibility
                        of regional blocs reaching positions which the world bodies will be unable
                        to reconcile.<note n="3" xml:id="d271fn3">For additional information on the

                        state over fisheries, or the legal status of the super-adjacent waters of
                        the continental shelf. The over-all results were considered satisfactory or

                        present.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Conference Conclusions</hi> The final report and
                        conclusions were accepted by all except a few delegations, which filed
                        reservations. Among the latter were Chile, Peru and Ecuador. In the report’s
                        conclusions the conference notes with satisfaction conservation measures
                        already carried out in certain regions and for certain species at the
                        national and international level. International cooperation in research and
                        regulation for the conservation of high seas fisheries is deemed essential,
                        and the conference considers that wherever necessary further conventions for
                        those purposes should be negotiated. The conclusions show agreement on a
                        definition of the objectives of conservation, of which the principal one is
                        to obtain the maximum yield which will be sustainable. The conference agreed
                        that when formulating conservation programs, account should be taken of the
                        special interests of the coastal state in maintaining the productivity of
                        the resources of the high seas near to its coast. It endorsed the present
                        system of international fisheries regulation, which is based on the
                        geographical and biological distribution of the marine populations covered
                        by individual conventions signed by the nations concerned.</p>
                    <p>Seven guiding principles are set forth for formulating fisheries conventions:
                        1) A convention should cover one or more stocks of marine animals capable of
                        separate identification and regulation, or else a defined area, taking into
                        account scientific and technical factors. 2) All states fishing the resource
                        and the adjacent coastal states should have the opportunity of joining the
                        convention and of participating in the consideration and discussion of
                        regulatory measures. 3) Conservation regulations introduced under a
                        convention should be based on scientific research and investigation. 4) All
                        signatory states should as far as practicable participate directly, or
                        through the support of a joint research staff, in the scientific research
                        and investigation carried out for the purposes of the convention. 5) All
                        conventions should have clear rules regarding the rights and duties of
                        member nations and clear operating procedures. 6) Conventions should clearly
                        specify the kind or types of measures which may be used in order to achieve
                        their objectives. 7) Conventions should provide for effective enforcement.
                        Nothing in these guiding principles is intended to prevent states from
                        making agreements on such other fishery matters as they may wish or to limit
                        the authority or responsibilities of a state to regulate its fisheries on
                        the high seas when its nationals alone are involved.</p>
                    <p>The conference concludes that conventions and the regulatory measures taken
                        thereunder should be adopted by agreement among <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530"
                            facs="0556"/>all interested countries. It recognizes, however, that
                        disagreements may arise over scientific and technical matters relating to
                        fishery conservation and recommends that nations agree to refer such
                        differences to the findings of suitably qualified and impartial experts
                        chosen by the parties concerned on an ad hoc basis.</p>
                    <p>The conference considered the problem created when the intensive exploitation
                        of offshore waters adjoining heavily fished inshore waters affects the
                        abundance of fish in the inshore waters pending the establishment of an
                        adequate conservation regime for the area. It was agreed that this problem
                        required further study.</p>
                    <p>During the discussions the Latin American bloc made a strong attempt to
                        obtain a conference decision that the coastal state should regulate
                        fisheries off its coast when the states concerned are unable to reach
                        agreement on a conservation program. The conference was more or less evenly
                        divided on the question of whether consideration of the rights of coastal
                        states was outside its competence. By a vote of 21 to 20 the conference
                        decided it did not have the necessary authority.</p>
                    <p>The results of the conference substantially reinforce the US position on
                        fisheries conservation and, it is hoped, will enable the International Law
                        Commission to make recommendations to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        General Assembly which will be satisfactory to the US. The conference
                        conclusions are indirectly favorable to the US position on the juridical
                        question of territorial waters, since they disclose that proprietary claims
                        over the high seas are not necessary to ensure the conservation of
                        resources. Conservation objectives are usually cited as the basis for claims
                        to sovereignty over the high seas.</p>

                            <p>It is thus clear that in proclaiming the jurisdiction and control of

                                this Government meant, both in 1945 and in 1953, to claim
                                jurisdiction and control of submerged lands up to the 100 fathom
                                line.</p>
                            <p>A large number of the areas which the Secretary of Defense proposes
                                to restrict from exploration and exploitation extend beyond the 100
                                fathom line. To the extent that they do they appear not to be within
                                the purview of Section 12(d) of the Act and consequently not
                                appropriate for designation by the Secretary of Defense

                                principle as it is now understood in international law. It has <pb

                            <p>One of the most serious difficulties with which the United States has
                                to cope in this field is the attempt by a number of states to claim,
                                by invoking the continental shelf principle, rights which have no
                                direct genuine relationship to it. An order purporting to extend the
                                control and jurisdiction of the United States beyond the edge of the
                                continental shelf could only serve to reinforce the contention of
                                these states that they do not have to limit their claims to the
                                continental shelf. It would clearly weaken our own position, as well
                                as the strength of the international support which our position
                                presently receives.</p>
                            <p>Yet, these adverse consequences would be incurred without any
                                prospect of securing a worthwhile advantage in return; for the
                                exploitation of resources beyond the edge of the continental shelf
                                is generally not considered, so far as can be foreseen at present,
                                to be a practical possibility, and hence there is no need to
                                prohibit such exploitation.</p>

                                Florida Keys in the North and from Cuba in the South by channels
                                deeper than 100 fathoms. The status of this area is by no means
                                clear, but Cuba might conceivably also claim some jurisdiction and
                                control over it.</p>

                        <item>What has been said above relates solely to the proposed restrictions
                            on the exploration and exploitation of the outer continental shelf as
                            shelf and is not to be taken as the expression of any views as to the
                            use of the superjacent seas and air space for the defense purposes
                            indicated. It has been the position of this Government since the
                            Presidential Proclamation of 1945 that the rights of a state in the
                            continental shelf cannot affect the legal status of the superjacent
                            waters as high seas or the legal status of the air space above them, a
                            position which has been endorsed by a large number of nations and by the
                            International Law Commission of the United Nations as representing a
                            correct statement of applicable international law. In order to avoid any
                            implication that the defense activities planned in the superjacent
                            waters or air space necessarily rest on claims to the continental shelf
                            it would seem preferable to designate the restricted areas simply by
                            their geographical limits and without reference to specific military
                            purposes.</item>

                    <p>The Tenth Inter-American Conference, which met in Caracas in March 1954,
                        passed a resolution calling on the Council of the Organization of American
                        States to convene a Specialized Conference <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536"
                            facs="0562"/>to study the juridical and economic aspects of the
                        continental shelf and oceanic waters, and their natural resources. To
                        prepare for the Conference, the Council requested the Inter-American Council
                        of Jurists, its technical advisory organ on legal matters, to make a
                        preparatory study on the legal aspects of the subjects to be treated at the
                        Specialized Conference. The Council of Jurists met at Mexico City from
                        January 17 to February 4, 1956, and passed a resolution by a vote of 15-1,
                        with 5 abstentions. The resolution stated that the 3-mile limit for
                        territorial waters was insufficient and did not constitute a rule of
                        international law and that each state was competent to establish the extent
                        of its territorial waters within reasonable limits, taking into account
                        geographical, geological and biological factors, and its economic and
                        security needs. The resolution also dealt with the continental shelf,
                        conservation of the living resources of the high seas, base lines, and bays.
                        The measure was vigorously opposed by the United States Representative. For
                        an account of the meeting, as well as the texts of the resolution and of the
                        formal declaration and reservation by the United States, see Department of
                        State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 20, 1956, pages 296-299.</p>
                    <p>Instruction 6347 to all American diplomatic offices in the other American
                        Republics, February 18, informed them of United States concern over actions
                        taken at the Inter-American Council of Jurists meeting in Mexico City in
                        January. The Department of State concluded that vigorous action should be
                        taken to correct the situation created by the adoption of the Mexico City
                        Resolution, and requested the Chief of each Mission to communicate the
                        United States position to the President or Foreign Minister of the country
                        to which he was accredited. He was to emphasize the fact that the extension
                        of territorial waters was of particular concern from the standpoint of
                        security. That extension over wide areas of the sea, and airspace above,
                        would create large and complicated problems in connection with necessary
                        naval and air activities, not only in the Western Hemisphere but also in
                        other areas of the world associated with the defense of the Americas. In
                        addition, the Mexico City action had led to a highly unfavorable reaction in
                        the United States, and similar actions at the Ciudad <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName> Conference were likely to reduce
                        seriously Congressional and public support for programs planned to
                        contribute to the progress and development of Latin America.</p>
                    <p>Emphasis was to be put on the fact that the Mexico City resolution was
                        completely unacceptable as a basis for discussion at Ciudad <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName>. If it became the basis of
                        consideration there, the United States saw no way to avoid open controversy,
                        with unfortunate political consequences. The United States believed that a
                        positive solution would be for a mutual understanding in advance of the <pb

                    <p>The Chief of Mission was instructed to deliver an Aide-Mémoire to the
                        President or Foreign Minister, incorporating paragraphs 6 to 8 of the

                            <item>“6. The United States believes it would be extremely helpful for a
                                firm understanding to be reached in advance of the Ciudad <persName

                                principal declaration which would constitute the main resolution to
                                be adopted there. This resolution should be drafted in such a way as
                                to take advantage of agreement wherever agreement exists and to
                                avoid resolutions on aspects which remain the subject of sharp
                                controversy. Specifically, the United States has in mind that the

                                adopt a resolution covering recommendations on the following points: <list>
                                    <item>“a) that all States accept the responsibility to cooperate
                                        in international efforts to assure the conservation of the
                                        resources of the sea.</item>
                                    <item>“b) that States directly concerned with specific fishery
                                        conservation problems enter into agreements for the purpose
                                        of establishing and maintaining adequate conservation
                                        regimes for the fishery resources involved.</item>
                                    <item>“c) that the special interests of the coastal State in the
                                        continued productivity of the fishery resources in the high
                                        seas contiguous to its coast be recognized through granting
                                        it the right (1) to participate in any research and
                                        regulatory program for the conservation of such resources
                                        even though its nationals do not engage in the fishery, and
                                        (2) to impose conservation measures based on scientific
                                        findings which are required to maintain the productivity of
                                        such resources and which will be applicable to the nationals
                                        of other countries, when the need for such action is urgent
                                        and agreement between the States concerned has not been
                                        possible, and subject to adequate provision to protect other
                                        nations against discriminatory or arbitrary measures.</item>
                                    <item>“d) A declaration regarding the rights of the coastal
                                        State over the subsoil and seabed of the continental shelf

                                various technical reports which the Ciudad <persName

                                and would, in the opinion of the United States, constitute a
                                definite and constructive contribution to the inter-American
                                consideration of these important questions. It is recommended that

                                territorial waters, but that if some expression on this subject is
                                felt necessary, a resolution be adopted recognizing that the
                                diversity of views with regard to territorial waters must be
                                resolved on a world-wide basis through appropriate international
                                consultation taking into account the numerous legal, economic,
                                technical and security considerations involved.</item>

                                memorandum stated that irresponsible action disregarding the U.S.
                                position, such as the resolution passed at Mexico City, undermined
                                the usefulness of the OAS. He proposed that the United States make
                                Latin American countries aware “that any repetition of the Mexico

                    </list>
                    <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to outline the basic approach of the United
                        States to the OAS Specialized Conference on <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539"
                            facs="0565"/>the Continental Shelf and Oceanic Waters which is to be
                        held at Ciudad <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName> in March
                        1956.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Situation</hi></p>
                    <p>The Conference is not one which the United States views with pleasure. The
                        resolution calling for it was adopted by the Tenth Inter-American Conference
                        at Caracas as a means of avoiding a thoroughly undesirable resolution
                        supporting the thesis of Chile, Ecuador and Peru that States have a right to
                        claim 200 miles of the ocean off their coasts. The decision of the Caracas
                        Conference has made it inevitable that the Ciudad <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName> Conference be held. It is,
                        therefore, necessary that the United States attend and exercise a
                        restraining influence on the deliberations and conclusions insofar as they
                        tend to oppose U.S. policy.</p>
                    <p>The United States has interests throughout the world in the problem of the
                        regime of the high seas. Our views on this problem are shared by countries
                        with important high seas fishing and maritime interests, most of which are
                        located outside the Western Hemisphere. Opinion of the Latin American States
                        generally favors wider extension of territorial waters than the United
                        States would agree to and would grant other forms of jurisdiction to the
                        coastal States over adjacent oceanic waters. For all these reasons, the
                        United States prefers that any ultimate agreement on principles of
                        international law to be incorporated in a regime of the high seas should be
                        developed in a United Nations meeting rather than in a regional meeting of
                        the OAS. The United States is, therefore, not prepared to make any basic
                        concessions in its position on the regime of the high seas at the Ciudad
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName> Conference.</p>
                    <p>Three factors create special difficulties for the United States at the Ciudad
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName> Conference. The Latin
                        American States generally lack trained scientists in the fields of geology,
                        oceanography and related studies, particularly marine biology. This opens
                        the Conference up to the danger that conclusions in the scientific field
                        will be pressed on the basis of preconceived political opinions rather than
                        scientific knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, there is a strong tendency on the part of the Latin Americans to
                        think in juridical terms and enunciate basic juridical principles as the
                        final product of any conference. This tendency is directly in conflict with
                        the desire of the United States to avoid the adoption of resolutions on the
                        regime of the high seas at a regional meeting.</p>
                    <p>Finally, it is clear that the Ciudad <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1"
                            >Trujillo</persName> Conference will be the scene of a determined effort
                        by Chile, Ecuador and Peru, parties to the Santiago Declaration of 1952, to
                        press for the adoption of <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0566"
                        />resolutions which will support the principles of the Santiago Declaration,
                        including the alleged right of coastal States to claim sovereignty or
                        jurisdiction over wide areas of the high seas to a distance of at least 200
                        miles.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Basic U.S. Position</hi></p>
                    <p>In the face of this situation, the basic position of the United States must
                        be to urge that the Ciudad <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName>
                        Conference be conducted with the view to discussing, exploring and
                        clarifying the nature of the problems which face the American republics in
                        regard to the conservation of the resources of the continental shelf and
                        oceanic waters rather than for the purpose of reaching conclusions on those
                        subjects. As the Ambassador of the Dominican Republic recommended, it should
                        be recognized that the Conference is the first one to be held on this
                        subject by the OAS; that the subject is in all its ramifications one of
                        extreme complexity; and that sustained and detailed study of the various
                        technical, economic and legal phases of the problem is necessary before
                        sound conclusions in any of these fields can be reached. Ill-advised and
                        premature conclusions must be avoided. Methods of pursuing further study of
                        the various problems referred to should be indicated as one of the principal
                        results of the Conference. The various committees at the Conference should
                        therefore be encouraged to submit to the plenary reports summarizing
                        discussions rather than the usual batch of resolutions.</p>
                    <p>In order to reinforce that position, it is necessary for the United States to
                        make clear in advance its firm decision to oppose any efforts to come to
                        conclusions at this Conference on such controversial matters as the extent
                        of territorial waters, the granting of a right to the coastal State to
                        impose its jurisdiction over the high seas, or the creation of a recognized
                        contiguous zone beyond territorial waters wherein fishing will be subject to
                        control by the coastal State. It must be made clear that any attempt to put
                        across decisions on these subjects will promote open controversy with the
                        United States and other interested countries, and that the Conference will
                        under those circumstances run the danger of failure and consequently of
                        bringing discredit upon the OAS.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Specific U.S. Objectives</hi></p>
                    <p>In the scientific field, the United States should emphasize the importance of
                        the scientific approach as the basis for conservation particularly with
                        reference to fisheries. Our Delegation should come prepared with a series of
                        papers to be presented which will outline the present state of knowledge in
                        these fields and the significance thereof; stress the lack of adequate
                        knowledge in all parts of the <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0567"
                        />Hemisphere; and indicate the areas in which additional study and research
                        is most urgently required. The nature of research procedures should be
                        clarified. In this connection, emphasis should be placed upon the need for
                        national studies of domestic fisheries and fishery resources and
                        establishment of adequate records of fishing operations and catches, as the
                        basis for sound development of the fisheries and conservation. The
                        establishment of any centralized OAS institute of oceanography for the
                        Americans should be discouraged as being a less effective procedure for
                        solution of problems concerned with development and conservation of fishery
                        resources than national studies and cooperative undertakings among directly
                        interested countries. The experience of European countries, in fact of all
                        countries with major fisheries, might be cited as examples.</p>
                    <p>In the economic portions of the agenda, the United States should stress the
                        importance of the conclusions of the Rome Conference on the Conservation of
                        the Living Resources of the Sea. A strong demonstration should be given of
                        U.S. achievements in the field of fishery conservation. An opportunity
                        should be given to hear the accomplishments of the Inter-American Tropical
                        Tuna Commission preferably through a statement by its Director. It should be
                        made clear that economic utilization of the resources of the continental
                        shelf are not inconsistent with the maintenance of the superjacent waters as
                        high seas.</p>
                    <p>In the juridical field, the United States must firmly and consistently oppose
                        any thought of drafting conventions or treaties of any kind at this meeting.
                        We should emphasize that as a general rule clarification of scientific and
                        economic aspects should precede the adoption of legal conclusions. Moreover,
                        the United States should take the position that resolutions should not be
                        considered on subjects on which a wide cleavage of positions is evident at
                        this stage. While most of the juridical discussions should be summarized in
                        the form of reports, in general keeping with the general policy mentioned
                        above, the United States can indicate its willingness to go along with
                        resolutions on the following subjects: acceptance by States of a
                        responsibility to promote the conservation of the living resources of the
                        sea; desirability of agreements negotiated directly by all interested
                        parties for the conservation of such resources; and the right of coastal
                        States to participate in any such agreements covering waters adjacent to
                        their coasts.</p>

                    <p>Chapter II of the report contains provisional articles concerning the regime
                        of the high seas, and Chapter III contains draft articles on the regime of

                    <p>Article 1 defines the high seas and Article 2 affirms the principle of
                        freedom of the high seas. There follow thereafter three chapters: Chapter
                        I—Navigation; Chapter II—Fishing; and Chapter III—Submarine Cables and
                        Pipelines.</p>

                    <p>The Government of the United States is in agreement with the definition of
                        high seas in Article 1 and with formulation of the principle of freedom of
                        the seas in Article 2.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Chapter I. Navigation</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States believes that the articles in this
                        chapter constitute as a whole a sound exposition of the principles
                        applicable to problems of navigation.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Chapter II. Fishing</p>
                    <p>So far as concerns the articles in this chapter, the Government of the United
                        States submits the following comments:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Article 26:</hi> The first paragraph of this Article would
                        enable a State operating only occasionally in a fishery to insist that a
                        State with a substantial operation in the same fishery enter into
                        negotiations with it for a conservation program; failing such negotiations
                        an arbitral procedure would be invoked. In order to remove the possibility
                        of abuse, the United States suggests the insertion of the word “substantial”
                        before “fishing” in paragraph 1.</p>
                    <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0569"/>
                    <p>Also under this paragraph, a State could request another State to enter into
                        negotiations even though their nationals were not engaged in fishing the
                        same stock of fish. In the view of the United States, the right of a State
                        to request such negotiations, and consequently to initiate the arbitral
                        procedure contemplated in the next paragraph, should be limited to instances
                        where their nationals are engaged in fishing the same stock of fish. It is
                        suggested, therefore, that the words “fishing in any area of the high seas”
                        be replaced by the words “substantial fishing of the same stock or stocks of
                        fish in any area or areas of the high seas”, and that the words
                        “conservation of the living resources of the high seas” be replaced by the
                        words “conservation of such stock or stocks of fish”.</p>
                    <p>Under paragraph 2 the scope of the authority of the arbitral body in making
                        determinations under Article 26 is not clear. For example, the role of the

                        by one or more of the disagreeing States is not indicated. Nor is it
                        indicated whether the arbitral body would be authorized to originate
                        proposals for conservation measures. The United States is of the opinion
                        that, so far as proposals are concerned, the authority of the arbitral body
                        should be limited to consideration of conservation proposals of the parties
                        to the dispute; and that the arbitral body should not be empowered to
                        initiate conservation proposals or to enlarge upon any that originate with
                        the parties.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, it would seem advisable and appropriate to specify criteria for the

                        interests of the nonfishing, contiguous coastal State to be of two principal
                        types.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, the coastal State is interested in seeing that the living
                            resources in high seas near to its coast are maintained in a productive
                            condition, since its nationals might at some future time desire to
                            participate in these resources. Such an interest would be protected by
                            assurance that an adequate conservation program is being carried
                            forward.</item>
                        <item>Second, the coastal State has an interest in conservation measures
                            applied to high seas contiguous to its territorial waters in so far as
                            these specific measures affect, directly or indirectly, resources lying
                            inside territorial waters. Furthermore, in most instances, a fishery
                            resource occurring in contiguous high seas will extend into the
                            territorial waters. For these reasons the nonparticipating coastal State
                            may have an interest in the specific conservation program referred to
                            above. The interests described in this paragraph can be safeguarded by
                            giving the coastal State, upon satisfactory showing of a special
                            interest, a right to participate fully in the conservation
                            program.</item>

                        day desire to participate in fishing the resource. Specifically, <pb n="545"

                        the adequacy of the over-all conservation program for the resource, as
                        distinguished from a voice in the specific conservation measures. In this
                        connection, specific criteria should be established for the guidance of the

                    <p>The Commission should be composed, in any combination, of seven members well
                        qualified in the legal, administrative or scientific fields of fisheries,

                        might be appointed, at the request of any State party to the dispute, either
                        by the Secretary-General of the United Nations or as follows: one, who shall
                        act as chairman, by the Secretary-General of the United Nations; one by the
                        President of the International Court of Justice; and one by the
                        Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization.</p>
                    <p>If the dispute involves only two States, each should appoint two members of
                        the arbitral commission. If there is more than one State on either side of
                        the dispute, each side, irrespective of the number of <pb n="546"
                            xml:id="pg_546" facs="0572"/>States on that side, should appoint a total
                        of two members of the arbitral commission. If either side fails to appoint
                        its members within three months of the date of the original request for
                        settlement, these appointments should be made by the Secretary-General of
                        the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>Under this proposal, a situation could conceivably arise, for example, under
                        Article 26, where the dispute would involve a divergence of views of three
                        or more States, thereby creating an issue not clearly divisible into two
                        sides. The opportunity to initiate an arbitral procedure should not be
                        defeated by this fact. In the view of the United States, it is essential
                        that any State should be enabled to challenge, bilaterally, in turn if
                        necessary, any of the other States in disagreement.</p>

                        to the attention of the International Law Commission the absence from the
                        draft articles of two propositions which the United States feels are
                        essential to their completeness. The first of these concerns a definition of
                        the term “conservation” as applied to the living resources of the sea. Since
                        the principal purpose of these articles is to codify a set of rules to guide
                        States in their relations with one another in regard to the conservation of
                        such resources and it is proposed that States accept certain
                        responsibilities and commitments in order to assure adequate conservation
                        regimes, it would be essential to define specifically the key term
                        “conservation” in the context of the articles. The Rome Fisheries Conference
                        considered this matter and concluded that the “principal objective of
                        conservation of the living resources of the seas is to obtain the optimum
                        sustainable yield so as to secure a maximum supply of food and other marine
                        products” and that “When formulating conservation programmes, account should
                        be taken of the special interests of the coastal State in maintaining the
                        productivity of the resources of the high seas near to its coast.” It will
                        be noted that the “special interest” aspect of this conclusion has been
                        worked into and given expression by the proposed articles themselves, thus
                        obviating any necessity for defining or clarifying that particular term. The
                        following draft article would cover the balance of the definition of
                        conservation for the purpose of the International Law Commission articles on
                        high seas fisheries.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“For the purpose of these articles, conservation of the living resources
                            of the sea is defined as making possible the optimum <pb n="547"
                                xml:id="pg_547" facs="0573"/>sustainable yield from those resources

                    </quote>
                    <p>The second proposition relates to situations where States have, through the
                        expenditure of time, effort and money on research and management, and
                        through restraints on their fishermen, increased and maintained the
                        productivity of stocks of fish, which without such action would not exist or
                        would exist at far below their most productive level. Under such conditions
                        and when the stocks are being fully utilized, that is, under such
                        exploitation that an increase in the amount of fishing would not be expected
                        to result in any substantial increase in the sustainable yield, then States
                        not participating, or which have not in recent years participated in
                        exploitation of such stocks of fish, excepting the coastal State adjacent to
                        the waters in which the stocks occur, should be required to abstain from
                        participation.</p>
                    <p>This proposed rule takes into account the fact that under the stated
                        conditions the continuing and increasing productivity of the stocks of fish
                        is the result of and dependent on past and current action of the
                        participating States and that the participation of additional States would
                        result in no increase in the amount of useful products. Rather than
                        increasing production the advent of additional States is almost sure to
                        stimulate the abandonment of such conservation activities through removing
                        the incentive for maintaining expensive and restrictive conservation
                        programs. In fact, such advent very probably would encourage the idea that
                        if the resource declined to a less productive level, it would offer less
                        inducement to distant States. In recognition of a “special interest” on the
                        part of a coastal State, the adjacent coastal State could be excepted from
                        the operation of the rule. Strict and precise criteria should be laid down
                        in the qualifications of a fishery for the rule, and questions arising as to
                        qualifications made arbitrative. These criteria should include (a) whether

                        the maximum sustainable yield; (b) whether the stock is under reasonable
                        regulation and control for the purpose of making possible the maximum
                        sustainable yield, and whether such yield is dependent upon the program of
                        regulation and control; and (c) whether the stock is under such exploitation
                        that an increase in the amount of fishing will not reasonably be expected to
                        result in any substantial increase in the sustainable yield.</p>

                        question whether it is necessary to include in the draft the specific
                        requirement in Article 37 that every State shall regulate trawling. In the
                        view of the United States, it would be preferable that this Article, instead
                        of being a mandate, be a recommendation, and that the recommendation be
                        couched in general terms and not single out trawling gear.</p>

                        of the Territorial Sea; and Chapter III—Right of Innocent Passage.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Chapter I. General</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States has no particular comments to make with

                    <p rend="center">Chapter II. Limits of the Territorial Sea</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States has the following comments to make with
                        respect to Articles 3, 5 and 7:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Article 3</hi>. This Article concerns the breadth of the
                        territorial sea. The Government of the United States agrees with paragraph 1
                        of this Article as a statement of fact. However, the Government of the
                        United States does not agree with it as a proposition of law, except in so
                        far as it recognizes that the traditional limitation of territorial waters
                        is three miles. For the reasons indicated in its previous comments, the
                        Government of the United States considers that there is no valid legal basis
                        for claims to territorial waters in excess of three miles. Since it
                        considers that claims in excess of three miles are not justified under
                        international law a fortiori it agrees with the statement of law in the
                        second paragraph that international law does not justify an extension of the
                        territorial sea beyond 12 miles. Consistently with these views the United
                        States is also in agreement with the statement of law in the third paragraph
                        that international law does not require States to recognize a breadth of
                        territorial waters beyond three miles, i.e., that it does not require
                        recognition of claims based on unilateral determination and lacking common
                        acceptance. The United States practice has been uniformly consistent with
                        this position as witness its formal protests against claims of foreign
                        governments to territorial waters in excess of three miles, except where
                        such claims could be justified on an historical basis.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Article 5</hi>. This Article deals with straight base
                        lines. The Government of the United States was in agreement with the draft
                        of this Article previously adopted by the Commission. In the view of the
                        Government of the United States the Article as now drafted is too <pb
                            n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0575"/>broad and lacks the safeguards
                        which were present in the former draft. The removal of the 10-mile limit on
                        the length of the base lines which may be used, and the removal of the
                        requirement that the base lines should not be further away from the coast
                        than 5 miles, open the way for abuses of a principle which should be
                        restricted to extraordinary cases as was made clear by the International
                        Court of Justice in the Fisheries Case between the United Kingdom and
                        Norway.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, it seemed to be implicit in the previous draft that, aside from
                        historical reasons, the only circumstances which would justify use of
                        straight-base lines were a deeply indented coast or islands in its immediate
                        vicinity. With reference to the latter the previous comments of the United
                        States are apposite.</p>
                    <p>Although it appears to have been the intention of the Commission to predicate
                        this article on the decision of the International Court of Justice in the
                        Fisheries Case, the Article now drafted appears to go beyond that decision
                        in that it recognizes as grounds for using straight base lines <hi
                            rend="italic">either</hi> a deeply indented coast <hi rend="italic"
                            >or</hi> the presence of islands in its immediate vicinity <hi
                            rend="italic">or</hi> the existence of peculiar economic interests,
                        whereas the Fisheries Case was not based on any one of these factors but on
                        a combination of factors.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the sea areas lying within straight-base lines, Article 5
                        proposes that they must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to
                        be subject to the regime of internal waters. This amounts to no more than
                        saying that water cannot be treated as inland unless such treatment is
                        justified, an impractical and completely circular standard.</p>
                    <p>With the provision that base lines shall not be drawn to and from drying
                        rocks and drying shoals the United States is in agreement.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Article 7</hi>. This Article is concerned with bays. The
                        Government of the United States cannot agree to the proposal in paragraph 3
                        that the entrance to bays not exceeding 25 miles could be closed by a
                        straight line drawn across their mouth. The Commission indicated in its
                        comments on this paragraph that the 25 miles length was chosen because it
                        was slightly more than twice “the permissible maximum width of the
                        territorial sea as laid down in paragraph 2 of Article 3.” Even if it agreed
                        that the permissible width of the territorial sea could be 12 miles, which
                        it does not, this Government does not see why it necessarily follows that
                        the opening of a bay susceptible of closing by a straight line should be 25
                        miles.</p>
                    <p>It would seem to this Government that since there has been no serious
                        objection in the past to the 10-mile principle that this limit should be
                        maintained.</p>

                        taking this opportunity to attempt to rectify this lack.</p>
                    <p>For several years prior to 1953 <gloss target="#t_UFW1">U/FW</gloss> strongly
                        advocated effective counter measures to the increasing incidents developing
                        from interference by several Latin American Governments with the operation
                        of U.S. fishing boats on the high seas. Our concern with this accelerating
                        trend toward the expropriation of areas of the high seas found little
                        reflection in the Department. To highlight this “galloping trend” <gloss

                    <p>“At the present stage of events, what alternatives does the United States
                        have to its present semi-spectator’s role? It appears that it has three, not
                        necessarily mutually exclusive, courses of action: <list>
                            <item>“(1) Persuade as many of the claiming states as possible that
                                extension of the breadth of territorial waters is against their
                                national interests;</item>
                            <item>“(2) Apply economic and/or political pressures to induce
                                individual states to agree on limits which the United States can
                                accept;</item>
                            <item>“(3) Take the issues to the International Court of Justice, before
                                the positions of the extreme claimants are further consolidated by
                                additional claims and by joint action.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>“It is obvious that no philosophy of the high seas is now extant which, of
                        itself, convinces the non-seafaring nations that a narrow band of
                        territorial waters is in their interest. However, some arguments to this
                        effect do exist but require to be further developed and discreetly brought
                        to the attention of the states concerned. This is, essentially, a long-range
                        program which cannot be realized soon or expected, by itself, to have great
                        influence on the trend of events. Nevertheless, it should certainly be
                        undertaken, but in connection with alternatives (2) and (3) above.</p>
                    <p>“Alternative (2) is the most practical and the only one likely to yield a
                        band of territorial waters anywhere near three miles in breadth and
                        base-lines applied within narrow limits. Success of this approach depends
                        primarily upon how far the United States is willing to go with counter
                        pressures in order to minimize territorial and inland waters. The objective
                        would be to obtain agreement on three miles or a little more for territorial
                        waters, and on the use of straight base-lines only in special situations
                        clearly justifying them, such as a highly irregular coast line, as in the
                        case of northern Norway, and then to be drawn between relatively close
                        points of land. It is important to achieve conservative use of straight
                        baselines, by some concessions on breadth of territorial waters if
                        necessary, in order to minimize inland waters through which there is no
                        right of innocent passage.”</p>

                    <list>
                        <item>“(1) That special attention be given to developing arguments and
                            projects for convincing the claiming states of the advantages of
                            restricting territorial waters to a narrow coastal belt;</item>
                        <item>“(2) That the United States determine as expeditiously as possible the
                            desirability and practicability of applying effective counterpressures,
                                <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0578"/>particularly against those
                            states whose high seas claims have been implemented to the detriment of
                            United States interests;</item>
                        <item>“(3) If pressures are found undesirable or impracticable, that the
                            United States consider adjudication of the issues before the
                            International Court of Justice. In this connection, it should be noted
                            that any action looking to such adjudication of Ecuador’s baseline
                            system and a ruling on the scope of innocent passage would necessitate
                            proposing to Ecuador the negotiation of a special agreement for that
                            purpose.”</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>It will be noted that we suggested, as the first and key counter-move by the
                        United States, the use of economic and/or political pressures, measures
                        which comprise the real substance of present Department plans for overcoming
                        the tidal wave confronting it. Had these recommendations been taken more
                        seriously at that time, the situation today in the matter would, to say the
                        least, not be so crucial.</p>
                    <p>I think the record indicates that <gloss target="#t_UFW1">U/FW</gloss> has
                        not been asleep or lacked initiative in proposing counter measures. Our

                        the Department that the trend was as rapid and contrary to U.S. interests as
                        it appeared to us. However, in extenuation, I must point out that we haven’t
                        enjoyed a particularly responsive audience until recently.</p>

                        the results achieved.</p>
                    <p>From the outset of the Conference it was evident that an entirely different
                        atmosphere prevailed from that which had existed at the Mexico City Meeting
                        of the Inter-American Council of Jurists. The change was manifest in the
                        composition of some of the key delegations, particularly those of Mexico,
                        Peru, Brazil, Uruguay and Guatemala which were headed by experienced
                        diplomatic officers not personally committed to extremist doctrines on the
                        subject matter of the Conference. Informal conversations also soon revealed
                        that most of the Latin American delegations, especially those which had
                        taken a lead in adoption of the “Principles of Mexico” Resolution, had come
                        to Ciudad <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName> with instructions
                        to follow a cooperative course of action and make every effort, within the
                        limits of their respective national policies, to reach an accommodation of
                        differences. The efforts made by the Embassies prior to the Conference may
                        therefore be considered as having produced the atmosphere desired.</p>
                    <p>The principal effort of the U.S. Delegation during the opening days of the
                        Conference was to speak to other leading delegations for the purpose of
                        gaining general acceptance at the Conference of a policy such as that
                        outlined in the aide-mémoire presented by the Embassies to the Foreign
                        Offices pursuant to circular instruction 6347,<note n="3" xml:id="d280fn3"
                            >See <ref target="#d276">Document 276</ref>.</note> namely that
                        agreement should be stated in regard to subjects on which agreement was
                        found to be possible, and that issues on which agreement could not be
                        reached should be defined with a view to further efforts toward their
                        resolution. The U.S. Delegation found a receptive attitude to this approach
                        which within a few days was generally accepted by all delegations.</p>
                    <p>A desire to avoid open clashes and polemics was also reflected in a decision
                        to dispense entirely with general debate. Only two delegations had signified
                        their intention of addressing the Conference as a whole, namely Mexico and
                        the United States. When these two delegations agreed to omit the general
                        debate, several other delegations expressed their pleasure since it relieved
                        them of the necessity of taking fixed public positions on issues on which
                        they would have had to differ with the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Conference was organized into three Committees: I—Continental Shelf,
                        II—Marine Waters, and III—Other Subjects. It was <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554"
                            facs="0580"/>intended that the first two Committees would consider
                        scientific, economic and legal aspects of their respective subjects.
                        However, it also was decided informally to have the heads of delegations
                        meet in closed session in the Dominican Foreign Office in an effort to
                        decide how the basic juridical problems facing the Conference could be
                        worked out. Committees I and II therefore concentrated on scientific and
                        economic aspects of their subjects while the heads of delegations proceeded
                        to tackle the basic political and legal questions. The heads of delegations
                        met daily, sometime two or three times, for about a week. At these meetings,
                        all the main issues facing the Conference, and deriving from the Mexico City
                        Resolution, were debated fully and at times with considerable insistence,
                        but in the last analysis the general policy to which reference was made
                        above prevailed and unanimous decisions were reached in regard to all
                        subjects incorporated in the final resolution.</p>
                    <p>The resolution entitled “Resolution of Ciudad <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1"
                            >Trujillo</persName>” (copy attached<note n="4" xml:id="d280fn4">Not
                            printed as an attachment; for text, see Department of State <hi
                                rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, May 28, 1956, p. 897.</note>)
                        represents the end product of the negotiations which took place among the
                        heads of delegations. At the outset this group had before it separate
                        proposals submitted by the delegations of Cuba, Venezuela and the Dominican
                        Republic, as well as the draft resolution circulated by the United States in
                        advance of the Conference. The United States proposal was accepted as the
                        working document and served as the basis for the discussions. Part I of the
                        “Resolution of Ciudad <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1">Trujillo</persName>”
                        embodies the maximum agreement which could be reached among all the
                        delegations represented at the Conference on the points covered by the
                        United States draft. Four of the seven paragraphs contained in this section
                        represent positive areas of agreement. The other three refer to areas where
                        it was impossible to achieve a conciliation of views and where the most
                        which could be done at this stage was to agree that disagreement exists.
                        Part II of the Resolution was included at the insistence of Mexico.
                        Indicating that his instructions required him to seek a provision which
                        would specify that the statement of points of disagreement did not in any
                        sense imply a judgment by the Conference on the respective positions of the
                        participating governments on these points, the Mexican Representative made
                        very clear that some such provision was a sine qua non to Mexican approval
                        of the Resolution. The language finally approved represents a compromise
                        between those delegations which would have preferred a provision which would
                        have virtually negated the positive value of the Resolution and those,
                        including the United States, which regarded a provision of the type desired
                        by Mexico to be wholly unnecessary considering that Mexico could <pb n="555"
                            xml:id="pg_555" facs="0581"/>achieve its purpose through the usual
                        practice of a unilateral declaration.</p>
                    <p>Agreement on the “Resolution of Ciudad <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1"
                            >Trujillo</persName>” was accompanied by a gentleman’s understanding
                        among the heads of delegations that once the Resolution left the closed
                        sessions and moved through Committee III and Plenary for final approval, no
                        efforts would be made to modify the Resolution in any way, the delegations
                        confining themselves to making explanations of vote if they so desired. This
                        agreement was closely observed. The Resolution received unanimous support.
                        Several delegations took advantage of the opportunity to explain their
                        affirmative vote as well as to include declarations with respect to the
                        Resolution in the Final Act. Copies of these declarations are also
                        attached.</p>
                    <p>The results of the Conference are in general indicative of the efficacy of
                        the strong approach made by the United States to the Latin American
                        governments prior to the meeting. While it would have been preferable from
                        our standpoint to have a resolution which more explicitly set aside the
                        “Principles of Mexico” Resolution, it was evident that any direct attack on
                        the Mexico action would have seriously jeopardized the chances of obtaining
                        the constructive resolution produced at Ciudad <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1"
                            >Trujillo</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The discussions of technical aspects of the continental shelf and marine
                        waters which took place in Committees I and II were, in the opinion of the
                        U.S. Delegation, important and useful. The very fact that scientific and
                        economic aspects of these problems were being discussed by qualified people
                        from several countries had a beneficial effect on the deliberations during
                        the Conference and should have a salutary influence on future consideration
                        of the problems. Moreover, the direct contact among the scientific and
                        technical personnel of the various delegations was useful in laying the
                        groundwork for future contact and continued effort to broaden the scientific
                        understanding of the problems involved. A specific beneficial result was to
                        undermine seriously from the scientific standpoint the “biome” theory which
                        had been developed in Chile, Ecuador and Peru to form a pseudo-scientific
                        basis for extensive claims of the coastal states over adjacent waters of the
                        high seas.</p>
                    <p>The following conclusions can be drawn concerning the Ciudad <persName

                                and frank discussion and accommodation of differing views as is
                                traditional in the inter-American system, thus correcting the
                                serious deviation from this pattern which took place in Mexico
                                City.</item>

                            <item>The Conference served to check further the strong bid of the
                                extremist countries (Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, El Salvador, and
                                Costa Rica) for support among the other countries for their broad
                                claims to territorial waters. It is believed that the movement for
                                the 200-mile thesis of Chile, Ecuador and Peru has lost its
                                momentum.</item>

                                the Conference decided upon an outer limit for controls over the
                                continental shelf so indefinite and subject to future adjustment as
                                to render the shelf less suitable as a basis for claiming that the
                                territorial sea is coextensive with the epicontinental sea, as
                                Mexico, Argentina and others have done.</item>

                                legal factors involved achieved a wider recognition of the fact that
                                the issues concerning the regime of the high seas are extremely
                                complex and not susceptible of facile solutions.</item>

                                reaching any common stand on this question was so clear that little
                                time was devoted even to discussing it.</item>

                    <p>The effect of the “Resolution of Ciudad <persName corresp="#p_TJVV1"
                            >Trujillo</persName>” on the “Principles of Mexico” Resolution is a
                        matter on which each government will have its own interpretation. From the
                        statements made by some delegations, particularly Mexico, El Salvador and
                        the <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> countries, it is evident that they

                        TERRITORIAL SEA</p>
                    <p>An extension of the territorial sea beyond a narrow belt may, on cursory
                        examination, offer an apparent economic advantage to the coastal state in
                        assuring to it the exclusive right to exploitation of the fisheries
                        resources within those areas. Any discussion of the consequences flowing
                        from a universally agreed upon breadth of the territorial sea must, however,
                        take into account not only those immediate consequences to the coastal state
                        but also the more far reaching effects upon maritime trade and commerce and
                        upon international stability and the security of the nations of the free
                        world.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. Effects upon Commerce and Navigation of
                            a Twelve-Mile Rule</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Difficulties of Navigation Beyond Twelve Miles</hi></p>
                    <p>The difficulties and uncertainties of piloting are substantially augmented by
                        navigation beyond twelve miles. The reasons for this are various. Many
                        landmarks employed in visual piloting are not visible at a range of twelve
                        miles. Only 20 per cent of the world’s lighthouses have a range of twelve
                        miles or more. Radar navigation at twelve miles and beyond is of only
                        marginal utility in most instances because many targets normally used for
                        radar navigation are unidentifiable at such distance. Thus, the more closely
                        ships can pass to a coastline, the more accurate and safe their navigation.
                        The seizure of the Swedish ship “Flying Clipper” by the Russians in the
                        Baltic Sea on 29 August is a case in point. That ship had crossed into the
                        Soviet twelve-mile zone because it had drifted off course in a storm during
                        the night and wanted to use the Baltic lighthouses to check its
                        position.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Consequences of Subjecting Shipping to Sovereignty of
                            Coastal State within Twelve Miles</hi></p>
                    <p>For the reasons outlined, ships find it convenient to navigate within twelve
                        miles of a coast but beyond three miles (except when proceeding into port)
                        and are therefore beyond the sovereignty of a coastal State with a
                        three-mile territorial sea for all purposes other than that limited form of
                        jurisdiction exercised in the contiguous <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560"
                            facs="0586"/>zone, i.e., prevention of infringement of customs, fiscal
                        and sanitary regulations. In the event of a collision involving ships
                        navigating in such waters, namely three-twelve miles or in the event of any
                        other incident of navigation in such waters involving the penal or
                        disciplinary responsibility of the master or of any other person in the
                        service of the ship, proceedings may be instituted against such persons only
                        before the authorities of the flag flown by the ship or of the State of
                        which such persons are nationals. While on the high seas no arrest or
                        detention of the vessel may be ordered, even as a measure of investigation,
                        by any authorities other than those whose flag the ship is flying. Any
                        extension of the breadth of the territorial sea will subject ships passing
                        through the extended area, the masters of those ships, and the members of
                        their crews to arrest and detention by the coastal state. The potential
                        interference with normal commerce which would accompany the adoption of a
                        broad territorial sea can thus be readily foreseen. The Suez Canal crisis
                        amply demonstrates the danger to world peace and stability created by
                        unilateral action, albeit legal, taken by a coastal State which affects
                        merchant shipping to the point of exerting the power of life or death over
                        world commerce. The increased risk of interference with the normal passage
                        of ships proceeding through a twelve-mile territorial sea would result in
                        increased insurance rates and, consequently, increased shipping costs.
                        Efforts by merchant ships to avoid such interference by navigating beyond
                        the territorial sea would result in longer, less economical runs and hence
                        in the incurrence of increased shipping rates. The brunt of such increase in
                        rates is borne ultimately, not by the nations engaging in maritime commerce,
                        but by those nations dependent upon that commerce for their economic
                        existence.</p>
                    <p>The very factors which render navigation difficult and uncertain at a
                        distance of twelve miles from shore will themselves give rise to myriad
                        disputes where the issues of jurisdiction will be one involving
                        disproportionate expense and time consumption by virtue of the extreme
                        difficulty of proving a vessel to have been within or beyond a twelve-mile
                        limit. The danger that such disputes may give rise to international
                        incidents with an accompanying increase in international tensions is one
                        which has already materialized. The seizure of the Swedish ship in the
                        Baltic by Russian forces is a case in point, as are the seizures of United
                        States and Cuban shrimp boats off the coast of Mexico, and those of Japanese
                        fishing boats by South Korea. To adopt a twelve-mile rule which for the
                        reasons stated would inevitably lead to an increase in the number of such
                        incidents, would be to knowingly place in jeopardy world peace and
                        stability.</p>

                            Territorial Sea</hi></p>
                    <p>Any extension of the breadth of the territorial sea would impose a burden on
                        the coastal State to patrol effectively the larger area. This burden would
                        entail a concomitant increase in the fiscal expenditures of the coastal
                        State stemming from an increased workload in both merchant marine safety and
                        law enforcement. For example, the United States estimates an approximate
                        initial outlay of $8,000,000 and an increase in annual operating cost of
                        $1,500,000 per hundred miles of coast for an extension of the territorial
                        sea from three to twelve miles. Any failure by a nation to exercise
                        effective control over areas to which it has laid claim would risk the
                        incurrence of international embarrassment to the nation asserting the claim.
                        At least one nation is presently faced with this realization. Sporadic
                        attempts at enforcement would only result in an increase of international
                        disputes and international tensions.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. Preservation of Neutrality</hi></p>
                    <p>The neutralist tendencies and policies of some states are sufficiently clear
                        to suggest that in a future conflict neutrality and the international law
                        pertinent thereto will be matters which may have to be taken into account.
                        It is with this thought in mind that one can approach the question of what
                        effects are likely to be generated should the territorial waters of a
                        neutral be extended from three to twelve miles in breadth. There are certain
                        facile attractions to the twelve-mile limit for a neutral State. If it could
                        safely be assumed that the contending belligerents would respect the
                        territorial sea of a neutral, the possibility of hostile incursions into
                        neutral coastal areas would be materially lessened. Such an assumption would
                        not, unfortunately, be justified. There are many historical illustrations
                        which demonstrate that belligerents have been less than circumspect in their
                        observance of the sanctity of neutral waters. In this regard there is little
                        prospect that the acts of belligerents in a future war will vary in pattern
                        from the past. Moreover, it may be safely assumed that a belligerent in any
                        future war would be even less inclined to accord complete respect to a
                        twelve-mile coastal belt of neutral waters than to a three-mile
                        zone—particularly in view of the probable inability of the neutral to
                        control the broader belt. The problem of the neutral with a twelve-mile
                        territorial sea in defending itself is further demonstrated by the greatly
                        increased ocean areas which would have to be patrolled to insure the
                        inviolability of its sovereignty. As an example of this, the position of
                        traditional neutrals, e.g., the Scandinavian countries, who claim only a
                        three-mile territorial sea for purposes of defense, while claiming a broader
                        belt for other purposes, is significant.</p>
                    <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0588"/>
                    <p>To illustrate the attractiveness of neutral waters to a belligerent, we turn
                        to the submarine. For reasons of its own safety, a submarine will seldom
                        attempt to operate within three miles of shore. The hazards to a submerged
                        submarine are usually lessened materially as the distance from shore
                        increases. Thus, it can be seen that a belligerent submarine might look upon
                        a neutral with a broad territorial sea as offering a particularly attractive
                        haven if she were hard pressed by anti-submarine aircraft or surface vessels
                        of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, other combatant types of belligerent merchantmen may be enticed
                        within the territorial waters of a neutral hoping, however wishfully, to
                        find there a safe refuge from pursuit by enemy forces. There is still
                        another factor which would serve to lure belligerent vessels within twelve
                        miles of a neutral coast. For reasons already discussed, navigation at a
                        distance of twelve miles from shore is, in most cases, inexact and
                        unsatisfactory for purposes of accurately ascertaining a ship’s position.
                        Captains and masters are accordingly strongly disposed to navigate at a
                        distance less than twelve miles from charted navigational objects on shore.
                        In view of all of these considerations, belligerent violation in time of
                        international conflict of the sovereignty of a state with a twelve mile
                        territorial sea, unwittingly or otherwise, is highly probable. It would be
                        unduly optimistic to expect one belligerent to stand idly by while the ship
                        of another belligerent entered the territorial sea of a neutral either by
                        accident or design. In such a case the neutral may not reasonably expect the
                        belligerent to seek his remedies through diplomatic protest. Rather, it is
                        believed that a solution of the problem would more likely be sought through
                        the belligerent’s resort to self-help. Having the war brought to the
                        neutral’s doorstep in this manner would appear altogether likely in the
                        event the neutral were unable to exercise adequate means to preserve its
                        neutrality. Under such circumstances, the ability of a neutral to remain
                        neutral would be highly problematical.</p>
                    <p>It is highly likely that the ships of a neutral would be drawn into
                        hostilities in attempting to repel belligerent incursions into its
                        territorial sea. At the very least, strained diplomatic relations with the
                        belligerent nation which felt itself aggrieved by the neutral nation’s
                        failure to prevent belligerent use of its territory would result. Repeated
                        belligerent use of the territorial sea of a neutral by one belligerent
                        could, not unlikely, lead ultimately to the invasion of the neutral by the
                        opposing belligerent.</p>
                    <p>The possibility of belligerent use of the territorial sea of a neutral as a

                        territorial seas. A three-mile zone would appear to reduce the possibility
                        of belligerent violation, and to that extent would tend to insure a neutral
                        state’s remaining neutral in the event of a future war.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Intelligence Collection</hi></p>
                    <p>The possession of adequate photographic and visual intelligence is vital to
                        many military operations. Amphibious operations, bombing missions,
                        mine-laying and mine-sweeping operations, missile guidance—all are dependent
                        upon information assembled from intelligence. In the collection of such
                        intelligence ships and aircraft fulfill a vital role. The intelligence
                        obtainable from photographs taken at three miles, particularly when taken
                        from a ship, is of considerable value, but that from twelve miles is
                        negligible. If an aircraft engaged in low altitude photo reconnaissance
                        could operate approximately three miles from a coast, the depth of photo
                        penetration would be nine miles further inland than if the aircraft were
                        operating just outside a twelve-mile limit.</p>
                    <p>Photographic reconnaissance is particularly vital to amphibious planning and
                        operations as well as special attack missions. Close-in beach photographs,
                        for example, which have sufficient detail, will provide information on
                        obstructions, gradients, tidal range, consistency and composition of the
                        soil, defenses and defensibility, traffic-ability, accesses, landing points,
                        underwater depths, reef and bar areas. Further, for minimum altitude special
                        weapon attack approaches, the photo aircraft must be able to approach as
                        close as possible to the beach or target area in order that the landfall
                        check points, en route landmarks, initial point, and if possible, the target
                        itself, will all be visible on the photographs. With present equipment,
                        satisfactory low-level attack photography can be obtained at a six-mile
                        range under ideal conditions; however, it is considered most desirable to
                        obtain coverage in to three miles. (Annex I)<note n="3" xml:id="d282fn3"

                    <p>Modern concepts of war consider the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore
                        task groups are dispersed for defense against attack. In order to maintain
                        the highest state of readiness practicable frequent <pb n="564"

                        task groups participate. Defense against nuclear attack and realistic
                        training require freedom to maneuver and the use of as many high seas
                        passages as can be made available. When, in the Mediterranean Sea, for
                        example, high seas passages are reduced in number, thereby curtailing the
                        flexibility and maneuverability of task groups, effective exercises are
                        difficult to conduct.</p>
                    <p>The following criteria have been used to establish the reduction in
                        maneuverability of a task group operating in a sea where the territorial
                        waters of adjacent countries are extended from three to twelve miles.</p>
                    <p>Unlimited maneuverability requires sea room to conduct offensive and
                        defensive aerial and submarine warfare maneuvers.</p>
                    <p>Limited maneuverability requires sea room to zigzag and the ability to avoid
                        interference from other surface traffic.</p>
                    <p>Marginal maneuverability requires sea room to maintain a formation of minimal
                        diameter.</p>
                    <p>Increasing territorial waters from three to twelve miles in the Mediterranean
                        Sea would have a pronounced effect upon high seas maneuverability in those
                        waters. In a passage where adjacent states have a limit of three miles, a
                        single ship or column of ships could effect high seas transit if the passage
                        were more than six miles in breadth. There are 38 such passages in the
                        Mediterranean Sea. The effect of increasing the breadth of the territorial
                        sea to twelve miles in that area would be extensive. For example, of the 38
                        high seas passages now available to single ship movement, only 16 would
                        remain with a twelve-mile territorial sea in force. In like manner, of the
                        twelve high seas passages in the Mediterranean now available for unlimited
                        task force maneuverability, only three would remain.</p>
                    <p>Maneuverability on the high seas would be similarly severely restricted in
                        the Baltic Sea, the South China Sea, the Sea of Japan and the Java Sea—to
                        mention but a few potentially critical areas.</p>
                    <p>For the sake of illustration, we shall examine the effect in distance and
                        time if a task group were ordered to proceed from Guam to Saigon in the
                        event a twelve-mile rule were adopted. At the present time the shortest high
                        seas route is through the Suragao Straits—a route of about 2200 miles. If a
                        twelve-mile limit were in force and the task force were required to take a
                        route to the north of Luzon to remain outside the twelve-mile limit, the
                        route would be increased in length to 2600 miles, or by using a 16 knot
                        speed of advance, the steaming time would be increased by 25 hours. If for
                        strategic or tactical reasons the route north of Luzon proved undesirable,
                        the only alternative would be one via the Makassar Strait, the Java Sea and
                        the South China Sea—a route of about 3500 miles. Here the steaming time at
                        16 knots would be increased by 81 hours. <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565"
                            facs="0591"/>Pursuing this latter route, through rather restricted
                        waters, would permit only marginal opportunities for flight operations,
                        zigzagging or stationing of pickets.</p>
                    <p>Thus, it can be seen that any extension of the territorial sea constitutes an
                        encroachment upon waters which now constitute the high seas and could
                        operate to restrict severely the mobility of the fleet and fleet
                        operations.</p>

                    <p>In order to prevent, in any future war, a repetition of the extensive damage
                        to allied shipping and general disruption of sea lines of communications
                        wrought by the German U-Boat fleet in World War II, sound strategy would
                        call for denying enemy submarines free access to the high seas.</p>
                    <p>The Russian Navy now has a large, modern submarine fleet. There is no reason
                        to deny Soviet capability of building submarines capable of launching guided
                        missiles against coastal cities and industrial complexes.</p>
                    <p>One of the most effective ways to combat this submarine menace would be the
                        employment of various types of blockade in order to prevent as many as
                        possible from reaching the open sea.</p>
                    <p>In the North Atlantic, for example, Russia has only two avenues of access to
                        the open seas; namely, through the Barents Sea and through the Baltic. Sound
                        strategy would, for example, dictate that a barrier patrol be set up between
                        Iceland and Norway to prevent passage of Russian submarines. It is apparent
                        that if … were neutral and had a twelve-mile territorial sea, which allied
                        ships could not penetrate, a possible avenue of escape twelve miles wide
                        would be provided for the Russian submarine. Russian strategy is apparently
                        heavily dependent on a large submarine fleet operating on the high seas.
                        There is no doubt that they would use any means to get their boats to sea,
                        and violation of a neutral’s territorial waters would most likely cause them
                        very little concern.</p>
                    <p>Allied policy in general would most likely be against violation of neutral
                        waters except under circumstances of known violation of those waters by
                        enemy forces. The crucial point is that with a twelve-mile band of
                        territorial sea along the coast of any country, enemy submarines could pass
                        through those waters undetected. With a three-mile limit in effect, this
                        sort of passage would be less likely. This situation would likewise exist in
                        the Mediterranean and in the Far East—Russia’s only other accesses to the
                        high seas.</p>

                    <p>In summation, an extension of the territorial sea to twelve miles would
                        remove an area of more than 3,000,000 square miles from the domain of the
                        high seas. Such an extension although perhaps gaining an apparent economic
                        advantage for the nation claiming it, would work against a nation’s fiscal
                        interests in terms of the increased burden of effectively patrolling the
                        enlarged area. A broad limit would jeopardize the status of a neutral in any
                        future conflict. Universal recognition of a broad territorial sea would
                        encumber maritime commerce and navigation throughout the world and would
                        result in an increase of disputes and international tensions. Most important
                        from a military point of view, such an extension would hamper intelligence
                        collection activities, restrict fleet mobility, and permit greater mobility
                        to Soviet submarines. The cumulative effect of these considerations would be

                            of October 21 to the Secretary of State, Acting Secretary of Defense
                            Reuben B. <persName>Robertson</persName> expressed the grave concern of
                            the Department of Defense over the effects on naval operations of an
                            extension of the territorial sea beyond the traditional 3-mile limit. He
                            strongly recommended that three teams assembled by the Department of the
                            Navy present that Department’s tactical arguments to countries in
                            Europe, the Far East, and Latin America that are militarily allied to
                            the United States and whose claims extended beyond the 3-mile limit.

                        three-mile rule. Navy has assembled two-man teams to assist in presenting

                        These teams will leave Washington probably October 30. Itineraries will
                        follow.</p>

                        act under guidance and control of chief of diplomatic mission in all regards
                        (b) confine their contacts to naval or other military authorities, including
                        heads of defense establishments, except as chief of mission may otherwise
                        recommend. Teams will also indoctrinate local US personnel.</p>
                    <p>Teams would plan spend two days each post first day for briefing with Embassy
                        and second for consultation local officials. Embassy has responsibility
                        review with team its proposed presentation and advise re content and
                        emphasis. Embassy should delete any portions deemed unsuitable for local
                        use.</p>
                    <p>Team discussions will be confined to security arguments and questions naval
                        and navigational operations in territorial waters and will not include other

                    <p>Recommendation requested whether teams should wear military or civilian
                        clothing. If chief of mission has important objections to visit he should

                    <p>The United States attaches great importance to this Conference. It will be
                        concerned with highly difficult and controversial issues in which the United

                    <p>The Department and the various other interested Departments of the Government
                        are engaged in intensive preparations for the Conference. An important
                        aspect of the preparations will involve pre-Conference discussions with
                        other governments. The object of these discussions will be to obtain the
                        views of other governments and, particularly, to promote the widest possible
                        understanding and acceptance of the United States position. The Department
                        expects to request the Missions in the countries invited to the Conference
                        to take appropriate action in this respect as the various aspects of the
                        United States position are developed.</p>
                    <p>During the intervening period, the Department would be interested in
                        receiving from the field, on a continuing basis, any information available
                        to the Missions concerning developments in connection with the Conference.
                        Such reports should be helpful in the present stage of United States
                        preparations and in the formulation in due course of instructions to the

                    <p>The subject Conference was provided for in a United Nations General Assembly
                        Resolution which was sponsored by the United States and 22 other countries
                            (<gloss target="#t_TAB1">Tab</gloss> C). It will be held at Geneva,
                        February 24, 1958.</p>
                    <p>The problems before the Conference are covered by the Eighth Report of the
                        International Law Commission. The report contains 73 articles, which
                        comprehensively cover the law of the sea in time of peace, including such
                        controversial issues as the limits of the territorial sea, freedom of the
                        high seas, international fisheries, and rights over the continental shelf.
                        The Conference is to examine the law of the sea “taking account not only of
                        the legal but also of the technical, biological, economic, and political
                        aspects of the problem …."<note n="4" xml:id="d287fn4">Ellipsis in the
                            source text.</note> The results of the Conference’s deliberations may be
                        embodied in “one or more international conventions” or “other
                        instruments”.</p>
                    <p>Pre-Conference diplomatic discussions are considered essential to achieve the
                        widest possible understanding and acceptance of the US positions on the most
                        important issues to come before the Conference. Among the problems of the
                        greatest concern to the US are those which arise from wide-spread attempts
                        to extend the territorial sea as a means to establish preferential or
                        exclusive rights to fish or to control fisheries for conservation purposes.
                        For this reason the first round of diplomatic discussions would concentrate
                        on these problems. The articles of the Commission’s report on fisheries and
                        conservation appear generally acceptable to the United States and should be
                        helpful in offering alternative solutions to some of the problems. The
                        Commission’s proposals raise, however, the policy questions for the United
                        States described in Tabs A and B.</p>
                    <p>Other issues will be presented for decision as the US preparations progress.
                        One of the most important of these concerns the position of the United
                        States on the related questions of territorial sea limits and contiguous
                        zones for fisheries. For purposes of the first round of the recommended
                        diplomatic discussions, the traditional position of the US on these
                        questions—of three miles for the territorial sea with no contiguous zones
                        for fisheries—will be maintained. <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0600"
                        />However, as a step in reviewing this position, it is proposed that
                        American diplomatic posts in certain key countries be instructed to inquire
                        concerning the attitudes of the Governments toward the recognition of a
                        limited contiguous zone beyond the territorial sea within which the coastal
                        state could exercise exclusive control over fishing. It is hoped that on the
                        basis of information received, the Department will be able to determine the
                        support which such a proposal might receive as a substitute measure for
                        wide-spread claims for a limited (6 to 12 miles) extension of the
                        territorial sea. These claims are generally based on economic considerations
                        and probably represent the greatest threat to the US position on the
                        territorial sea.</p>

                        fisheries, and rights over the continental shelf. The Conference is to

                        <p><gloss target="#t_UFW1">U/FW</gloss> considers that abstention as a
                            general rule of international law is essential to the US position on
                            fisheries and conservation at the Conference. The Legal Adviser
                            disagrees and recommends that the US not propose abstention at the
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi></p>
                        <p>Abstention as previously proposed by the US consists of the concept that
                            where the maximum sustainable yield of any stock of fish is already
                            being obtained and its maintenance and development are dependent on an
                            existing conservation program, states not participating in the program
                            shall abstain from fishing such stock. Any dispute as to whether the
                            required conditions for its application exist is subject to
                            arbitration.</p>
                        <p>The following are the opposing views:</p>

                                <item>is technically and scientifically sound on its merits as a
                                    conservation measure and is the only known procedure which gives
                                    states participating in a conservation effort a strong enough
                                    incentive to develop, restore and maintain the productivity of
                                    new or badly depleted fishery resources.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>is the only procedure capable of protecting US salmon, halibut
                                    and fur seal fisheries against Japanese and other threats
                                    arising from the unrestricted exercise of the freedom to fish
                                    and of meeting certain potential coastal fishery conservation
                                    problems in New England and along the US coast in general.
                                    Abstention is therefore essential if the US is to accept the
                                    principle of freedom to fish. This position does not contradict
                                    our position on freedom of the seas any more than does our
                                    acceptance of other restrictions on that freedom proposed by the
                                    International Law Commission in the interest of

                                    prevent US acceptance of any comprehensive agreement on

                                    Law Commission, and major segments of the industry would
                                    vigorously press for a considerable extension of territorial sea

                                    for fisheries or other purposes. However, this danger already
                                    exists since abstention has been proposed to and discussed by
                                    the <gloss target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> and in any event is no
                                    greater than that posed by other claims to extended jurisdiction
                                    based on economic and other considerations. Safeguards against
                                    abuse can be provided by including criteria specifying
                                    conditions for its application and the obligation to
                                    arbitrate.</item>

                                    conservation issue. This in itself would warrant taking the
                                    potential risk arising from reiteration of US support for

                        <p>Should exploratory pre-Conference discussions be undertaken by the US to
                            determine whether the recognition of limited contiguous zones for
                            fisheries is an acceptable alternative to claims for an extension of the
                            territorial sea? The Legal Adviser and <gloss target="#t_ULS1"
                                >U/LS</gloss> recommend that this be done. <gloss target="#t_UFW1"
                                >U/FW</gloss> disagrees.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi></p>
                        <p>The principal pressures for an extension of the territorial sea arise
                            from claims based on alleged concern for the conservation of marine
                            resources or from alleged or real economic needs, which include
                            employment, food and foreign exchange. The conservation motive has led
                            to the more extreme claims. These are unlikely to rally support at the
                            Conference. Claims based on economic considerations are generally modest
                            and are more likely to win widespread support for departures from the
                            three-mile rule. They constitute the main threat to the established US
                            position and to a conclusion at the Conference acceptable to the US.</p>
                        <p>Available information indicates that the countries that can be counted
                            upon to remain firm in support of the three-mile territorial sea will be
                            in a small minority at the Conference. Canada has recently left this
                            group, proposing a twelve-mile territorial sea, or, alternatively,
                            retention of the three-mile limit but recognition of a nine-mile
                            contiguous zone for fisheries.</p>

                        <p><gloss target="#t_UFW1">U/FW</gloss> opposes the contiguous zone
                            concession on the ground that it would seriously affect some important
                            American fisheries, would not solve the basic problem, and would set a
                            precedent which would encourage further pressures not only for wider
                            contiguous zones for fisheries designed to “fence in” marine resources
                            but for a wider territorial sea.</p>
                        <p>The Legal Adviser and <gloss target="#t_ULS1">U/LS</gloss> consider the
                            proposed inquiries a necessary step in the review of the US position in
                            the matter. A tentative estimate is needed on whether a limited
                            contiguous zone for fisheries, as an alternative to an extension of the
                            territorial sea, would result in a conclusion acceptable to the majority
                            at the Conference. While the retention in the formula of the three-mile
                            limit may create a difficult obstacle, the proposal may be found
                            acceptable as a compromise by countries that for economic reasons are
                            pressing either for a modest extension of the territorial sea or, like
                            Canada, for contiguous zones for fisheries.</p>

                            governments toward the recognition of limited contiguous zones for
                            fisheries as a substitute for widespread claims for a six to nine miles

                        <p>The Under Secretary explained to the representatives of the Departments
                            of Defense and Interior that the meeting had been called to consider two
                            questions of policy concerning the positions to be taken at the
                            Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Law of the Sea. These issues
                            related to the procedure of arbitration [<hi rend="italic"
                                >abstention?</hi>] and the possibility of the acceptance of a
                            limited contiguous zone for <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0608"
                            />fisheries, as an alternative to wide-spread claims to an extension of
                            the territorial sea.</p>
                        <p>Disagreement within the Department of State had been provisionally
                            resolved on these two questions as follows: <list>

                            international law but he saw the advantages of the proposed diplomatic
                            discussions as a practical step in determining the position the US
                            should take on the matter.</p>

                        <p>The Under Secretary summarized the discussions and stated his
                            understanding that there was no disagreement on the recommendations that
                            pre-Conference diplomatic discussions be undertaken on these two
                            questions. He proposed that the group meet again at the end of 1957 to
                            review the results of the diplomatic discussions.</p>

                        <p>At the meeting on the question of abstention which was held in the Office
                            of Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian
                                Herter</persName>, on 28 October 1957, and attended by
                            representatives of State, Interior and Defense, Rear Admiral Chester
                            Ward made the following comments.</p>
                        <p>That abstention was not a recognized principle of international law.
                            Under the circumstances, it would be helpful to contact friendly nations
                            and learn whether they would support such a principle before deciding
                            whether it should be made a part of the U.S. position on the Law of the
                            Sea.</p>
                        <p>He also stated that it was the claim to sovereignty over broad belts of
                            the high seas that constituted a major threat to our national security
                            interests and hence of concern to the Department of Defense. That it
                            would be well, under the circumstances, to consider other means of
                            meeting the demands of coastal states concerning fishing in coastal
                            waters, such as the contiguous zone concept which has been suggested by
                            the Canadians.</p>
                        <p>In connection with Interior’s desire that the security disadvantages of
                            an extension of the territorial sea be weighed against the disadvantages
                            to the fishing industry of the establishment of the 12 mile contiguous
                            zone for fisheries, he was unable to see how such a weighing of
                            disparate matters could be accomplished. The security interests of the
                            US must outweigh all other considerations.</p>

                        <p>With reference to abstention, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWC1"
                                >Herrington</persName> explained that the procedure evolved from the
                            rapid development of long range fishing operations which made high seas
                            fisheries accessible to an increasing number of states. He indicated
                            that the concept is a novel and somewhat complex procedure in the
                            conservation field; that its presentation as a proposed general rule
                            must be accompanied by a good deal of educational work with other
                            countries both prior to and during the 1958 Conference before
                            international support for the concept can be appraised.</p>
                        <p>Defense had expressed concern that “abstention” would impinge upon
                            freedom of fishing, one of the freedoms of the seas, and might therefore
                            open the door to limitations on freedom of navigation with <pb n="584"

                            interests of the United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWC1"
                                >Herrington</persName> pointed out that “abstention” had reference
                            to stocks of fish and not to areas of the seas and said that he found it
                            difficult to see how the concept offered any greater opportunity for the
                            appropriation of high seas than the proposition of a contiguous zone for
                            fisheries which Defense apparently was willing to support as a means of
                            lessening pressures for extended territorial waters.</p>

                        the Secretary General of the United Nations has now informed the Governments
                        invited to the Conference that Geneva has been selected as the site of the

                            August 26, that to avoid overlapping with other U.N. meetings it was
                            necessary to begin the Conference of the Law of the Sea at Geneva on
                            February 24, 1958, a few days earlier than anticipated in the General
                            Assembly resolution. The conference was expected to last for 9 weeks.

                        Report of the United Nations International Law Commission.<note n="3"

                                281</ref>.</note> This report will be the basis of the deliberations
                        of the <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0611"/>Conference. The report
                        contains 73 articles which relate to the law of the sea in time of peace.
                        United States preparations for the Conference are being made in terms of the
                        articles of the report and of the special problems to which they give
                        rise.</p>
                    <p>As an important aspect of these preparations the Embassy is requested to
                        discuss with appropriate high-level officials of the Government the problems
                        referred to in the present instruction.</p>
                    <p>The problems to be discussed relate to the question of the breadth of the
                        territorial sea and the related questions of the conservation of marine
                        resources and international fishing rights. These problems are expected to
                        be the most controversial at the Conference and they pose the most difficult
                        questions of policy for the Government of the United States. The Department
                        has two principal objectives in undertaking the present round of diplomatic
                        discussions. The first is to bring about the widest possible understanding
                        of the United States approach to the conservation and fisheries questions.
                        The problems involved are highly technical and governmental personnel in
                        many countries are not familiar with them. To assist the Embassy in its
                        discussion of some of the more difficult questions, background and
                        explanatory memoranda are enclosed which, as indicated later, may be made
                        available to foreign officials. The second objective of the discussions is
                        to obtain information on governmental attitudes on the procedure of
                        abstention and on contiguous zones for fisheries as a preliminary step in
                        determining the final position of the United States on these questions.</p>
                    <p>It is considered highly desirable that the principal problems covered by the
                        present instruction be discussed in the first instance by the Chief of
                        Mission with the Foreign Minister.</p>
                    <p>At the outset of the discussions with the appropriate officials of the
                        Government, the Embassy may indicate that these conversations are being
                        undertaken pursuant to the recommendation contained in the General Assembly
                        Resolution (see paragraph 11 of Enclosure 1<note n="4" xml:id="d290fn4">See

                        Governments “utilize the time remaining before the opening of the Conference
                        for exchanges of views on the controversial questions relative to the law of

                        adjacent to fishing grounds and non-adjacent <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586"
                            facs="0612"/>fishing states. Two separate sets of problems are apparent:
                        Those that arise from the action of the coastal state for the conservation
                        of marine resources and those that arise from such action on the basis of
                        alleged or real economic dependence on fishing. The requirements of
                        conservation have been advanced as the basis for some of the more extreme
                        claims, such as the 200 mile claims of Chile, Ecuador and Peru. This
                        approach is frequently associated with strong or ultranationalistic reaction
                        to the activities of the highly mechanized industries of the fishing states.
                        The alleged economic dependence has led to more modest demands involving
                        claims of exclusive fishing rights in waters adjacent to the coastal state
                        or to limited extensions of the territorial sea. In both instances, the
                        coastal states have attempted to accomplish their objectives through
                        unilateral action either extending the limits of their territorial sea
                        beyond three miles or claiming exclusive or special purpose jurisdiction to
                        exploit or control fisheries in contiguous areas beyond three miles. It is
                        expected that they will attempt to have their claimed right to do so
                        recognized in the conclusions of the Conference.</p>
                    <p>The extremists will find themselves in a small minority at the Conference.
                        These are the countries that claim a very broad extension of the territorial
                        sea; they generally argue that the three-mile rule is obsolete and the
                        coastal state has the right to determine on its own the breadth of its
                        territorial sea. It may be that these countries will attempt at the
                        Conference to develop support by other means than a broad extension of the
                        territorial sea as such to achieve their objectives. These means would most
                        likely be: (a) recognition of the right of the coastal state to take
                        unrestricted unilateral action for conservation purposes; (b) recognition of
                        broad “contiguous zones” for fisheries or conservation. As a last resort
                        some of them may join the moderates in pressing for a limited extension of
                        the territorial sea, with the economic factor as the main supporting
                        consideration. The principal danger to the United States position will arise
                        at the Conference from the possibility of a majority developing in support
                        of such a position.</p>

                    <p>There are compelling reasons, in the view of the United States, for retaining
                        the three-mile territorial sea limits. The United States considers that an
                        extension of the territorial sovereignty of the individual states would be
                        detrimental to the general interest of the international community and to
                        the security of the free world. It is, moreover, of the view that such an
                        extension is an impractical and unrealistic means by which to attempt to
                        achieve the objective of <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0613"/>the
                        conservation of fisheries resources and is an overly drastic and sweeping
                        approach to the problems raised by the economic factor. The United States is
                        convinced that alternative solutions can be found to the problems that have
                        created pressures for a broader territorial sea belt.</p>
                    <p>The views of the United States in support of the three-mile territorial sea
                        are briefly stated in Enclosures B and C.<note n="5" xml:id="d290fn5"

                        comprise the United States views on the legal issue, on the general interest
                        of maximum freedom for navigation and maritime trade and commerce involved
                        in the maintenance of the three-mile territorial sea belt, and on the
                        factors of the security of the free world that support the same conclusion.
                        The alternative solution, as against an extension of the territorial sea, to
                        the objective of conservation is described below. The special problems
                        created for the United States by the pressures for an extension of the
                        territorial sea arising from the economic factor are discussed at the end of
                        this instruction.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Legal</hi></p>
                    <p>While the United States position on the legal question has been repeatedly
                        stated in recent international discussions, the principal elements of the
                        position have been briefly restated in Enclosure B as background information
                        for the Embassy and for such use as the Embassy may find it necessary and
                        appropriate to make of them. There are many Governments, particularly among
                        the newer ones, that have not fully or actively participated in discussions
                        on the legal merits of the issues involved. The timely exposition of United
                        States views on these issues could be useful in some countries in bringing
                        about a better understanding of the traditional United States position on
                        the question of law.</p>
                    <p>This aspect of the United States position should not, however, receive undue
                        stress during the pre-Conference discussions. With many Governments the
                        legal considerations will carry little or no weight and in any event will
                        not be as persuasive as others advanced by the United States in determining
                        attitudes at the Conference. The general considerations and those which
                        relate to the security of the free world referred to in the following
                        section and in Enclosure C are in the latter category. They state why it is
                        in the national interest of the individual states to support the three-mile
                        belt for the territorial sea.</p>

                        that substantially similar considerations were presented by the teams of
                        naval officers which visited a number of countries in November of last year

                            (Department of State, Central Files, 399.731/11–857)</note>). The
                        Department considers that these visits served a worthwhile purpose and, in
                        many instances, developed an interest in the military and strategic
                        advantages of the three-mile limit which had not been previously considered.
                        The Department desires to keep the United States position and its supporting
                        considerations on this crucial matter fresh in the minds of officials of
                        friendly governments. Obviously, the considerations developed in this paper
                        must be used on a selective basis. Separate instructions will be issued

                    <p>With respect to the conservation issue, the United States will attempt to
                        demonstrate that it has a sympathetic and constructive position in the
                        matter. The United States has been the strongest and most consistent
                        supporter of the conservation of marine resources. It is convinced that the
                        objective in its major aspects cannot be achieved by unilateral action but
                        only by international cooperation based on tested conservation
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>The United States desires to develop an understanding of the technical and
                        scientific aspects of the conservation problem which support the basic
                        approach to the problem in the <gloss target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss>
                        recommendations. This approach is that the objective of conservation can be
                        achieved primarily through international cooperation rather than through
                        unilateral action of the coastal state or through an extension of the
                        territorial sea. A memorandum for the Embassy’s use in discussing this
                        problem and which may be made available to foreign officials is enclosed

                    <p>While the International Law Commission was unable to agree on a definition of
                        the breadth of the territorial sea (see article 3 of its report) its
                        recommendations on conservation were developed in detail. They are contained
                        in articles 49-60 of the report. The <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0615"

                        of the International Technical Conference on the Conservation of the Living
                        Resources of the Sea, held in Rome in 1955. The Commission’s proposed
                        articles are therefore generally acceptable to the United States. However,
                        in their present form they raise two important problems of omission,
                        namely:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Arbitration and Criteria:</hi> The Commission’s proposed
                        articles contemplate agreement on rights over fisheries of the high seas
                        going beyond existing international law. They thus provide for acceptance by
                        states of an obligation to cooperate in the conservation of high seas
                        fisheries, including a commitment to observe, in certain circumstances and
                        under certain conditions, conservation regulations adopted by the coastal
                        state and other states. That is to say, States would accept potential
                        restrictions on their freedom to fish, one of the freedoms of the high seas,
                        in the interest of international cooperation for conservation. It is evident
                        that many states, including the United States, cannot accept such
                        restrictions in the absence of an obligatory procedure for the settlement of
                        disputes as to whether the circumstances and conditions specified exist.
                        Although the Commission’s proposal of a procedure for compulsory arbitration
                        recognizes this fact, the United States contemplates proposing certain
                        modifications to strengthen the procedure and to insure that the criteria
                        for determining the circumstances and conditions mentioned are included in
                        the terms of reference of the arbitral tribunal. There is enclosed

                        incorporated in any conclusions on conservation reached by the Conference.
                        The United States looks upon this procedure as one which provides incentive
                        to develop, restore and maintain the productivity of fisheries resources and
                        therefore as a sound conservation measure worthy of general application. The

                        is our hope that pre-Conference diplomatic discussions will not only promote
                        understanding and acceptance of the proposal but reveal the strength of the

                        <p>Abstention had its origin in our northwest fisheries. In this area, the
                            Government of the United States and Canada working independently in some
                            cases and together in others have, through the expenditure of extensive
                            effort and funds for research and strict regulation of their fishermen
                            preserved the great salmon and halibut resources of the northwest from
                            reduction to the minimum economic level of productivity, as happened in
                            similar situations elsewhere, and are in the process of restoring these
                            resources to their maximum sustainable productivity. The incentive for
                            carrying out these extensive activities has been preservation of an
                            important source of food for our people and increased returns to our
                            fishermen. During the <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0618"/>1930’s
                            Japanese fishermen engaged in exploratory work for salmon in Bering Sea,
                            preliminary to extensive exploitation of these stocks of fish by
                            Japanese fishermen. Following strong representations by the United
                            States, Japan agreed to restrict her fishermen from this area. Had the
                            Japanese embarked upon the exploitation of these resources, the
                            incentive for the United States and Canada to continue the conservation
                            program would, for all practical purpose, have been removed.</p>
                        <p>Following World War II the question of Japanese fishing in the
                            Northeastern Pacific once more became a problem of very considerable
                            importance. Various proposals were considered within the U.S. to keep
                            the Japanese from operating in the Eastern Pacific but none was found to
                            be acceptable to the various segments of the United States fishing
                            industry and the United States Government. Finally a proposal for
                            abstention similar in substance to the above definition but less
                            restrictive in conditions, was proposed as a concept that would cover
                            the stocks of fish restored and maintained by United States and Canadian
                            action, but otherwise not restrict Japanese fishing in the same area.
                            This proposal, after much study within the United States Government, was
                            finally approved as the basis for developing a United States position
                            for negotiation with Japan. In informal discussions with Canada prior to
                            the negotiations, the proposal was accepted by that Government. It was
                            the key element in the United States position at the Tripartite
                            Fisheries Conference in Tokyo (1951). At that Conference abstention was
                            accepted as an essential part of the North Pacific Fisheries Convention
                            and has been in operation since that Convention entered into force.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss>, since its establishment in 1947,
                            has been engaged in the codification and progressive development of law
                            of the sea, including a series of articles on fisheries. Prior to 1955
                            the United States took no position on preliminary drafts of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> fisheries articles. United States
                            fishery interests are so diverse, ranging from one extreme, e.g. tuna,
                            shrimp, desiring complete freedom to fish everywhere, to the other
                            extreme, e.g. salmon, halibut, which would close broad areas to fishing
                            by other countries, that the United States had not been able to develop
                            an over-all position. As the <gloss target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss>
                            progressed with its draft articles on fisheries in directions contrary
                            to United States interests, it became increasingly important that the
                            United States exercise its influence in shaping the <gloss
                                target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> articles to avoid being presently faced
                            with a completed set of articles contrary to its basic interests. During
                            1952-54 <gloss target="#t_UFW1">U/FW</gloss> convened a series of
                            meetings with advisers from all segments of the United States <pb
                                n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0619"/>fishing industry concerned with
                            the problem. Agreement finally was developed on a series of proposals on
                            fisheries. These proposals stemmed in large part from United States
                            experience in successful cooperation with other countries in solving
                            high seas conservation problems through international conventions and
                            commissions.</p>
                        <p>In these proposals abstention occupies a key position. It meets the
                            problems posed by salmon, halibut and fur seal. It meets certain
                            potential coastal problems in New England and along our coast in general
                            and does not damage the U.S. position with regard to tuna, shrimp and
                            New England otter trawling. It is rational and based on sound biological
                            and conservation concepts. It is supported by all major fisheries
                            interests, by the Fish and Wildlife Service, and U/ FW.</p>
                        <p>Abstention is in the best interests of the United States fishing industry
                            whose over-all interests are not served by complete freedom of fishing
                            on the high seas. While such overseas fisheries as the shrimp fishery
                            and the tuna fishery have in recent years been much in the public eye
                            because of the threats to their operations and prosperity, it is coastal
                            fisheries which make up the greater part of the United States industry.
                            Some 75 per cent of United states fishery production comes from waters
                            relatively close to the U.S. coast from stocks of fish most of which are
                            confined to nearby coastal waters. It is unlikely that this percentage
                            will change substantially in the foreseeable future. Freedom of the seas
                            offers little to these coastal fisheries. Indeed, their interests are
                            best protected by extension of jurisdiction. Although a relatively
                            modest extension of the territorial sea or the creation of a narrow
                            contiguous zone would offer protection for some of these coastal
                            fisheries, it would offer no real solution to the conservation problem
                            which faces the halibut and salmon fisheries of the Northwest, the trawl
                            fisheries in New England and other stocks which extend beyond the narrow
                            coastal zone. The abstention principle does offer protection to these,
                            and it does this by dealing with stocks of fish, not areas of the
                            sea.</p>
                        <p>Abstention is not discriminatory. On the contrary, it is proposed for
                            general application in a uniform manner and would apply to large states
                            as well as small states if the circumstances for its application exist.
                            The fact that comparatively few States have as yet advanced their
                            conservation programs to the point where abstention would apply does not
                            detract from the soundness of the concept as a conservation procedure.
                            As additional countries advance in fisheries conservation the situations
                            where abstention will apply will increase. The high seas fisheries of
                            the world are by no means static.</p>

                                States Position on Abstention</hi></p>
                        <p>At the 1955 Rome Conference on Conservation of the Living Resources of
                            the Sea the United States advanced the concept of abstention as a
                            general rule for certain situations concerned with international
                            conservation of fisheries. The United States Delegation to that
                            Conference had instructions to promote abstention “as a principle”.</p>
                        <p>The rationale advanced by the United States at the Rome Conference was
                            persuasive to a considerable number of countries. However, with the
                            pressure of other matters it was not possible to obtain full
                            understanding of this concept by the majority, particularly those with
                            little background in fishery conservation. In the circumstances, rather
                            than put it to a vote with the possibility of having the proposal
                            defeated, the United States Delegation succeeded in having abstention
                            described in the Report of the Conference as a procedure for handling
                            high seas conservation problems such as those of the U.S. salmon and
                            halibut fisheries.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the Report of the Rome Conference the <gloss
                                target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> in 1955 completely redrafted its
                            fishery articles. It included many of the concepts proposed by the Rome
                            Conference but did not include some of the newer ideas proposed by the
                            United States such as abstention. Subsequently, the United States
                            submitted to the <gloss target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> rather extensive
                            comments on its 1955 draft<note n="13" xml:id="d290fn13">See <ref
                                    target="#d278">Document 278</ref>.</note> in which the United
                            States stated, with regard to the fisheries articles, that the principle
                            of abstention is “essential to their completeness”. At the 1956 <gloss
                                target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> meeting these and the comments of other
                            countries were considered at length. The <gloss target="#t_ILC1"
                                >ILC</gloss> members at first were completely unfamiliar with the
                            new concept but it gradually gained support as understanding developed.
                            The Swedish member, supporting it, expressed the favorable view when he
                            said he “regarded the principle more as a product of the conflict
                            between the fundamental principle of the freedom of the sea, on the one
                            hand, and the interest of all States not to discourage the adoption of
                            measures of conservation on the other, the second consideration having
                            precedence over the first”. However, because of the proposal of the
                            member from Mexico to broaden the concept to include economic as well as
                            conservation criteria and the Commission’s lack of competence in
                            scientific and economic matters, it made no proposal but included the

                                    exceptional situations adequately, the Commission, while drawing
                                    attention to the problem, refrained from making any concrete
                                    proposal”.</p>

                        <p>In brief, abstention as formulated in the proposed principle is newly
                            arrived upon the international scene. The problem it was developed to
                            handle arose with the increased efficiency of fishing methods. The
                            abstention procedure is made possible by recent advances in research and
                            management methods for conservation programs and might thus be properly
                            classed as a development in the science and technique of high seas
                            fisheries conservation. Since the United States (and Canada) first
                            proposed abstention to world circles in 1955 (Rome Conference) as a
                            general procedure for meeting certain international fishery conservation
                            problems, it has received increasing support from states and
                            international experts in the field. There is reason to believe that much
                            further progress can be made at the Geneva Conference in 1958 by an
                            intensive preparatory campaign and consultation with other governments
                            directed toward an understanding of the soundness of the concept and its
                            conditional application. Whether two-thirds or majority support for
                            abstention can be developed in the short time remaining will not be
                            fully apparent until the Geneva Conference gets underway.</p>

                                Precedent for Economic Claims</hi></p>
                        <p>Proposals for extending jurisdiction of the adjacent state over high seas
                            areas, based on real or alleged economic need, inevitably will be
                            strongly argued by some states at the World Conference. This will be
                            done regardless of whether or not the U.S. continues to support
                            abstention. The important question is whether the chances of their
                            success would be materially enhanced by the continued advocacy of
                            abstention by the U.S. The answer seems clearly to be in the
                            negative.</p>
                        <p>Abstention was proposed by the U.S. Delegation to the Rome Conference in
                            1955 and strongly advocated in the U.S. comments to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> covering the 1955 draft articles.
                            Abstention has also been proposed by Canada and it can be expected that
                            it will be actively supported by Canada at the World Conference.
                            Moreover, on the recommendation of the Committee of Experts the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretariat has arranged for a background
                            paper for the Conference covering the economic and scientific background
                            of the principle of abstention.</p>
                        <p>From these considerations it follows that any precedent deriving from the
                            proposal of abstention already is set; the remaining question is whether
                            adoption of the concept would materially increase <pb n="596"
                                xml:id="pg_596" facs="0622"/>the support for claims to extended
                            jurisdiction based on economic consideration. In considering this it
                            must be recalled that the U.S. advances abstention as a procedure to
                            assure an adequate conservation program in certain special situations,
                            which does not restrict participating or adjacent coastal states and
                            does not extend jurisdiction over areas of the high seas. Proposals of
                            extended jurisdiction to meet real or alleged economic needs involve
                            displacing participating states and jurisdiction over areas. Thus, two
                            entirely different concepts are involved. It does not follow that a
                            State favoring the abstention concept for conservation purposes would
                            support its enlargement for an entirely alien purpose, namely to advance
                            economic interests. Nor does it follow that a State opposed to
                            abstention as proposed by the United States would necessarily support it
                            if its terms were extended to include economic considerations. In any
                            event, it should be noted that if the States desiring extended fisheries
                            jurisdiction for economic advantage can muster sufficient strength to
                            have abstention accepted on economic grounds, they will be strong enough
                            to have other, broader types of jurisdiction accepted, types which
                            better suit their purposes.</p>

                            abstention being included in the series of articles would be tantamount
                            to inviting all non-participating States to participate in the rich

                    <p>In the reference instruction the Embassy was informed that the traditional
                        position of the United States on the question of the exercise by the coastal
                        state of special jurisdiction for fisheries purposes beyond the three-mile
                        limit of the territorial sea is under review.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the review, it is essential that the Department receive
                        information on an urgent basis concerning the views of certain countries
                        toward a limited application of the principle of contiguous zones in the
                        field of fisheries as a solution to the principal problem creating the
                        pressures for a limited extension of the territorial sea. As indicated in
                        the instruction under reference, this problem arises from the economic
                        factor rather than from concern for conservation. The latter concern or
                        alleged concern has led to the more extreme and less realistic claims. These
                        are less likely to rally support at the Conference not only because of their
                        extreme nature but also because a solution to the conservation problem
                        which, with some modifications, would be satisfactory is contained in the
                        International Law Commission’s proposals. It is evident, therefore, that the
                        economic factor stands as a main threat to the established United States
                        position and to a conclusion at the Conference acceptable to the United
                        States. The economic problem is at the basis of many of the more restrained
                        claims for an extension of the territorial sea and is therefore more likely
                        to win wide support for departures from the established three-mile rule.</p>
                    <p>The Department desires to determine whether this estimate is correct and
                        whether a proposal which would serve to meet reasonable demands based on
                        economic considerations, but which would retain the three-mile limit, would
                        be likely to result in a conclusion acceptable to the majority at the
                        Conference.</p>
                    <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0624"/>
                    <p>The Embassy is requested to advert, at its discretion, to this question with
                        an appropriate official at a suitable early opportunity, preferably during
                        discussion of the matters covered in the reference instruction. The
                        discussion should be in terms of an informal inquiry concerning the attitude
                        of the Government towards proposals such as those made by Canada at the last
                        (Eleventh) Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and concerning
                        its estimate of the support which such proposals might receive at the
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>The Canadian proposal was that as an alternative to a 12 mile limit of the
                        territorial sea, the states agree on a three-mile territorial sea with a
                        contiguous zone of nine miles within which coastal states would have
                        exclusive jurisdiction over fisheries.</p>
                    <p>As understood by the Department, the Canadian proposal would confer a right
                        on the coastal state to exercise the same powers over fisheries out to
                        twelve miles that can presently be exercised only in its territorial sea.
                        This would be accomplished under the guise of a special contiguous zone for
                        exclusive fisheries rights. The contiguous zone conceived for fisheries
                        would bestow even greater powers than are envisaged in the present <gloss
                            target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> fisheries articles (49–60), which sanction
                        regulatory measures but on a non-discriminatory basis.</p>
                    <p>The Canadian-type proposal contemplates, in brief, that the traditional
                        freedom to fish within the additional nine miles, which under the existing
                        three-mile rule is enjoyed by nationals of all states, would be terminated.
                        However, freedom of the high seas would be retained within the nine-mile
                        area for other purposes. This would include such freedoms as freedom of
                        navigation, freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines, and freedom to
                        fly over the nine-mile expanse of waters.</p>
                    <p>Should the Embassy be questioned concerning the position of the United States
                        with respect to the Canadian proposal or other similar proposals, the reply
                        should be made that in recent discussions within the United Nations and the
                        Organization of American States the United States has maintained its
                        traditional position that the existing rule of international law provides a
                        three-mile limit for the territorial sea, and does not recognize that the
                        coastal state has the right to establish contiguous zones where fishing is
                        reserved exclusively to the nationals of that state. For the Embassy’s
                        information the Department desires to avoid giving the impression at this
                        time that the United States is re-examining its position in the matter.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy is requested to report by telegram the results of any discussions
                        that may be undertaken pursuant to this instruction.</p>

                        Narrow Breadth of the Territorial Sea”, enclosed as Enclosure C to the
                        reference instruction.<note n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">Not printed.</note></p>
                    <p>The Embassy has discretion as to whether representations based on the
                        memorandum are made and the extent of such representations. However, the
                        Department hopes the Embassy will make the representations in the absence of
                        over-riding circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The paragraphs which follow are for the Embassy’s general guidance in its
                        consideration of the problem.</p>
                    <p>Section I of the memorandum deals with the effects upon maritime trade and
                        commerce of an extension of the territorial sea. These are the
                        considerations of a general character which are mentioned in the reference
                        instruction as among those demonstrating why it is in the interest of the
                        individual states to support the three-mile rule. Sections II, III and IV
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d292fn3">These sections dealt, respectively, with
                            the effects on neutrality, military and naval operations, and air
                            operations.</note> deal with the effects of such an extension upon
                        international stability and the security of the nations of the free world.
                        The considerations set forth in these three sections are basic to the
                        position of the United States on the question of the <pb n="600"
                            xml:id="pg_600" facs="0626"/>breadth of the territorial sea and to its
                        decision vigorously to support the three-mile rule at the forthcoming
                        Conference on the Law of the Sea.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the importance of the security considerations in the position
                        of the United States on the territorial sea issue, the Department recognizes
                        that political and other factors in some countries may make it undesirable
                        to introduce them into the discussions. In other countries it may be
                        desirable to cast the arguments of the memorandum in a different form.</p>
                    <p>In general the security considerations are particularly appropriate for
                        pre-Conference discussions in countries that are tied to the United States
                        by military agreement but whose position on the breadth of the territorial
                        sea differs or may differ at the Conference from that of the United States.
                        It is evident, however, that even in the case of countries that consider
                        that their security interests fully parallel those of the United States,
                        considerable variation is to be expected in the reaction to the points
                        covered by the memorandum. The Embassy may consider that one or more of the
                        points should be omitted. Attention is directed in particular in this latter
                        connection to the first two paragraphs of Section III which relate to
                        “Intelligence Collection”.</p>
                    <p>It is not intended by the preceding paragraph to exclude all the so-called
                        “neutral” countries. The Missions in certain of these countries may find
                        appropriate uses for the memorandum, particularly Section II relating to the
                        preservation of neutrality.</p>
                    <p>In all cases where the memorandum is used, care should be taken to avoid
                        giving the impression that the position of the United States on the
                        maintenance of the three-mile rule rests solely on the considerations set
                        forth in the memorandum. As indicated in the reference instructions, the
                        position of the United States in maintaining that valid reasons have not
                        been advanced justifying a change in the existing rule of international law
                        on the breadth of the territorial sea has two principal aspects: that there
                        are weighty reasons in the general interest (maritime trade and commerce and
                        free world security) for retaining the three-mile rule and, second, that the
                        national interests which have led to claims for a greater distance can be
                        met by more effective methods (international cooperation for conservation
                        along the lines of the <gloss target="#t_ILC1">ILC</gloss> fisheries
                        articles) than an extension of the territorial sea.</p>
                    <p>It is not the present intention of the Departments of State and Defense to
                        send visiting teams for special briefings to the field as was done in the
                        latter part of 1956 (see <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>–316, October 26,
                        1956). Consideration, nevertheless, will be given to the views of the
                        Embassy should it deem it desirable to have supplemental briefings by means
                        of a field visit.</p>
                    <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0627"/>
                    <p>As a measure which could usefully supplement the presentation of the case
                        made in the reference memorandum, the Department of Defense has developed
                        colored slides and explanatory material which graphically illustrate the
                        security consequences, in terms of restrictions upon navigation and on naval
                        operations, of an extension of the territorial sea. It is believed that the
                        slides would be helpful in visually demonstrating the validity of the
                        principal considerations of the memorandum. The possibility of having the
                        slides duplicated in a manner suitable for showing to foreign officials by
                        Embassy personnel is being explored. It is the Department’s hope that copies
                        will be available for pouching in the near future to the Embassies that are
                        likely to rely extensively on the “Factors” memorandum in the briefings. It
                        is not suggested, however, that discussions on the basis of the memorandum
                        be postponed until the slides are received.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy is requested to report as soon as possible significant reaction
                        to any representations made on the basis of the memorandum.</p>

                    <p>With further reference to the Department’s circular instruction of November
                        8, some additional material is provided with a view to obtaining the support
                        of landlocked countries. It should be noted that the resolution of the
                        United Nations General Assembly convoking the conference on the law of the
                        sea refers specifically to the special problems of landlocked states and
                            recommends"…<note n="2" xml:id="d293fn2">Ellipsis in the source
                            text.</note> that <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0628"/>the
                        conference should study the question of free access to the sea of landlocked
                        countries, as established by international practice or treaties”.</p>
                    <p>At the present time, twelve landlocked countries have been invited to attend
                        the Geneva Conference; they are Afghanistan, Austria, Bolivia,
                        Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Laos, Luxembourg, Nepal, Paraguay, San Marino,
                        Switzerland, and the Vatican City. The interest of these countries in the
                        law of the sea has been chiefly centered on the problem of access to the
                        high seas, and the problem of enjoyment of the freedom of the seas on an
                        equal footing with the coastal states. A closely related problem, and one of
                        considerable interest to landlocked countries, is the right to fly a
                        maritime flag and to register vessels in a maritime register.</p>
                    <p>In the past, the problem of access to the sea for landlocked countries was
                        solved mainly through the creation of port-facilities for the use of
                        landlocked countries and the internationalization of waterways giving access
                        to the sea. Examples of the former are Section XI of the Peace Treaty of
                        Versailles which created the Free City of Danzig, thereby giving Poland the
                        use of a port, and the 1947 Peace Treaty with Italy which provides for a
                        customs free port in the Free Territory of Trieste with facilities available
                        on equal terms for various countries including the landlocked states of
                        Central Europe. With respect to access to the sea through waterways, Article
                        331 of the Versailles Treaty declared the Elbe, Oder, Niemen and Danube
                        Rivers to be international. Also of interest to landlocked countries is the
                        “Convention and Statute on the Regime of Navigable Waterways of
                        International Concern” drawn up in Barcelona in 1921. In addition, Article
                        273 of the Treaty of Versailles recognized the right of landlocked countries
                        to have a maritime flag and a maritime register for their vessels; the text
                        of this Article was subsequently made the subject of the “Declaration
                        Recognizing the Right to a Flag of States having no Seacoast,” opened for
                        signature at Barcelona, April 20, 1921. The above are cited merely as
                        examples of some arrangements which have been made to accommodate the
                        interests of landlocked countries.</p>
                    <p>The United Nations International Law Commission in its articles concerning
                        the law of the sea, in Article 27, states that the high seas are open to all
                        nations and, in Article 28, that every state has the right to sail ships
                        under its flag on the high seas.</p>
                    <p>A number of landlocked countries already have indicated their interest in the
                        Commission’s drafts. Austria and Nepal have expressed general satisfaction
                        with the Articles produced by the International Law Commission at its
                        seventh session. Again in December of 1956, in the course of the meetings of
                        the Sixth Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, the
                        representatives of the Governments <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0629"
                        />of Afghanistan, Austria, Bolivia, Czechoslovakia, Nepal and Paraguay
                        expressed the interest of their countries in the law of the sea and
                        especially the problem of access to the sea.</p>
                    <p>It is considered desirable that the governments of selected landlocked
                        countries be discreetly sounded out on their potential support of the views
                        of the United States as set forth in the Department’s Circular Instruction
                        of November 8. This might best be accomplished by inquiring whether these
                        countries desire to place before the Conference any resolution of particular
                        interest to them.</p>
                    <p>It should be pointed out to these governments that the views of the United
                        States expressed in the Department’s Circular of November 8 are in keeping
                        with the best interests of landlocked countries. A prime example is the
                        United States position in support of the three-mile territorial sea which
                        was based on numerous legal precedents and the general interest of maximum
                        freedom of navigation and maritime trade. All of these considerations would
                        appear to be equally valid from the point of view of landlocked countries
                        since it behooves nations without a territorial sea to have coastal states
                        restricted to as narrow a territorial sea as possible. In the discretion of
                        the Embassy, the important security factors might also be mentioned.</p>
                    <p>The United States views on conservation, designed to promote the maximum
                        sustainable yield of the living resources of the sea, should also appeal to
                        landlocked states who can only benefit from such a policy.</p>
                    <p>There appears to be some tendency on the part of landlocked states to explore
                        the possibility of acting in unison at the Conference. In this connection,
                        the Afghan delegate to the United Nations has suggested to other landlocked
                        states that they hold a pre-Conference meeting in Vienna from February
                        19–26, 1958.</p>
                    <p>In order to instill in this group an attitude favorable to our views, the
                        Embassy should indicate, at its discretion, interest in their special
                        problems when presenting the United States views set forth in <gloss
                            target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>–4339 of November 8, 1957, by inquiring
                        whether they have any measures aimed at solving their special problems which
                        they would like the United States to consider prior to the Conference.</p>

                            Sea</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>At the end of the instruction under reference the Department requested posts
                        receiving the instruction only for information to estimate the attitude of
                        the governments to which they are accredited towards the proposal set forth
                        by the instruction. This was that, in an effort to enlist the support of a
                        greater number of states for a three-mile limit on territorial waters, there
                        might be adopted an arrangement by which a contiguous zone extending perhaps
                        nine miles out to sea beyond the three-mile limit might be reserved to the
                        exclusive jurisdiction of the adjacent state for purposes of fisheries, but
                        for nothing else.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet position on these matters has presumably been made clear at the
                        various sessions of the International Law Commission<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d294fn2">S.B. Krylov was the Soviet Member on the International
                            Law Commission.</note> at which a “draft” convention on these maritime
                        problems has been prepared. No official Soviet statements have recently been
                        made on this subject, but an article appearing in the June 1957 issue of the
                        authoritative magazine <hi rend="italic">Soviet State and Law</hi> reviews
                        the general field and reiterates the well-known Soviet stand.</p>
                    <p>It is obvious that the USSR will remain adamant on the question of a 12-mile
                        limit for territorial waters. The article notes that this boundary was first
                        established by Soviet decree on May 28, 1918, and that the Soviet Government
                        has not deviated from this delineation since that time. It is further
                        alleged that less than a third of the nations of the world have agreed to a
                        three-mile limit (20 out of 71) and that the maritime European People’s
                        Democracies have adopted the 12-mile limit (except for 10 miles in the case
                        of Albania). The magazine states that, in general, nations should be free to
                        decide on the limits of their own territorial waters on the basis of
                        historical tradition and in consonance with the demands of national security
                        and economics.</p>
                    <p>The firmness of the Soviet stand in this matter is indicated by the fact that
                        Moscow has chosen to denounce the supporters of a narrow three-mile zone as
                        the major imperialistic powers of the <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605"
                            facs="0631"/>world. Their interest in this matter is said to stem from
                        their desire to be able to penetrate close to the shores of other states to
                        exploit the off-shore maritime resources of those countries, especially when
                        the latter are underdeveloped, as well as to be able legally to send their
                        warships close to the coasts of small countries so as to conduct threatening
                        naval demonstrations. Since the question of a three versus a 12-mile limit
                        has thus been framed in terms of the cold war, the Soviet Union can hardly
                        be expected to retreat from its position, and it is exceedingly unlikely
                        that it would modify its stand even if the great majority of nations could
                        be persuaded to adopt some common demarcation of the belt of territorial
                        waters in a width substantially less than 12 miles.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Soviet State and Law</hi> is also quite insistent on the
                        proposition that within the area of territorial waters, however defined, a
                        state exercises absolute sovereignty in the same sense that it does over
                        terra firma. This is brought out in the article’s denunciation of the
                        theories of certain “bourgeois” legal experts who contend that a state
                        exercises only the rights of “police control” or “supervision” over
                        territorial waters but no more, which in the Soviet view would mean that a
                        nation would be required to allow foreigners to exploit fish and other
                        resources in territorial waters on the same basis as it permitted its own
                        citizens to do so.</p>
                    <p>While the foregoing would seem to dispose effectively of any idea that the
                        Soviets might look favorably on the Canadian proposal noted in the
                        instruction under reference in so far as two successive off-shore seaward
                        zones of three and nine miles respectively are concerned, it should be added
                        that the USSR may favor the idea of granting exclusive fishing rights in
                        contiguous waters beyond the fixed territorial limit, which in their case
                        would be 12 miles. In fact, the article offers two criteria for the
                        determination of such fishing zones when it suggests that they can be
                        justified either because the fish obtained are extremely important to the
                        food supply of the particular country (although not specified, Japan may be
                        a case in point) or because the presence of fish in these waters is a result
                        of measures taken by the particular state to propagate them (as in the case
                        of salmon). The article, however, tends to be somewhat vague on the question
                        of extreme claims of a width of up to 200 miles for territorial waters based
                        on the seaward extension of the continental shelf, and it is likely that the
                        Soviet Government would generally not be willing to support such a
                        stand.</p>

                    <p>The Department is very concerned over recent indications that some posts may
                        have the erroneous impression the United States is actively working to
                        defeat the Canadian-type proposal for a special contiguous zone for fishery
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that the Government is maintaining an open mind and has not
                        determined its position on this particularly vital issue. Indeed, one of the
                        principal purposes of these preliminary discussions with other governments
                        is to elicit their attitudes and reactions to such proposals so that the
                        United States will be able to intelligently assess the situation and arrive
                        at a definitive position later.</p>
                    <p>If any officials of foreign governments have been led to believe the United
                        States is at this stage endeavoring to scuttle any such proposal, or that
                        the United States has no final position one way or the other on the issue,
                        the Embassy should utilize the earliest opportunity to remove that mistaken
                        impression as discreetly as possible. If discussions of the fisheries
                        contiguous zone problem are to be profitable to the United States, they must
                        be conducted in a manner which will elicit the other nation’s own evaluation
                        of the issue.</p>
                    <p>Report soonest any further reactions to this problem.</p>

                        requesting submission of a statement of the Department’s interests and
                        requirements relative to the United States Antarctic expedition being
                        planned for the 1955/56 season. Reply has been delayed beyond January 15, in
                        view of the absence of any requirements of the kind necessitating
                        reservations of space on the expedition. The following, however, is a
                        summary of this Department’s interests in such expeditions.</p>
                    <p>The interests of the Department of State in Antarctica expeditions are
                        largely derived from other United States interests in that region as they
                        affect our foreign relations. Such interests can hardly be stated completely
                        except in relation to the plans of other departments and agencies. For this
                        reason the process of determining, through the Operations Coordinating
                        Board, what activities will be undertaken on the next expedition is of
                        particular importance to this Department. General comment may be useful,
                        however, on the ways in which foreign relations become involved.</p>
                    <p>The general interests of the United States require that our Antarctic rights
                        be protected and advanced as much as possible, within the limits of our best
                        judgment of the possible future worth of the Antarctic. On the other hand,
                        the damage to our relations with other countries from some kind of
                        activities could be out of all proportion to the anticipated United States
                        gain. Thus the balance is required in each instance to determine whether the
                        anticipated <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0634"/>benefit to our
                        Antarctic rights and knowledge is sufficient to justify the expected effects
                        upon our foreign relations.</p>
                    <p>It is not likely that tangible returns from our efforts in Antarctica will be
                        large enough in the foreseeable future to make large expenditures seem
                        worthwhile. If disillusionment with the lack of “profit” from the venture
                        should cause a sharp curtailment, the expenditures already made might be
                        largely wasted as far as strengthening United States rights is concerned. In
                        the interests of continuity of national effort, therefore, it is highly
                        important not to “over-sell” the Antarctic in an effort to obtain popular
                        support or to burden the Antarctic program with activities which have no
                        essential relation to the acquisition of needed information not obtainable
                        elsewhere or to the necessary maintenance of United States rights. As has
                        already been seen, large-scale Antarctic activity by the United States tend
                        to call forth greater competitive efforts from other countries, with the
                        possible result of destroying the net advantage the United States had hoped
                        to gain.</p>
                    <p>To some extent these are problems of properly choosing the areas in which
                        United States expeditions will operate, in relation to the areas of
                        operations and claims of friendly countries. This problem cannot be settled
                        under present circumstances by marking out areas in which United States
                        operations would be permitted or forbidden. The areas of operations for
                        1955/56, as now understood, are not expected to cause serious difficulties
                        with other countries. An approach to the general problem is proposed in the
                        paper submitted January 21, which is now before the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"

                                Affairs on February 10 to discuss future plans for U.S. expeditions

                        “Antarctica,” covering the period from July 16, 1954 through November 30,
                        1954. On February 9, 1955, the Operations Coordinating Board concurred in
                        the Progress Report for transmittal to the National Security Council.</p>
                    <p>In considering the report it should be noted that the traditional policy of
                        the United States has been to reserve its “rights” in the Antarctic (which
                        do not necessarily carry with them sovereignty) instead of announcing
                        “claims” which might be a basis of establishing sovereignty. The advantage
                        of relying upon “rights,” as contrasted with “claims,” is that flexibility
                        is maintained as our ultimate areas of claim while we learn more about the
                        area through scientific and other work <hi rend="italic">in any part</hi> of
                        Antarctica, as could anyone else, and while we avoid or at least postpone
                        open disputes over territorial claims by nations friendly to us. The
                        disadvantages are that other countries, including those not now having
                        claims, through exploration and the maintenance of stations in the area, may
                        gradually establish stronger claims to sovereignty and confine the United
                        States to an area not now claimed by any other country.</p>
                    <p>One of the principal problems now is to keep unfriendly nations, particularly
                        the Soviet [Union], from establishing any claim whatsoever to any part of
                        the region. All of the seven claimants (Argentina, Chile, Great Britain,
                        Australia, New Zealand, France and Norway) are friendly to the United
                        States. Thus, if the Antarctic were divided among these claimants and
                        sovereignty established by them, there would be none left unclaimed for the
                        Soviet. If the principle of mere reservation of “rights” is maintained
                        indefinitely, it is possible that the Soviets will benefit by the fact that
                        new <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0636"/>claimants are not excluded.
                        They might establish a scientific station somewhere on the continent and
                        make a claim. Even if they do not succeed in establishing a claim, their
                        presence might be equally detrimental to our interests.</p>
                    <p>In its operations and activities in Antarctica, the United States should
                        recognize that at some time it may be desirable to abandon the current U.S.
                        policy of mere reservation of “rights.” The U.S. must be alert to recognize
                        such a situation and should be ready at the appropriate moment to explore
                        the desirability of agreements with the other seven claimants which would
                        seek (a) to freeze out any further claimants, (b) to settle conflicting
                        claims among the claimants, and (c) to permit the United States to carry out
                        in all of Antarctica all of the mapping, scientific expeditions and other
                        activities which would have been possible under reservation of “rights,”
                        while not necessarily attempting to base claims on all such activities in
                        all areas.</p>

                    <p>1. The interest in the Antarctic shown by other countries has increased
                        sharply in the past several months, probably as a result of plans for the
                        International Geophysical Year, 1957-58, and of the renewal of U.S.
                        activities. The plans of other countries include the establishment of bases
                        on the continent where such bases had not previously been permanently
                        maintained and the exploration of the presently unknown interior. Such
                        activities tend to require still greater and more extensive U.S. efforts if
                        we are effectively to compete in the maintenance and extension of Antarctic
                        rights in the whole continent. At the same time such activities narrow our
                        freedom of choice concerning areas of eventual claim and broaden the areas
                        of potential conflict between the U.S. and friendly countries.</p>
                    <p>2. Recent developments thus present a need to determine questions which have
                        arisen in the operations and planning required for the implementation of

                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Background</hi></p>
                    <p>3. The strength of U.S. rights in the Antarctic can be gauged only by
                        comparing them with the rights of other countries, according to rules which
                        are by no means yet agreed upon. It is fairly certain, however, that any
                        legal settlement would give weight to both the formal acts by which nations
                        indicate their intention to <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0638"/>claim
                        sovereignty and the priority, intensity and continuity of national
                        activities in the region.</p>
                    <p>4. The U.S. is the only country of the eight primarily interested in the
                        Antarctic which does not have an official claim dating back one or more
                        decades. In any controversy over the significance of an early statement of
                        claims, the seven friendly claimants would tend to be arrayed against the
                        U.S. (and the USSR, if it should make a claim).</p>
                    <p>5. It has thus far been considered impossible, from a foreign relations and
                        psychological viewpoint, to announce a U.S. claim extensive enough to
                        include all existing U.S. rights. Such rights virtually circle the continent
                        and undoubtedly will be extended by future U.S. expeditions; it may,
                        however, be doubted whether we will ever find it desirable to announce a
                        claim to all.</p>
                    <p>6. Irrespective of prospects for an official U.S. claim, the relative
                        strength of all existing U.S. rights can be maintained only by matching the
                        Antarctic activities of each of the seven countries with which we presently
                        compete for Antarctic rights. In the past we have excelled all other
                        countries in certain areas in respect to certain transitory types of
                        activity, such as aerial photography.</p>
                    <p>7. U.S. plans for the <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> call for
                        establishment of three U.S. stations in the presently unclaimed section
                        (90°–150° West), and possibly a fourth in an area (Weddell Sea) claimed by
                        Argentina and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> but most extensively
                        explored by an American. One or more of these stations could be continued
                        permanently. There is also strong sentiment for undertaking a large-scale
                        program of aerial photography and mapping of the unknown interior half of
                        the continent.</p>
                    <p>8. To carry forward this program while at the same time trying to match the
                        activities of other countries in areas already explored would impose an
                        additional annual financial burden on the Government which would be
                        difficult to defend in terms of prospects for tangible returns in the
                        foreseeable future. If such activities had to be sharply curtailed or
                        abandoned after a time for lack of public support, the end result would be
                        the impairment of U.S. rights relative to those of countries maintaining a
                        steady, though modest, tempo of activity in the Antarctic.</p>
                    <p>9. In the past the U.S. has operated on the theory that it should await the
                        acquisition of additional information of its various parts, before defining
                        the limits of its interests. As a practical matter, however, it may be many
                        years before we possess detailed knowledge of the region (much less the
                        techniques to exploit it) sufficient to make that judgment. Meanwhile, our
                        ability to acquire such information in the interior is in direct competition
                        with our desire to halt the deterioration of our rights in the coastal
                        areas.</p>
                    <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0639"/>
                    <p>10. The general situation commends an early resolution of conflicts between
                        U.S. rights and those of friendly countries. Such a resolution is essential
                        if the U.S. is to frame a coherent program of Antarctic exploration and
                        observations geared to a reliable estimate of long-term interests and
                        capacity.</p>
                    <p>11. Any plan for definition of U.S. interests in the Antarctic should take
                        into consideration the desirability of arousing the least opposition from
                        friendly countries and should contemplate obtaining, if possible, the prior
                        acquiescence of other claimants. Negotiations of this type could hardly be
                        expected to succeed in toto in the near future.</p>

                    <p>12. The Department of State proposes to enter into bilateral negotiations
                        with the seven Antarctic claimant countries (Argentina, Chile, the <gloss

                        to obtain their recognition of superior U.S. rights in certain areas
                        (indicated on the map attached to this report) in return for U.S. agreement
                        not to contest their individual claims in the remaining areas.</p>
                    <p>13. The problem of negotiations toward a definition of U.S. interests and
                        resolution of conflicting claims involves several elements depending upon
                        the parts of the region being considered: <list>

                                than a few hundred miles, from 150° West, westward to about 20° West
                                (plus Heard Island), U.S. rights are in conflict with single
                                claimants (New Zealand, Australia, France and Norway) which
                                recognize each others’ claims. U.S. rights here are significant, but
                                scattered. Communications between parts of this area would be
                                difficult by sea, surface or air, because the coastal distance from
                                one end to the other is about 5,000 miles, and the straight-line
                                distance about 2,000 miles. In the vast unexplored interior of those
                                claims, but mainly the Australian and Norwegian (Part of Area C) the
                                U.S. probably could acquire superior rights in the near future by
                                carrying out its plan for aerial photography and mapping. <hi

                                complicated by the fact that the U.S. could not recognize any one of
                                the claims in the areas where they <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614"

                                Alexander I Island). The alternative presented to these three

                        </list></p>
                    <p>14. While such negotiations, if successful, will tend to set the limits of
                        any future U.S. claims, no specific recommendation for announcement of a
                        claim can be made until the results of the negotiations are known.</p>
                    <p>15. The advantage of this proposal lies partly in the fact that it would not
                        require disruption of the major areas of present and past activities of
                        other claimants. They should find it easy to “give up” to the U.S. those
                        areas which are largely unexplored, in exchange for U.S. recognition of (or
                        non-objection to) their claims. It would give the U.S., on the other hand, a
                        large area, accessible from several directions and just as likely to be of
                        value in the future as the areas of its existing rights.</p>
                    <p>16. This plan also has advantages as a counter to any Soviet attempt to
                        obtain a foothold in the region. The present fluidity of the territorial
                        situation, maintained largely by U.S. policies, constitutes an invitation to
                        additional claimants. Removal of potential conflicts among friendly powers
                        would, moreover, reduce the opportunity for trouble-making between claimants
                        by supporting one against the other. An approach to eventual “partition” of
                        the region would leave no portion of the continent outside the cognizance of
                        at least one of the eight friendly claimants. U.S. rights in the coastal
                        areas need not be abandoned in relation to outside powers and, ultimately
                        could be formally ceded to the friendly powers to strengthen their
                        respective claims against outside encroachment.</p>
                    <p>17. To summarize, the foregoing plan would help to insure that the U.S.

                                reduction of international friction, and the orderly solution of the
                                territorial problem among friendly powers” (Paragraph 9 b., <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5424/1). The U.S. would attempt to
                                remove itself from the most strongly contested areas without, at
                                this time, trying to settle disputes among Argentina, Chile and the
                                United Kingdom. Successful negotiations along the lines proposed
                                would also “reassert U.S. ‘rights’ in the Antarctic” (Paragraph 9
                                a.) in selected areas more effectively than is possible by other
                                means, and at the same time move toward the establishment of
                                specific claims. In the remaining areas U.S. rights would be yielded
                                in favor of friendly claimants, without abandoning them as regards
                                present non-claimants, thus helping to “exclude our most probable
                                enemies” (Paragraph 6). Decisions relating to an eventual U.S. claim
                                must await the outcome of the proposed negotiations. To the degree
                                they are successful, however, the negotiations will set the limits
                                of any future U.S. claim in competition with present claimants.<note

                    <p>In the course of the meeting Mr. Barbour said that he was not convinced of
                        the need for the proposed bilateral negotiations in which the U.S. would
                        “trade” its rights in certain areas for those of other countries in other
                        parts of the Antarctic. Unless the need was overriding for a move in the
                        direction of a U.S. claim, he would prefer to acquiesce in the Department of
                        Defense request, particularly since it was providing the money for U.S.
                        activities in the Antarctic.</p>
                    <p>I replied that no overwhelming case could be made for starting the
                        negotiations now. Events in Antarctica, due to the nature of the region,
                        could never be predicted with complete certainty. We could say, however,
                        that we had already delayed too long in making a claim and that our
                        bargaining position relative to those of other countries would continue to
                        deteriorate in the coming year. The international situation, particularly
                        with Argentina, was now favorable where it had not been in the past and
                        might not be next year. We foresaw that next year there probably would be
                        other reasons for not starting negotiations, e.g., avoiding interference
                        with the <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss>. The proposed postponement
                        therefore probably would be for <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0645"
                        />three or four years rather than only one. Mr. Hilliker added that the
                        result of continuing our present policy of reserving rights everywhere would
                        be the eventual limitation of any U.S. claim to the presently unclaimed
                        sector between 90° and 150° w. longitude.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barbour reiterated his earlier position.</p>

                        clarifying our position in a letter.</p>
                    <p>I told the Senator that the Departments concerned had been actively
                        considering for the past several months the question of a possible U.S.
                        claim in the Antarctic, reversing the previous policy of reserving U.S.
                        rights everywhere in the area. We had recently decided to postpone the
                        action for a year during which time U.S. expeditions in the area might
                        obtain additional information upon which we might better select the areas of
                        greatest value to the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Senator supposed that the existence of other countries’ claims also
                        affected the problem. Mr. Godel replied affirmatively and explained that
                        U.S. expeditions would be in the Antarctic over the next several years after
                        a period of several years of U.S. inactivity. <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620"
                            facs="0646"/>He handed the Senator a copy of the “Bluebird” map<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d302fn3">Not further identified.</note> and stated that
                        the coming expeditions would establish five permanent U.S. stations (Little
                        America, Marie Byrd Land, South Pole, McMurdo Sound, and Weddell Sea). The
                        area is of some strategic value, he said, because the Drake Passage is an
                        alternate route around South America in the event the Panama Canal should be
                        disabled. No mineral discoveries had yet been made by the U.S. or any other
                        country which would justify exploitation according to methods thusfar known.
                        Other countries had established bases in the area, particularly around the
                        Palmer Peninsula, which gave them very strong rights. Nevertheless the
                        Administration was definitely moving in the direction of making an official
                        claim.</p>
                    <p>I stated that we planned, once a decision on a claim had been made, to enter
                        into negotiations with other claimants for the mutual recognition of claims.
                        The Senator asked that we keep him informed so that when that time is
                        reached he might introduce a bill for the assertion of a claim. He explained
                        this desire on grounds of personal interest in the Antarctic and implied
                        that he expected the bill would be handled by the Armed Services Committee
                        of which he is a member.</p>

                        from the latest Moscow radio broadcast dealing with the plans of the Soviet
                        Government <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0647"/>for an expedition to
                        Antarctica in connection with the International Geophysical Year. He also
                        emphasized the Planning Board’s judgment that recent Russian interest in
                        Antarctica and other developments suggested the desirability of a review of
                        U.S. policy toward Antarctica.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> referred to the point
                        made in the Progress Report that no single office or unit in the Executive
                        Branch had been given responsibility for coordinating Government policies
                        and programs with respect to Antarctica. He wondered, therefore, whether the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> should refer the problem of
                        organizing such a unit to the Bureau of the Budget and to the President’s
                        Advisory Committee on Government Organization. However, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHJJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out that there was no real
                        conflict or issue among the Government agencies over Antarctica. From the
                        operating point of view this region was preponderantly a Defense Department
                        responsibility, but actually cooperation among all the departments was going
                        ahead so smoothly that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName> could perceive no necessity for placing exclusive
                        concern and responsibility for the affairs of Antarctica in any one
                        Government department or agency. The <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, he
                        believed, was operating very effectively in this field. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> then said he would withdraw his
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName><note n="4"
                            xml:id="d303fn4"><persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Harold Stassen</persName>,
                            Special Assistant to the President for Disarmament.</note> strongly
                        supported the Planning Board’s recommendation for a review of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5424/1, on grounds of what seemed to him
                        the obvious fact that if the Soviets once got a foothold in Antarctica they
                        would never abandon the region. Accordingly, he believed that the U.S. had
                        better set forth its claims in this region before the Soviet expedition
                        arrived.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJJ1">Hoover</persName> commented that the
                        trouble was that if the U.S. staked out formal claims, the situation in
                        Antarctica might become more confused and worse than it was at present, with
                        so many other friendly governments also making claims in the region.</p>
                    <p>General Cabell<note n="5" xml:id="d303fn5">Lieutenant General Charles P.
                            Cabell, U.S.A.F., Deputy Director, Central Intelligence Agency.</note>
                        stressed the significance of the recent Soviet interest in Antarctica. It
                        was, he said, by no means a mere passing interest or one solely in relation
                        to the Geophysical Year.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President commented that all these points added up to the
                        advisability of a review of this policy.</p>

                    <p>Australia is one of seven countries which up to now have had claims or
                        significant interests in Antarctica. She has one permanent station in the
                        area of her claim (see attached map)<note n="4" xml:id="d304fn4">Not
                            printed.</note> and may soon establish another one.</p>
                    <p>United States policy, as established by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> in July 1954, and subsequently developed in the <gloss
                            target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>, is to step up a program of exploration,
                        mapping and scientific investigation, looking toward the formal assertion of
                        a United States claim (which unlike other countries we have never yet made)
                        and eventually to negotiations with other claimant countries to reconcile
                        overlapping claims.</p>
                    <p>This general policy is for the present being implemented as part of our
                        national contribution to the world-wide cooperative scientific enterprise
                        known as “The International Geophysical Year”, to take place in 1957-58.
                        This involves an enormous amount of preparation and planning in the
                        geophysical sciences. Part of this is centered on the Antarctic and there
                        are periodic meetings of scientists, headed up <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623"
                            facs="0649"/>on our side by the National Science Foundation, to plan the
                        details. One of these is now being held in Brussels.</p>
                    <p>We sent an expedition last year on the SS <hi rend="italic">Atka</hi> to
                        explore locations for future stations. Another expedition leaves November 1
                        for New Zealand and thence to Little America, where it will set up an air
                        strip at McMurdo Sound and establish another station in Little America. Both
                        of these are in the sector claimed by New Zealand. We shall in due course
                        establish stations at Points 2 and 3 on the attached map.</p>
                    <p>The USSR, with little previous record of interest in Antarctica, has
                        announced an ambitious program for participation in the <gloss
                            target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> and there are natural fears that her
                        interests are more than scientific. They propose a station on the Knox Coast
                        in the Australian claim… .</p>
                    <p>In order to protect the Australian claim, Mr. Casey may refer to a recent
                        announcement from our people in Brussels as to our plans for the Knox Coast
                        and may say something to the effect that Australia would be glad to give us
                        any cooperation we need in connection with our activities <hi rend="italic"
                            >within her claim.</hi> This kind of statement would be within the
                        customary relationship between us on the one hand, New Zealand and Australia
                        on the other, each seeking to protect whatever claims it has. Our customary
                        reply is to thank them but to point out that we cannot recognize their claim
                        and that we must fully reserve all our own rights.</p>
                    <p>There has been a renewed interest on the part of other claimant countries as
                        to our intentions, because at the time Admiral Dufek (Commander of our
                        Antarctic expedition this fall) was given Rear Admiral rank by Act of
                        Congress in June, 1955, the Committee report referred to a “governmental
                        decision taken in July 1954” and to his expedition as being “to implement
                        the governmental policy on Antarctica.”</p>

                    <p>Mr. Casey opened by saying that Antarctica was particularly important to
                        Australia because the climate of the southern half of their country was
                        affected by the air masses from Antarctica. He said there were strong
                        feelings in Australia in regard to Antarctica and that, from the long range
                        defense point of view they could not afford to have a place which was within
                        aircraft range of Australia in hostile hands. He said there were also
                        certain mineral resources in the area which they had investigated. He
                        referred also to its meteorological importance to Australia and New Zealand.
                        He mentioned that they were on the track of some automatic meteorological
                        recording and transmitting equipment which was being manufactured by a small
                        firm near Paris. If this worked they intended to put a string of stations in
                        along the coast of the sector which they claimed. Later in the conversation
                        he said he had made inquiries in Washington and had been told that we did
                        not have any such equipment ourselves. He asked that we renew our inquiry
                        and let the Australians know if in fact we had any such equipment and with
                        whom the Australians could talk about it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                            >Murphy</persName> said we would undertake to do this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Casey also said that they were in the course of preparing the most
                        detailed map yet made of Antarctica particularly of the area of the
                        Australian claim which he showed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                            >Murphy</persName> on the attached map. He said that Australia had
                        proclaimed a system of law for “our area” and the islands which they
                        claimed. He said they are working very closely with the French. He expressed
                        appreciation for the photographs which we had given them, which had been
                        taken <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0651"/>on the Byrd Expedition.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d305fn2">Reference is presumably to the Antarctic
                            development project code-named “Operation Highjump”, headed by
                                <persName>Richard E. Byrd</persName>, in which American ships,
                            aircraft, and men extensively explored and photographed various portions
                            of Antarctica between December 1946 and February 1947.</note> He
                        referred to their permanent station at Mawson and said they had had another
                        one at Heard Island which they had abandoned because of the lack of
                        resources, but it could be reoccupied at any time. He said they were
                        considering the establishment of another mainland station in the area at
                        Vestfold Hills. He said they were renting a Danish ship and sending an
                        aircraft down to be stationed there.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>Mr. Casey said they had heard rumors that we were reappraising our policy on
                        Antarctica and asked what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
                        could tell him in that connection.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that we did not
                        recognize the validity of any of the claims so far advanced and noted that
                        many of them involved areas in which we also had an interest based on a long
                        history of exploration. He referred to the friction resulting from the
                        conflicting claims of the United Kingdom, Chile and Argentina. He referred
                        also to the 1948 proposal for some form of common sovereignty and to the
                        Soviet injection of its interest at that time.<note n="3" xml:id="d305fn3"

                        He said that at some suitable time we favored negotiation among the seven
                        claiming countries, excluding the USSR, so that conflicting claims could be
                        reconciled.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Casey said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName><note

                        mentioned the same idea of internationalization during his recent visit to
                        Ottawa and that Mr. Casey had opposed it strongly. So far as Australia was
                        concerned, they wanted the status quo. For their part they were progressing
                        with useful scientific work and saw no reason for international action. He
                        did not think there was now much friction.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
                        said that there was nothing imminent so far as our ideas of negotiation were
                        concerned, and, in response to Mr. Casey’s request for consultation, said
                        that we would, of course, consult with them in due course when we had
                        anything specific in mind.</p>

                        included Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        and Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HHJJ1">Hoover</persName>

                        Leslie Munro for New Zealand. According to the United States Minutes of the
                        meeting, Casey raised the issue of Antarctica at the conclusion of the
                        meeting: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Mr. Casey then raised the question of Antarctica. He said that since
                                his talk with the Acting Secretary on September 14 there had been
                                new developments. The Russians had exposed their plans for future
                                activities in Antarctica. These plans envisaged regular flights of
                                aircraft to Antarctica, probably as many as five or six a year. …
                                Mr. Casey said that Australians hoped that the U.S., <gloss
                                    target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>, New Zealand and Australia could
                                get together to concert their positions with regard to
                                Antarctica.</p>
                            <p>“… Australia felt that there should be the fullest talks before any
                                new developments occur.</p>
                            <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJJ1">Hoover</persName> explained the
                                U.S. position prior to <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>
                                interest in the area.… The U.S. was now gathering material for a
                                reassessment of its policy but was not yet in a position to discuss
                                the matter authoritatively.” (Department of State, Conference Files:

                    <p>We can well understand the interest caused by our activities in the
                        Antarctic. Any and all U.S. activities are considered by us, in addition to
                        their immediate practical objectives, which in the scientific field
                        particularly are of benefit to other friendly countries as well as to
                        ourselves, as measures to support the overall U.S. position.</p>
                    <p>This position is one in which, as the Australian Government well knows, the
                        U.S. does not recognize any of the claims so far advanced and reserves all
                        rights arising out of U.S. activities. We recognize that this is a position
                        which may occasionally be construed as competition with the claims of other
                        nations but, under present circumstances, we see no way which that situation
                        can be avoided.</p>
                    <p>The immediate practical objectives sought in our Antarctic activities are in
                        conjunction with and in support of the International Geophysical Year,
                        exploration, geography, and the earth sciences. The flights in question will
                        contribute to this knowledge. In addition, they will permit, we hope, the
                        determination of ice conditions immediately before the movement of ships
                        into the area, current <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0655"/>weather data
                        and a more precise analysis of the origins of weather in the Antarctic. The
                        scientific data which can be obtained on upper air conditions will be of use
                        to the over-all scientific endeavor planned for the International
                        Geophysical Year. Such aerial photography as may be produced as a result of
                        these flights will contribute to the geographic knowledge of the Antarctic
                        continent. It is, of course, our intention to make all of these data and
                        materials available to interested friendly countries including Australia who
                        desire them.</p>
                    <p>It is, of course, also true that the interest of the Soviet Union in the
                        Antarctic presents a problem in which we are all concerned. It will be
                        recalled that initially under the program for the International Geophysical
                        Year the United States planned only three or four stations, none of which
                        would have been located within the Australian claimed sector. When it was
                        learned in July that the Soviets would be placing a station on the Knox
                        Coast, the United States agreed at the International Conference in Brussels
                        to establish a similar station to help offset any possible political
                        consequences of Soviet action by insuring the presence of other countries
                        (including the United States) which have a history of past activity in the
                        general area. In view of the fact that we could not establish a station
                        before the arrival of the Russians, the Department of Defense proposed the
                        flights in question, in addition to the more important reasons which I have
                        just mentioned, as a partial substitute. The State Department could see no
                        objection to the project and considered it a routine operation fully
                        consistent with our previous policies and actions. Because the flights were
                        not the result of any new national policy decision, we did not take the
                        initiative for consultation on the survey flight through diplomatic
                        channels. However, because of the concern over the project, and the
                        regrettable lapse over the initial press release, we are now sorry that we
                        did not explain the entire project fully at the outset through diplomatic
                        channels.</p>
                    <p>It is, incidentally, not yet certain that, following the report of the survey
                        party, we shall actually be able to undertake the proposed flights. It is
                        expected that it will be possible to make a decision on this point within
                        the next few days and we shall be in touch with the Australian Embassy in
                        due course.</p>

                                of Strategic Air Command aircraft: 1) the operations could not begin
                                until early December, 2) inadequate coverage by surface vessels and
                                lack of other facilities caused serious jeopardy of life, and 3) the
                                cost of such operation was $4 million over and above expenditures

                        that for the reasons we discussed the present operation by the Strategic Air

                    <p>However, in view of the desire of the Department of State that all possible
                        efforts be made to obtain “first sightings” and mapping data in that area
                        where the Soviets are expected to install their base and from which they
                        will conduct their operations, we have requested the Department of the Navy
                        to instruct its expeditionary Task Force to reschedule its mapping flights
                        so as to anticipate what we judge to be the most probable time of the Soviet
                        effort.</p>

                        operations, however, we would appreciate it if the Department of State would
                        initiate such diplomatic action as may be feasible to persuade the
                        governments of Australia, Argentina, and South Africa to delay or withhold
                        permission for Soviet flight operations from bases within their
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>We recognize, of course, that such action might involve other diplomatic
                        considerations which would make a direct approach to these governments

                    <p>We are concerned over reports which have been received indicating that the
                        Soviet Union may formally request the use of base facilities in the Southern
                        Hemisphere in support of the Soviet Antarctic program during the
                        International Geophysical Year. Our concern is motivated by fears that the
                        Soviet interest will not be limited to that period. The use of such
                        facilities has other strategic significance, and we should like to see that
                        a coordinated policy toward a possible request for base facilities be
                        adopted by those most likely to be approached. The addressee missions are
                        therefore instructed to approach at an appropriate level the governments to
                        which they are accredited, in formally conveying the following:<note n="2"

                                International Geophysical Year. We do not yet know whether Soviet
                                activity in the Antarctic is motivated by real scientific interest
                                or whether it heralds an attempt at permanent occupation of a
                                portion of the Antarctic. We feel sure that our friends and allies
                                who have a traditional interest in the Antarctic Continent share our
                                concern over the latter possibility.</p>
                            <p>“The United States has learned that the Soviet Union has informally
                                requested assistance at recent <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss>
                                meetings in the nature of landing rights at airfields as stopping
                                points for planes en route to the Antarctic. We believe that the
                                extension of such assistance would be contrary to the interest of
                                all having an interest in the Antarctic unless we can be assured
                                that the main Soviet interest is connected with the International
                                Geophysical Year and thus limited in its duration.</p>

                            <item>Antarctica is not readily accessible even during the brief
                                Antarctic “summer” and much of it has never been seen or explored.
                                In the past it has been thought to have little or no economic
                                importance and only remote strategic significance. Antarctica has
                                considerable immediate importance for scientific purposes; our
                                understanding of the physical structure of the world and its
                                atmosphere will be materially advanced by data obtainable only in
                                Antarctica. Moreover, Antarctica may have other potential values not
                                now determinable, so that its importance could conceivably increase
                                greatly with additional knowledge and new technical developments.
                                Furthermore, the recent Soviet decision to send expeditions to the
                                Antarctic is evidence of the interest the Soviets have in the area
                                and the importance they attach to it. This development is a cause
                                for concern to the U.S. and its friends and allies in the Southern
                                Hemisphere.</item>

                            <item>Formal claims to Antarctic territory have been made by the
                                Governments of Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand,
                                Norway and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> The U.S. has
                                neither recognized any of these claims nor made any official claim
                                of its own, but has consistently sought to reserve all its “rights”.
                                The USSR has made no Antarctic claims but has asserted a right to
                                participate in any territorial settlement on the basis of the
                                claimed discovery of the continent by Bellingshausen in
                                1820–21.</item>

                            <item>The U.S. has a basis for claims to major areas in all of
                                Antarctica, as the result of discovery, exploration and unofficial
                                claims made on behalf of the U.S. The areas in which the U.S. has
                                been active lie with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>,
                                Argentine, Chilean, Australian and New Zealand claims, as well as
                                within an unclaimed sector (90°W–150°W). Formal claims and sustained
                                activities by other claimants now threaten to weaken the basis for
                                U.S. claims in almost all parts of Antarctica.</item>

                            <item>In view of the long history of U.S. activity, public interest, and
                                the possibility that the Antarctic may later assume an importance
                                which is not now apparent, it would be inadvisable to allow U.S.
                                “rights” to deteriorate. The fact that other countries have long
                                standing claims in the Antarctic while the U.S. has none will weaken
                                any claim the U.S. may advance in the future. On the other hand we
                                do not have sufficient knowledge about the continent to permit an
                                informed choice of the best locations for U.S. claims now. Moreover,

                                forward U.S. claims must take into account (a) the possibility of

                            <item>It may be of future strategic importance to the free world that
                                the Soviet bloc have no control over any portion of Antarctica. From
                                the standpoint of countering Soviet activities and future claims,
                                either of the two courses of action involving U.S. claims
                                (Alternative B or C) would be superior to the continued reservation
                                of U.S. “rights” (Alternative A). It must be recognized that,
                                however the U.S. acts, the Soviets are likely to make future claims
                                based on activity (including conceivably <gloss target="#t_IGY1"
                                    >IGY</gloss> activity), and cannot be prevented from doing so
                                or, in the near future at least, physically barred from the
                                subcontinent. However, a U.S. claim before the Soviets establish a
                                basis for claim, would set up a legal position opposed to that of
                                the Soviets and would permit the U.S. to work in the direction of a
                                common front of claimants. Hence, when the issue of sovereignty
                                finally comes to a head—either in the International <pb n="637"
                                    xml:id="pg_637" facs="0663"/>Court, through arbitration or
                                otherwise—the U.S. would then be in a stronger position to prevent a
                                successful Soviet claim and to establish a structure wholly composed
                                of free world nations. From this standpoint, as between Alternative
                                B and Alternative C, B would be slightly superior, in that U.S.
                                claims in conflict with the existing claims of others would tend to
                                weaken our opposition to later Soviet claims likewise conflicting
                                and likewise based on activity.</item>

                            <item>It should be noted that adoption of either Alternative B or C
                                involving the advancement of formal U.S. claims might conceivably be
                                the first step in embarking the U.S. upon a course of defending vast
                                and remote areas which would be identified as U.S. territory and
                                accepted at home and abroad as requiring protection from trespass or
                                adverse occupation or use by the power and prestige of the U.S. The
                                future consequences of such a course cannot now be clearly

                        <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff are in general agreement, from the military
                            point of view, with the objectives proposed and with the courses of
                            action common to the three alternatives set forth in the draft statement
                            of policy. The basic divergency reflected in the alternative courses of
                            action centers upon the question as to whether the United States should
                            now announce its claims in Antarctica and, if so, to what areas or
                            territories: <list>

                        <item>The military importance of Antarctica, aside from the geographic,
                            might well lie in its hidden scientific secrets and its yet undiscovered
                            strategic materials. Unrestricted and continuing scientific
                            investigation, exploration, and mapping in the Antarctic is essential to
                            arrive at a dependable appraisal of its military worth. Now as in the
                            past, the United States is exercising the right of conducting such
                            activities in areas of its own choice in Antarctica, notwithstanding the
                            “claims” of other nations. An announcement of United States claims to
                            specific areas might well result in a curtailment of this freedom of
                            action. In this connection, United States participation in the
                            International Geophysical Year (<gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss>)
                            includes the establishment over a widespread area. In contrast, nations
                            which have laid formal claims are establishing their stations in
                            Antarctica, in support of the <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss>,
                            within the areas of their respective claims. It is to be noted, however,
                            that: (a) the USSR is establishing stations in <pb n="639"
                                xml:id="pg_639" facs="0665"/>the Antarctic without regard to claims
                            of other nations, and (b) the USSR has advanced no formal claims to
                            areas in the Antarctic. Thus, the USSR and the United States are
                            following similar practices in these respects.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The sizable operations scheduled by the United States and other
                            nations for the next three years (1956–1959), should add considerably to
                            our present inadequate knowledge of Antarctica. The information thus
                            gained, when evaluated, will place the United States in a better
                            position to determine the areas of value to which claim could
                            appropriately be made. A formal claim at this time to areas claimed by
                            other countries, as proposed in Alternative “C”, could lead to
                            international disputes with respect to areas of little or no value to
                            the United States, whereas a further delay might operate to weaken
                            future claims to areas desired. As regards the action proposed in
                            Alternative “B”, it could be misinterpreted as tacit approval of other
                            nations’ claims to the remainder of Antarctica, to the detriment of
                            possible future United States action.</item>

                        <item>After weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative,
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that, on balance and for
                            the present, the course of action under Alternative “A” best serves
                            United States military interests. They consider, however, that the
                            statement of policy specifying this course of action should be modified

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> briefed the Council both
                        on the contents of the proposed revised policy for Antarctica and on the
                        analysis of the accompanying Progress Report on this policy. He then called
                        on Commander <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Mansfield</persName>, <gloss
                            target="#t_USN1">USN</gloss>,<note n="5" xml:id="d313fn5">Commander J.E.
                            Mansfield, Department of the Navy.</note> who, with the help of a map,
                        explained to the National Security Council the various claims made to areas
                        of Antarctica by the several nations, as well as other information germane
                        to Council consideration of policy towards Antarctica.</p>
                    <p>Before the briefing was completed, the President informed Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> that he was going too fast and that
                        he, the President, wanted to ask a question. Who was the geophysical expert
                        present for this discussion? When informed that Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>, head of the National Science
                        Foundation, was the expert in question, the President asked Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> what we could hope to get out of
                        making claims to certain areas of Antarctica in return for the expense which
                        substantiating these claims would involve us in.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> replied that very little
                        was known at the present time with respect to the economic resources of
                        Antarctica. Meteorological data, however, would prove very valuable. The
                        President then suggested that even if mineral deposits were actually found
                        in Antarctica, the cost of their extraction would make their value highly
                        problematical. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> replied
                        that it was hard to say, but that in any case it would be difficult to
                        establish the value of such resources in the short period of activity which
                        we would be engaged in during the International Geophysical Year. The
                        President then called upon the Secretary of State to give his views as to
                        the usefulness of the United States making a claim to various areas in
                        Antarctica.</p>
                    <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0667"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that of course
                        the United States would be confronted by a good many difficulties and
                        problems if it proceeded to make a claim to any such areas.…</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> pointed out that the draft
                        of policy prepared by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board
                        did take cognizance of the question whether to stay where we are, reserving
                        our rights in Antarctica, or to change our policy by making formal claims.
                        The President said to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName>
                        that this was all very well, but before he bought a horse he wanted to know
                        what he was going to do with him besides feed him. After all, only a moment
                        ago we were talking about balancing our budget. Accordingly, the President
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_RAAWUSN1">Admiral</persName> Duncan<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d313fn6">Admiral Donald B. Duncan, Vice Chief of Naval
                            Operations.</note> whether the costs of carrying out our policy in
                        Antarctica for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 were in fact the
                        minimum costs.</p>
                    <p>Admiral Duncan replied in the affirmative, and stated that the financial
                        figures were based on a costing-out of the plans for 1957 by a subcommittee
                        of the Operations Coordinating Board. The costs were confined to the
                        International Geophysical Year activities, to reconnaissance, and to the
                        stations which were to be set up in the Antarctic area. The President then
                        inquired whether the program and the figures had been looked at by the
                        Secretary of Defense. Admiral Duncan said that they had been scanned by
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> very closely.
                        Thereafter, the President stated his opinion that the program should
                        accomplish the objectives sought by the scientists, but there should be no
                        elaborate plans for reconnaissance over and above the scientific needs.</p>
                    <p>Admiral Duncan explained that one of the reasons for the high costs involved
                        in the program stemmed from the fact that there was no precise language
                        which clarified the objectives sought by the policy or limited the scope of
                        operations to be conducted by the United States under this policy. For
                        example, continued Admiral Duncan, no one knew precisely what would be
                        required in order to establish a U.S. claim or claims in Antarctica.
                        Accordingly, if the paper were to be approved, Admiral Duncan suggested
                        clarifying language for its objectives prior to approval.</p>
                    <p>The President said that in his view our policy toward Antarctica should
                        consist in the first place of a reservation of every claim that we might
                        ultimately want to make to areas of Antarctica. Secondly, to do all that we
                        [was] required accomplish our operations under the International Geophysical
                        Year. Beyond this, the President could not see that anything else was
                        needed. Agreeing with the President, Admiral Duncan said that we should
                        carry out our plans to achieve out scientific purposes, but do nothing about
                        establishing claims to Antarctica until we see what is actually revealed
                        about the resources <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0668"/>of the area in
                        the course of carrying out our program for the International Geophysical
                        Year.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>The President again stressed the fact that he was not interested in
                        reconnaissance in Antarctica over and beyond what was required for
                        scientific purposes. He concluded with a reiteration of what he conceived
                        our policy toward Antarctica should be. It was perfectly clear to him that
                        we should first continue to reserve our rights in the area; second, achieve
                        what the scientist wishes to achieve in connection with the International
                        Geophysical Year program; and third, ask the Secretary of State to initiate
                        exploratory conversations with other interested free world countries
                        regarding the possibility of creating a condominium in the area.</p>

                        discussed during the last meeting of <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                        >OCB</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>… The explanatory memorandum has not yet been presented by the Indians to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> secretariat and we have no details on
                        the <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0670"/>Indians proposal. Rumor has it
                        that it involves a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship over the
                        Antarctic.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>Until we have seen the Indian proposal we are not in a position to say
                        whether or not we would favor it. Should we favor a trusteeship we would be
                        going contrary to the views of a number of our friends. The atmosphere
                        surrounding the problem at the moment makes it unlikely that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could contribute to a solution and under
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5424/1 as revised we could not agree
                        to a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship. However, such a solution
                        has merits which should be given full consideration. We would not
                        necessarily oppose such solution and if the Indian proposal takes this form
                        we may have to review our policy again. You will recall the Secretary
                        mentioned this <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> possibility during his
                        briefing before the recent [revision] of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        5424/1.</p>
                    <p>You may wish to pass this on to the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> at
                        its next meeting and say that until the details of the Indian proposition
                        are available we cannot make any useful comment. Each Department should,
                        however, review its thinking on our policy so that we can reach an agreed
                        position if a trusteeship is proposed.</p>

                        views: US position on inscription not yet determined. Indian draft memo
                        helpful in giving US clearer indication Indian objective. While we have not
                        undertaken formulate detailed comments on Indian memo we would like to make
                        certain general observations at this time. We can see no need to raise
                        Antarctica in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at this juncture and believe
                        it politically unwise to do so. While <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        apparently wished avoid raising question territorial claims we doubt if this
                        can be avoided entirely. This could lead to exacerbation existing rivalries
                        among countries having claimed Antarctic territory making even more
                        difficult an eventual solution problem. Moreover, we doubt whether any
                        constructive result likely be obtained. There is freedom of exploration and
                        scientific investigation in Antarctica as evidenced by extent of voluntary
                        cooperation by countries currently participating <gloss target="#t_IGY1"
                            >IGY</gloss> activities there. We fail see legitimate basis for what we
                        understand to be Indian concern over possible use Antarctic region for
                        nuclear testing. As we have indicated previously US has no present intent or
                        plan to use Antarctica as nuclear testing site. Agenda for 11th <gloss
                            target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> already heavy. For these reasons we would
                        hope <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would not press for inscription at
                        this time. We wish underline however US doubts re discussion Antarctica in
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does not mean US has modified its
                        desire further international cooperation Antarctica and Indians probably

                        <p>The Indian government has proposed the inscription of the question of
                            “the peaceful utilization of Antarctica” on the agenda of the 11th
                            General Assembly. In its explanatory memorandum submitted by letter
                            dated October 16, the Indian government suggests that the “General
                            Assembly should call upon all States to agree to and affirm the peaceful
                            utilization of Antarctica for the general welfare and in particular
                            agree that the area shall not be used in any manner that would create or
                            accentuate world tensions, or extend to this area the influence and
                            effects of existing tensions”. The Indians have said that it is not
                            their intention to embroil the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in
                            territorial claims and counterclaims. They reason generally that the
                            Antarctic has considerable strategic, climatic, geophysical and economic
                            significance for the world as a whole, and they wish to obtain
                            international agreement on the peaceful use of the region now because
                            they fear (1) that the manifest intensification of international
                            interest in that region may lead to its becoming a source of East-West
                            tension, and (2) that the area may possibly be used as a nuclear testing
                            site. In response to an Indian request for our comments on their
                            explanatory memorandum while still in draft, we told them that while the
                            US position on inscription has not yet been determined, we see no need
                            to raise Antarctica in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at this
                            juncture and believe it politically unwise to do so and we would hope
                            India would not press for inscription at this time.</p>
                        <p>The reaction of the seven friendly power claimants to territory in the
                            Antarctic to the Indian initiative has been unfavorable. Chile and
                            Argentina are opposed to inscription and we understand that the entire
                            Latin American group has decided to support them. Norway has indicated
                            that it will oppose inscription and that the other Scandinavian
                            countries will likely follow suit. The UK, Australia and New Zealand
                            have all deprecated the Indian initiative and have endeavored without
                            success to persuade the Indians to withdraw the item. These countries
                            have apparently not yet taken a final position on inscription but may
                            oppose together with the older Commonwealth members. France may be
                            expected to oppose as well as <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0674"
                            />certain other Western European countries. After allowance for
                            abstentions, it would appear that the vote on inscription may be close
                            and that the United States position may be determining. Moreover, it is
                            anticipated that the United States will be subjected to considerable
                            pressure from friendly power claimants to oppose inscription,
                            particularly Chile and Argentina on grounds of inter-American
                            commitments and relationships.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe that discussion is precluded by Article 2(7) as argued
                            by Chile and Argentina. Since the United States has consistently refused
                            to recognize claims made by other countries to territory in the
                            Antarctic, we would hardly support a negative position on inscription on
                            grounds that this would constitute domestic intervention. The real
                            problem posed for the United States is whether <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> consideration of the Antarctica item within the limits
                            envisaged by the Indians might adversely affect its national interest in
                            the Antarctic region to an extent that would justify United States
                            opposition to inscription and a further departure from the United States
                            policy of endeavoring generally to favor inscription of items on the
                            Assembly’s agenda, particularly those items which appear to be directed
                            to some extent against the United States.</p>

                        <p>Claims to sovereignty over areas of the Antarctic region, some of which
                            are in conflict, have been advanced by several states, and it may be
                            that further claims will be put forward by other states in the future,
                            particularly within the unclaimed sector. Argentina, Australia, Chile,
                            France, New Zealand, Norway and the UK have all advanced claims to
                            Antarctic territory. The United States, however, has made no official
                            claims to territory in the Antarctic for itself to date and continues to
                            follow the policy of reserving all rights that it or its citizens have
                            in that area. The United States has consistently refused to recognize
                            claims to Antarctic territory made by other countries. On occasion in
                            the past, the United States has specifically rested its refusal to
                            recognize a claim to sovereignty on the ground that discovery alone,
                            unaccompanied by effective occupation of the area in question, cannot
                            support a valid claim to sovereignty. In May, 1955 the UK instituted
                            proceedings before the International Court of Justice against Argentina
                            and Chile, respectively, to secure a declaration by the Court of
                            sovereignty over certain islands and lands in the Antarctic. However,
                            because of the refusal of the Argentine and Chilean governments to
                            accept the Court’s jurisdiction, the cases were dropped.</p>
                        <p>The United States proposed for consideration the establishment of a
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship over the Antarctic in
                            1948, and discussed such an arrangement with the UK, Argentina and
                            Chile. Since this proposal met with some opposition from the British and
                            was not well received in either Argentina or Chile, the United States
                            then suggested for consideration and transmitted to the Argentine,
                            Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway and the UK in early August
                            1948 a draft agreement proposing an international administration
                            (condominium) for the Antarctic whereby the parties would merge and join
                            their claims to and interests in the area in a special regime which
                            would cooperate with appropriate organs and specialized agencies of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Only the UK and New Zealand
                            accepted the proposal as a basis for discussion.</p>
                        <p>Present United States policy objectives in Antarctica call for (1)
                            orderly progress toward a solution of the territorial problem which
                            would ensure control to the United States and friendly powers and
                            exclude its most probable enemies; (2) freedom of exploration and
                            scientific investigation for nationals of the United States and of
                            friendly powers; and (3) access to useful natural resources. The courses
                            of action recommended envisage the reassertion of United States “rights”
                            in the Antarctic while simultaneously seeking an <pb n="650"
                                xml:id="pg_650" facs="0676"/>agreement with the free world claimants
                            to Antarctic territory which will reserve their respective rights
                            pending a future solution of the territorial problems, reduce
                            international friction among them, and permit freedom of exploration and
                            scientific investigation in the Antarctic by free world nationals.
                            Although consideration has been given to the eventual assertion of
                            reasonable claims in the Antarctic as offering the most effective way of
                            protecting existing and potential United States “rights”, no decision to
                            this effect has yet been taken.</p>
                        <p>The passage of a resolution along the lines of that suggested in
                            paragraph 4 of the United States Position would not appear to conflict
                            with, or require any fundamental modification in, present United States
                            policy objectives on Antarctica. However, while the United States may
                            have no objection to affirming its peaceful purposes and intentions in
                            Antarctica in terms of the conduct of its activities in that area in the
                            future, it would consider undesirable the passage of a resolution along
                            the lines proposed by the Indians calling for the peaceful utilization
                            of the Antarctic land mass as such or forbidding the use of Antarctica
                            in a way that will contribute to an increase in world tensions.</p>
                        <p>While there is some disagreement among the principal territorial
                            claimants to Antarctic territory, it is not of such a serious nature to
                            require <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. There has been
                            complete freedom of exploration and scientific investigation in the
                            Antarctic as indicated by the high degree of cooperation manifested
                            between the countries participating in <gloss target="#t_IGY1"
                                >IGY</gloss> activities there. While it is possible that <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of the Antarctica item
                            might tend to exert pressure on friendly powers to resolve their
                            conflicting territorial claims, we think it more likely that it could
                            lead to an airing of differences between free world claimants to the
                            advantage of the USSR, as well as provide the latter with an additional
                            opportunity to try to hinder free world freedom of action in that area.
                            While the USSR has advanced no Antarctic claims as yet, it has asserted
                            its right (1950) to participate in any Antarctic settlement. This does
                            not mean, however, that the USSR might not one day decide to try to
                            assert claims to Antarctic territory, particularly in the unclaimed
                            sector on the basis of Bellingshausen’s expeditions (1819/21) and
                            current Soviet activities in connection with the <gloss target="#t_IGY1"
                                >IGY</gloss>, especially if the United States were to do so.</p>
                        <p>There appears to be little doubt that in the light of present United
                            States policy objectives in the Antarctic and until the future course of
                            United States action in that area has been more precisely defined, the
                            United States should endeavor for the present to limit, to the extent
                                possible,<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of
                            Antarctica in order to maintain the maximum degree of freedom of action
                            for the United <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0677"/>States and
                            friendly power claimants to territory in that area. It is recognized
                            that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration and the adoption of
                            a peaceful uses resolution on Antarctica could lead in due course to
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of other aspects of
                            the Antarctic problem including the question of sovereignty. This in
                            turn might stimulate pressure for internationalization of the Antarctic
                            under some sort of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> administration.
                            Such a development, moreover, could tend to make it increasingly
                            difficult for the United States to depart from its present reserved
                            position and begin the implementation of a national claims policy in the
                            event the United States were to decide to do so.</p>
                        <p>It should also be recognized that United States support for inscription
                            of the Indian item, however explained, would tend to be regarded as
                            having more than procedural significance and as implying that the United
                            States is prepared to acknowledge a present <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> interest in the Antarctic and that it is perhaps
                            disposed to consider the question of Antarctica within the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> framework. United States advocacy of the
                            policy of internationalization of the Antarctic in 1948 would tend to
                            support this implication.</p>
                        <p>In considering our national interest in this question, we believe that we
                            should give considerable weight to the fact that our failure to support
                            the Latin American bloc on this issue would probably be received
                            unfavorably by it and particularly by Chile and Argentina. <gloss
                                target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> has strongly recommended that we
                            support the Latin Americans on this issue on grounds that we will be
                            needing their support badly on other matters at this General
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The type resolution apparently sought by the Indians would likely be
                            interpreted as precluding the use of Antarctica as a nuclear testing
                            site and perhaps the establishment of military bases as well. The United
                            States has taken the position that it has no present intent or plan to
                            use the Antarctic as a nuclear testing site and has so indicated this to
                            the Indians. It is doubted, however, whether United States assurances as
                            regards its <hi rend="italic">present</hi> intentions in this respect
                            will suffice to deter the Indian initiative. On the other hand, it is
                            possible that a United States vote against inscription may tend to
                            weaken our present position on nuclear testing in the Antarctic, lend
                            credence to the Indian concern that we may be contemplating the use of
                            Antarctica for nuclear testing later on, and stimulate further and more
                            determined Indian efforts in this regard.</p>
                        <p>The Indian argument that nuclear testing in the Antarctic region may be
                            criticized as inimical to international welfare through a possible
                            dislocation of the ice cap, etc., is not supported by known scientific
                            evidence. At any rate, we are not aware of any plans to test nuclear
                            weapons there. Neither we nor the other countries involved could accept

                            areas of the world. As for any resolution of the type sought by India on

                        1956. It summarizes the principal developments in the Antarctic and finds

                        <item>The Indian Government withdrew at the last minute the item on
                            Antarctica which they proposed for inscription on the agenda of the
                            present General Assembly. Under this item the Indians had in mind
                            obtaining a United Nations proclamation-type resolution under which
                            member governments would affirm their intention to use the Antarctic for
                            peaceful purposes only, having in mind particularly the possible use of
                            Antarctic regions as sites for nuclear experiment. In withdrawing the
                            item Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> explained
                            that his Government was doing so in order to have time to prepare the
                            item better and to persuade other governments of its importance. It may
                            be assumed, therefore, that the Indians may well re-introduce the
                            subject at a subsequent meeting of the General Assembly. <pb n="653"

                            paragraph 8 of the Progress Report has lost its immediacy, it remains as
                            a problem which is likely to arise in the future.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The portion of the Report of most direct interest to the Department of State
                        is the section contained under paragraph 3 (c) having to do with the
                        negotiation of an agreement among the United States and free-world claimants
                        to territory in the Antarctic. Events during the period under review have
                        not made necessary any formal agreement to maintain existing cooperative
                        relationships in the region. With respect to relations between the UK,
                        Argentina and Chile, which have conflicting claims in the Antarctic, these
                        three Governments on November 21, 1956 renewed their annual agreement not to
                        send warships into the area during the current Antarctic season except for
                        the customary movements. This should minimize the most likely source of
                        friction among the free nations in the region.</p>

                            >ARA</gloss> dated December 4 presents fully the <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        in connection with the Department’s presently contemplated basic review of
                        US policy on Antarctica.</p>
                    <p>Although the Indians withdrew their item on Antarctica from the provisional
                        agenda of the present <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> session, we
                        anticipate that further efforts will be made to raise this item at the 12th
                            <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and we <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654"
                            facs="0680"/>do not believe that we can exclude the possibility that
                        this item might be inscribed. Inasmuch as <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        consideration of Antarctica may have an important bearing on the future
                        course of US action in that area, <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>
                        considers that present US policy objectives in Antarctica should be reviewed
                        in light of this possible eventuality. We believe it likely that <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of Antarctica will inevitably
                        tend to focus attention upon the political aspects of the Antarctica
                        problem. On the one hand, such a development could tend to make it
                        increasingly difficult for the US to depart from its present reserved
                        position and begin the implementation of a national claims policy. On the
                        other hand, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration might tend to
                        reinforce and give moral support to the US policy of reserving its position
                        on national claims and would leave the US free to explore once again, if it
                        should decide to do so, a policy of internationalization along lines taken
                        in 1948 as perhaps offering the best means of limiting the activities of our
                        more probable enemies in that region and of resolving the conflicting claims
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>In considering our position on this item for the present or 11th <gloss
                            target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> session, it became apparent that some more
                        precise indication as to the future course of US action in the Antarctic
                        region was needed in order to insure that US handling of this question in
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would neither tend to predetermine nor
                        tend to run counter to whatever course of action the US might eventually
                        wish to adopt. As matters presently stand, there is no indication that the
                        US is contemplating the adoption of a policy calling for the announcement of
                        official territorial claims in the Antarctic; on the other hand, the US has
                        neither reaffirmed nor rejected publicly or to the seven friendly power
                        claimants to territory in the Antarctica the position it took in 1948
                        favoring the establishment of an international regime in Antarctica.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1"
                            >Sprague</persName></hi>: In accordance with the arrangement agreed upon
                        at the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> meeting held December 19, 1956,
                        officers of the Department have been reviewing United States position on
                        Antarctic claims and have discussed the matter with officers of Defense.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the question has assumed a degree of urgency. Press and radio
                        reports originating in Australia have publicized the information that the
                        Australian Government is apprehensive about Soviet military activities in
                        the Antarctic and has urged the United States to make a territorial claim
                        and give up its policy of non-recognition of other countries’ claims. The
                        Australian Government is expected to raise this question again in connection
                        with the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Conferences in
                        Canberra.</p>
                    <p>A review of our policy consideration over the past few years shows that this
                        Department has quite consistently been in favor of making a territorial
                        claim or claims and entering into negotiations with other countries
                        concerning their respective claims. In recent years a foremost consideration
                        has been the exclusion from the Antarctic of countries whose interests are
                        likely to be inimical to the United States.</p>
                    <p>In 1948 it was proposed that the Antarctic be placed under <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship. The British Government rightly
                        pointed out that this would give the <gloss target="#t_U.S.S.R.1"
                            >U.S.S.R.</gloss> a voice in controlling it, so instead, the United
                        States proposed a condominium composed of the seven claimant nations—UK,
                        France, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Chile—plus the United
                        States, which would also assert a claim. This suggestion was not received
                        favorably by most of the other interested countries, and since that time we
                        have given consideration to a number of alternative suggestions.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of Antarctica was again
                        proposed in 1956 when India sought to place the question on the agenda of
                        the General Assembly. The United States was opposed to this, partly because
                        it would stand in the way of a settlement of the territorial question among
                        the nations conceded to have paramount interest, and partly because it could
                        well be another wedge whereby the Soviets might gain a voice in the control
                        of the continent.</p>
                    <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0683"/>
                    <p>Fortunately the Indians decided to withdraw their proposal, but they may be
                        expected to reintroduce it at a later date. In anticipation of this, it is
                        felt that the foremost objective of our national policy on Antarctica, “to
                        ensure maintenance of control by the U.S. and friendly powers and exclude
                        our most probable enemies” (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5424/1, Par.
                        6) makes it highly desirable that the United States be in a position to
                        align itself with the other Free World countries that have made Antarctic
                        claims and have been most active there.</p>
                    <p>Although <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5424/1 does not itself provide
                        for making a territorial claim, it leaves the door open for such action at
                        an opportune time, when it is determined that such a course will best serve
                        basic objectives.</p>
                    <p>The Department is now of the opinion that a proposal which merits
                        consideration is that the United States should become a claimant to the
                        Unclaimed Sector of Antarctica between 90° and 150° W. Long. Implicit in
                        this action would be the abandonment of the present policy of not
                        recognizing the claims of other countries although such recognition would
                        not be automatic. In any ensuing negotiations with other claimants the
                        pattern of foreign claims recognition would emerge.</p>
                    <p>It is in our national interest to assure that the territory of the Antarctic
                        is either in the hands of the United States or of other friendly countries.
                        Five-sixths of the continent is already claimed by seven other countries,
                        all friendly to the United States and on which it is felt we could rely for
                        cooperation in almost any undertaking we might have there. It is true that
                        American explorers have discovered and explored certain areas within other
                        countries’ claims also, and that we could probably justify claims to some of
                        them. We have never done so, however, and it is not felt that any present
                        need would be served by so doing, although several countries have indicated
                        that they would be willing to entertain any American suggestions of transfer
                        based on possible conflict of claims.</p>
                    <p>Further delay in asserting claim to the Unclaimed Sector, which is not likely
                        to be challenged by any other Antarctic claimant, will weaken our position
                        and is an open invitation for others to step in and establish “squatters’
                        rights”.</p>
                    <p>As a claimant to a sector of Antarctica the United States would be on equal
                        footing with other claimants in any joint effort to resist encroachment on
                        the part of unfriendly powers anywhere in the Antarctic. As an official
                        claimant, the United States would be in a better position to promote
                        internationalization if this should again be deemed expedient. Furthermore,
                        the possession of a stake as an official claimant in the continent would
                        give us greater bargaining power in any future transfers or redistribution
                        of territory.</p>
                    <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0684"/>
                    <p>It is therefore the Department’s intention to continue to advocate the
                        adoption of an affirmative claims policy by the National Security Council.
                        Inasmuch as the present review was undertaken as a prelude to consideration
                        of the matter by the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Working Group, an

                        activities and the Australian approach, will be appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador McClintock opened the meeting by outlining the actions required by
                        the Secretary’s request for an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> review of
                        the United States Antarctic policy, and asked Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WLD1">Watrous</persName> to comment on events leading up to
                        State’s letter of March 11 to Defense. The Ambassador then asked if Defense
                        had arrived at a position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ernst replied in the negative, adding that because of the forthcoming
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board Meeting, Defense had
                        felt that the question should be referred to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He
                        said that several considerations had to be taken into account, such as the
                        strategic importance of the Drake Passage, the presence or absence of
                        minerals, and post-<gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> activity. In response
                        to Ambassador McClintock’s question about expenses in connection with any
                        U.S. claim, Mr. Ernst indicated that Defense, because of a tighter budget
                        and the low priority accorded the Antarctic vis-à-vis combatant forces,
                        would be reluctant to defray much of the cost.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ernst also said that Defense is interested in being able to move freely
                        about Antarctica, and is wondering what effect a U.S. claim would have on
                        other claims; should this result in the creation of walls around the several
                        claims, he said, our making a claim would be contra-productive. In this
                        light, he felt that some form of <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0686"
                        />pooling, or condominium, might be explored, possibly on Australian
                        initiative. The Indian proposal in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was
                        also touched on briefly.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question about the validity of claims, Miss Whiteman stated
                        that to have a better claim a nation must have done more than other nations,
                        and that no two claims were really equal.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador McClintock gave his opinion that we were actually faced with a
                        diplomatic problem: to get the Russians out of Antarctica. He wondered
                        whether a claim on our part would accomplish this.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representative said that in his
                        judgement it was doubtful, and that it appeared that the Soviets were moving
                        in the direction of remaining. He then reviewed the USSR’s recent position
                        on Antarctica, with emphasis on its scientific and economic interests.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador McClintock then suggested, and it was agreed, that during the week
                        ending March 29 papers should be drawn up on several aspects of the problem,
                        and that after these had been exchanged and considered, another meeting
                        should be held on April 2, at 3 p.m. In brief, papers were to be prepared as

                    <p>Mr. McClintock apologized for postponing the meeting one day. He said the
                        matter was not quite so urgent since we had been given until April 12
                        (instead of April 5) to present the inter-agency recommendations to the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>He said the papers presented by all agencies<note n="2" xml:id="d323fn2">None
                            found.</note> except Defense were satisfactory, and asked Mr. Ernst when
                        Defense could be expected to make up its mind. Mr. Ernst said the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff had not yet made up its mind. They are discussing the answer
                        to the Department’s March 11 letter,<note n="3" xml:id="d323fn3"><ref
                                target="#d320">Document 320</ref>.</note> he said, but there is as
                        yet no agreement on how the answer is to be. But they are giving it high
                        priority and hope to reach a firm decision in the near future. He said he
                        could anticipate that Defense might have some reservations about limiting
                        the US claim (if any) to the Unclaimed Sector, as they are more interested
                        in other parts of Antarctica.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bane said he was sure a US claim would precipitate <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> action and we should be prepared for this if we decide to go
                        ahead with a claim. He said this did not mean <gloss target="#t_IO1"
                            >IO</gloss> is opposed to making a claim, and added that it would be
                        much better to act quickly if we are going to make a claim than to let the
                        thing drag on until the Antarctic issue is again raised in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Miss Whiteman said <gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss> is in favor of making a
                        claim and has been for many years, but that off the record she wished to
                        point out that she thinks the one sure way to precipitate a Soviet claim is
                        to make one of our own, and therefore we should be prepared for this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Crowley said we could anticipate the Russians would either make a claim
                        or go to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to protest against all claims
                        and appeal for internationalization, but that they would not do both. In
                        other words, if the Russians are going to make a claim, they would lose
                        India’s support.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representatives expressed the opinion
                        that we are building trouble for ourselves by upsetting the apple cart and
                        that the benefits to be gained by pleasing the Australians would not be
                        worth the antagonizing of the Russians. Ambassador McClintock said we are
                        already in trouble anyway.</p>
                    <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0688"/>
                    <p>In closing the meeting, Ambassador McClintock said he believed the most the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> could be expected to decide at this
                        time is to initiate conversations with our Allies (i.e. the seven present
                        claimants) preparatory to making a claim. He said he felt that we should
                        agree to tell the other friendly countries that we are going to make a claim
                        but haven’t decided exactly what and would like to discuss it with them.
                        This would also be the opportunity for safeguarding our rights to utilize
                        all Antarctic territory. The Ambassador said he personally is opposed to a
                        condominium, since condominiums never work, and that it would be much better
                        just to cut up the pie and divide it among the US and present claimants. If
                        the other countries prefer a trusteeship, then we could consider that, and
                        he said that he could imagine many worse solutions than a trusteeship on
                        which Russia would be represented, if it eventually should come to that.</p>
                    <p>After the meeting, Ambassador McClintock expressed to me the view that since
                        this is clearly a diplomatic problem …<note n="4" xml:id="d323fn4">Ellipses
                            in this paragraph are in the source text.</note> not a military or
                        intelligence one … State’s recommendations will carry more weight than that
                        of other agencies with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, and
                        therefore he anticipates that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> will agree
                        to making a claim. In his view, there is no turning back now on State’s
                        policy, since it has been formally expressed in the March 11 letter to
                        Defense.</p>

                        concerning Antarctic claims. The Department of Defense has given your
                        proposal careful study and we recognize that some form of international
                        control may be useful. We are also in substantial agreement that the
                        assertion of a claim by the United States is now timely. It is our belief,
                        however, that there are valid reasons for considering assertion of a claim
                        broader than that outlined in your letter.</p>

                    <p>Since this question was considered by the Planning Board on April 12 and will
                        be before the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on 2 May, I would suggest
                        that the resolution of our respective departmental views be left for that
                        machinery. This will provide an opportunity for all agencies including our
                        two Departments to be directly represented in further consideration of this

                        buying a pig in a poke. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>
                        also had some reservations about our making claims at this time, while the
                        representative of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> favored a policy
                        of claiming now.</p>
                    <p>There was also an inconclusive discussion of the possibility of taking the
                        Antarctic to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> said that he would draw
                        up an interim report for submission to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss>; copies of his draft are to be sent to the interested
                        agencies.</p>
                    <p>Following the Secretary’s meeting on April 23, Mr. Rubottom asked Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> about the meeting described
                        above. The latter said that he had been impressed by the advocates of not
                        making claims at this time, and that he was not convinced that making claims
                        would achieve our policy objectives. Mr. Rubottom raised the point that if
                        we continued to delay claiming we might end up with nothing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> explained that General
                            <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName>’s draft would be sent to
                        him, and that <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> would receive a copy for
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>[When this copy is received I shall see that the interested areas of State

                        <item>In accordance with the President’s directive of March 20, 1957, based
                            on a recommendation from the Secretary of State, the Planning Board has
                            been engaged in a review of U.S. policy on Antarctica. Admiral Dufek,
                            who has been in charge of U.S. Antarctica expeditions, and
                            representatives of Interior and the National Science Foundation have
                            participated in Planning Board discussions. Because the Planning Board
                            is not yet prepared to recommend a revision of existing Antarctica
                            policy, I submit this interim report.</item>

                        <item>The existing U.S. policy on Antarctica, adopted in July, 1954,
                            provided that the United States would not make a formal claim to any
                            Antarctica territory, but would reserve and at an appropriate later time
                            reassert all its rights therein. At that time, and in subsequent
                            reconsideration of the policy by the National Security Council in 1956,
                            the major emphasis of U.S. programs in Antarctica was placed upon
                            scientific activities in support of the International Geophysical

                                <item>A known value to the world is the scientific information as to

                                    International Geophysical Year. Such information may improve
                                    future long-range weather forecasting and contribute more
                                    precise knowledge as to the earth’s atmosphere. There has been
                                    excellent cooperation among the different countries, including
                                    the Soviet Union, participating in these scientific activities
                                    in Antarctica. It is possible, although not certain, that the
                                    assertion by the United States of a formal claim in Antarctica
                                    might cause lessened Soviet cooperation during the International

                                    United States in asserting a formal claim to any particular
                                    area. However, the existing unclaimed area of Antarctica appears
                                    to be of less value than other areas which are already claimed
                                    by other friendly Free World nations but in which the United
                                    States also has inchoate rights.</item>

                                <item>The assertion by the United States of a formal claim might
                                    legally improve the Free World position in Antarctica by
                                    completing Free World claims to the entire Antarctic continent.
                                    However, such an assertion might stimulate the assertion of
                                    Soviet claims and an extension of Soviet propaganda. In any
                                    case, the assertion of a U.S. claim will not prevent, and at
                                    best will only render more difficult, the acquisition and
                                    strengthening by the Soviet Union of legal claims to any part of
                                    Antarctica. In the final analysis, the Soviets can be denied
                                    access to the Antarctic continent only by force.</item>

                            claimed by the three powers. At the same time, the United States would
                            assert formal claims, or reserve its rights to assert formal claims, in

                        <p rend="center">Comments by the Director, National Science Foundation</p>
                        <p>From the standpoint of basic research in science, the special interest in
                            Antarctica lies generally in the field of the geophysical sciences; and
                            these are now largely covered in the International Geophysical Year
                            program. The area is unique, of course, in its location and size and,
                            scientifically, because a polar region with the possibility of stable
                            observation stations provides opportunities for scientific observations
                            on phenomena which are intensified or confined to the region. For
                            example, radio interference has its maximum intensity in the polar
                            regions where the causes of the interference seem to be most pronounced.
                            Also, there is evidence that the enormous mass of cold air over this
                            large continent is a breeding ground for storms. Until we know the
                            results of the basic research being carried out during the International
                            Geophysical Year, one can hardly forecast what special fields will turn
                            out to be of great importance. However, it is reasonably certain that
                            considerable progress in improvement of weather forecasting, even in the
                            Northern Hemisphere, will depend upon meteorological observations in
                            Antarctica. Also, better understanding of the causes of radio noise
                            (static) and radio communication blackout and of how to avoid them is
                            practically certain.</p>
                        <p>The essential point is that at present, continuing observations in this
                            area would be in the national interest from the standpoint of science,
                            defense, and general welfare. In order to place basic research in proper
                            perspective with respect to other scientific and non-scientific U.S.
                            interests, it may be stated that after the International Geophysical
                            Year, the value of basic research <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> would not
                            at present appear to justify the logistic costs. However, the value of
                            mission-related research, observation, and scientific or technical
                            activity is determined by specific ends to be achieved. In the case of
                            weather forecasting and improved communications, this value is
                            undoubtedly high; other activities such as economic resource evaluation
                            may also be determined to be important. Finally, we assume there are
                            national interests in maintaining U.S. activity based on considerations
                            which are entirely unrelated to science.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. should certainly not wish to be denied the right to conduct
                            observations in the Antarctica, especially in the fields of meteorology
                            and radio communication. Because of the effort and expense involved, the
                            best way to secure the desired information would be by setting up a
                            network of observing stations in cooperation <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669"
                                facs="0695"/>with other nations. With the establishment of such a
                            network of stations corresponding approximately to the current
                            International Geophysical Year network but not necessarily so extensive,
                            it would be possible at minimum cost to conduct further scientific
                            research, both basic and applied, and provide bases for other technical
                            activities of an operational nature, to the extent deemed desirable to
                            further the missions of various government agencies and to further broad
                            U.S. aims.</p>

                            <item>There is very little known about the Antarctica area from a
                                biological point of view. Evidences of large quantities of fish,
                                whales, bird life, and plankton indicate that there may be rich
                                resources of marine and aquatic life concerning which the United
                                States should be better informed. It would be desirable in the
                                public interest to explore the area and develop a greater knowledge
                                of conditions affecting biological life in the region. It is
                                possible that certain conditions in the area exert substantial
                                influences on the movement of fish throughout the world and are
                                therefore of concern to the U.S. fishing industry.</item>

                                South American Continent. It is possible that Antarctica may contain
                                some minerals which would be useful to the United States, but to
                                date no work at all has been done on the geology of the area. It is
                                desirable to reduce to topographic maps the information gathered to
                                date and formulate a program to explore the geology of the

                        “Interim Report on Antarctica”, dated April 26, 1957)</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> briefed the Council on the
                        contents of the Planning Board’s Interim Report on Antarctica, in the course
                        of which he referred to a map of the Antarctic Continent which indicated the
                        claims of the various nations to portions of Antarctica. In the course of
                        explaining why the Planning Board had thus far been unable to present the
                        Council with a revised policy statement on Antarctica, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> read verbatim paragraphs 4, 5 and 7
                        of the Interim Report. In sum, the Planning Board did not feel that it had
                        sufficient sound information as to the economic and strategic importance of
                        Antarctica to the United States. Furthermore, the Planning Board had been
                        unable to make up its mind as to the wisdom of changing our current policy,
                        which calls for the reservation of all U.S. rights in Antarctica, to a new
                        policy which would call for the assertion by the United States of formal
                        claims to portions of the Antarctic Continent. In conclusion, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> said that the Planning Board would

                    <p>As a result of two meetings held on the Antarctic, it was agreed that the
                        State Department should propose to the National Security Council that a
                        determination of U.S. policy in favor of the U.S. <pb n="674"
                            xml:id="pg_674" facs="0700"/>making a claim in the Antarctic be
                        approved. The matter of extent of the claim (i.e., whether only to the
                        unclaimed area between 90° and 150° W. Long., or, whether in addition, to
                        other areas as desired by the Defense Department under its present policy),
                        was also discussed though this question was not considered pertinent to the
                        problem immediately at hand. It was generally felt that, if a claim were
                        made, a more extensive claim would be preferable to a less extensive, and
                        that agreement regarding the disputed area could then be made by negotiation
                        with the other powers concerned.</p>
                    <p>The group favored the traditional type of unilateral claim, and in
                        conjunction therewith, recognition subject to negotiation by the U.S. of
                        claims already made by the other powers. The possibility was recognized,
                        however, that if the U.S. made a claim the entire matter might be thrown
                        into the United Nations. That the Russians might also make a claim, either
                        before or after U.S. action, was also considered possible. In the event that
                        the question of claims in the Antarctic were taken up by the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the logical solution seemed to be the
                        establishment of a trusteeship to be administered by the states directly
                        concerned, or as a last resort, a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        trusteeship to be administered by an official of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> itself. Another possibility was that of a condominium
                        involving joint sovereignty and control, by the claimant powers, with
                        appropriate relationship with the United Nations. A condominium was
                        considered preferable to the trusteeships although in either case the
                        opposition of Chile and Argentina could be expected. Probable opposition of
                        Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand on the trusteeship arrangement also
                        might be expected.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the Russians would probably not, under any circumstances,
                        leave the Antarctic, nor would any claim or establishment of a sovereign
                        administration over the area cause them to leave. … It was agreed then that
                        a determination of policy in favor, in principle, of the U.S. making a claim
                        in Antarctica should be recommended and that the matter of timing would be
                        left to future considerations. A possible date of January 1, 1959, the end
                        of the International Geophysical Year, was suggested.</p>
                    <p>If a determination of policy in favor of making a claim is approved, it was
                        agreed immediate diplomatic discussions with the other claimant powers
                        should be undertaken to develop agreed positions as to timing of the U.S.
                        claim and form of administration of the area.</p>

                            <item>Antarctica, comprising a vast continent and nearby islands, is not
                                readily accessible even during the brief Antarctic “summer”, and
                                much of it has never been seen or explored. It has little or no
                                present economic value. However, it has considerable immediate
                                importance for scientific purposes; our understanding of the
                                physical structure of the world and its atmosphere will be
                                materially advanced <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0702"/>by data
                                obtainable only in Antarctica. Moreover, Antarctica may have other
                                potential values not now determinable, so that its importance could
                                conceivably increase greatly with additional knowledge and new
                                technical developments.</item>

                            <item>The existing U.S. policy on Antarctica, adopted in July, 1954 and
                                amended in January, 1956, provided that the United States would not
                                make a formal claim to any Antarctic territory, but would reserve
                                and at an appropriate later time reassert all its rights therein. At
                                that time, and in subsequent reconsideration of the policy by the
                                National Security Council in 1956, the major emphasis of U.S.
                                programs in Antarctica was placed upon scientific activities in
                                support of the International Geophysical Year.</item>

                            <item>While Antarctica’s strategic significance appears to be remote,
                                the arrival in the area of Soviet scientific expeditions in
                                connection with the International Geophysical Year has aroused
                                concern among our Antipodean Allies, Australia and New Zealand, as
                                well as the United Kingdom, as to possible future Russian activities
                                in that area… . Soviet expeditionary parties have already
                                established scientific stations and semi-permanent installations in
                                the area presently claimed by Australia, and there is evidence that
                                they intend to remain in Antarctica after the International
                                Geophysical Year.</item>

                            <item>The seven countries which thus far have made formal claims to
                                territory in the Antarctic region are the United Kingdom, New
                                Zealand, Australia, Norway, France, Argentina and Chile. There are
                                two extensive unclaimed sectors: One extending between 90° and 150°
                                west longitude, and the other poleward of the Norwegian claim
                                between 45° east and 20° west longitude. The United States has
                                important potential claims based on discovery and scientific
                                activity within the other national claims, and in the unclaimed
                                sectors. The Soviet Union has not yet announced its tenuous claim,
                                based on a single sighting expedition under Von Bellingshausen in
                                1819-21. However, extensive Soviet activity in the area during the
                                past two years provides a basis for Soviet claims which the Western
                                powers might find legally difficult to refute. Since World War II,
                                the USSR has taken part in pelagic whaling in the area. Neither the
                                United States nor the USSR has recognized the claims of other
                                powers, or made claims of its own. However, the United States has
                                reserved all its “rights” in the area, and the USSR has asserted the
                                right to participate in any territorial settlement.</item>

                            <item>In 1948, the United States explored unsuccessfully with the
                                claimant powers the possibility of placing the Antarctic under some
                                form of international administration. The United States has neither
                                reaffirmed nor rejected, publicly or to the present claimant powers,
                                the position it took publicly in 1948 favoring the establishment of
                                an international regime in Antarctica. Conversations with the other
                                    <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0703"/>friendly governments
                                who have advanced claims to portions of Antarctica have produced no
                                agreement. Argentina and Chile take a pronounced nationalistic and
                                emotional attitude toward their prospective and sometimes
                                conflicting claims, which cover the Drake Straits and the Palmer
                                Peninsula, and from a purely strategic point of view constitute most
                                important areas in Antarctica. Argentina and Chile contest the
                                claims of the United Kingdom to the same area, and their quarrel
                                with Great Britain is exacerbated by Argentine sensitivity over the
                                Falkland Islands dispute. However, there is reason to believe that
                                both Argentina and Chile would resist Soviet claims to areas in the
                                Antarctic. In summary, there is no present agreement among the
                                claimant powers on any type of international administration of
                                Antarctica.</item>

                            <item>At the last session of the United Nations General Assembly, the
                                Indian Delegation sought to have the question of Antarctica placed
                                on the agenda, but later withdrew its proposal. It is possible that
                                the Indians will again raise the issue at the next General Assembly.
                                Apparently, the Indian Government believes that the Antarctic will
                                become a ground of further international contention and thus
                                contribute to a continuation of the cold war. In the event that a
                                trusteeship should be proposed, it does not seem probable that the
                                presence of the USSR as a member of the Trusteeship Council as
                                presently constituted would cause insurmountable difficulty in the
                                immediate future. However, the presence of the Soviet Union as one
                                of the trust powers would be unacceptable.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>…In this connection, Australia has suggested that the United
                                States might assert a claim to Antarctic territory. Such a U.S.
                                claim would not necessarily induce Soviet withdrawal, and might even
                                have the opposite effect of stimulating a Soviet claim. A U.S.
                                claim, however, would improve the legal position of the United
                                States in opposing any Soviet claims which might be made in
                                supporting Australia in any efforts to induce the Soviets to
                                withdraw, and in participating in joint action with other Free World
                                claimants. Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom seem to
                                feel that the United States should claim the sector between 90° and
                                150° west longitude, and they would not be averse to the formal
                                expression of wider claims by the United States.</item>

                            <item>…it would seem desirable, on balance, that the United States,
                                irrespective of the Soviet position, make a formal claim to portions

                            <item>The immediate question is not whether to assert a claim but when.
                                It is generally agreed in the scientific and intelligence community
                                that the present highly satisfactory cooperation among the countries
                                participating in the <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> in the
                                Antarctic, including the Soviet Union, might be jeopardized by the
                                precipitate utterance of a U.S. claim to territory in the Antarctic.
                                In consequence, unless the USSR in the meantime puts forward a
                                claim, it is recommended that the United States refrain from
                                announcing a claim in Antarctica until the close of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> in December, 1958. The tentative
                                target date, therefore, for the putting forth of a U.S. claim is

                                appears imminent, the United States should be prepared immediately

                                    <item>The United States could put forward claim to the unclaimed

                                        longitude) and reserve its rights to other areas based on
                                        U.S. discovery, U.S. scientific exploration, or other U.S.
                                        activity. This would have the effect of completing a 360°
                                        circle around Antarctica, with the result that the entire
                                        continent and its adjacent islands would have been formally
                                        claimed by the United States and the other seven Free World

                                        subject to negotiation with the other claimant powers, of
                                        the Antarctica claims of the seven Free World countries

                                        the United States might, with respect to those areas in

                                    <item>The United States could, in setting forth its formal claim
                                        to areas in Antarctica, simultaneously declare its readiness
                                        to merge its claims with those of the other Free World
                                        powers in a condominium with a suitable relationship to the
                                        United Nations. In the absence of an effective Soviet claim,
                                        such an international administration of Antarctica would
                                        thus ensure its retention in Free World hands and would
                                        obviate the necessity of negotiating out rival claims as
                                        between the eight Free World powers. However, there is
                                        reason to believe that both Argentina and Chile would
                                        strenuously resist the concept of a condominium. The nature

                                        powers in a United Nations trusteeship. It is probable,

                                        claim in Antarctica, that sufficient voting strength could
                                        be mustered in the United Nations to prevent any Soviet
                                        pretension to be considered as “a state directly concerned”
                                        in a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship and to

                                        Conversely, the USSR might be able to prevent General
                                        Assembly approval of a trusteeship which excluded the USSR.

                                before or on January 1, 1959, the principle of resupply requires
                                that this year’s expedition—Deep Freeze III— should carry with it
                                emergency supplies for any station that will remain active after

                                        right (presumably but not necessarily limited to the
                                        unclaimed areas), to place it on an equal footing with the
                                        seven powers. Thereupon the U.S. and the seven powers would
                                        merge and join their claims to and interests in the area in
                                        a special regime dedicated to administering and developing
                                        the area as a unit, not as individual segments. As matters
                                        stand now, the U.S. is reluctant to lay claim to areas in
                                        the Antarctic until it is in a position to ascertain more
                                        precisely all the areas to which it might wish to lay claim.
                                        By seeking a condominium agreement, the U.S. and the seven
                                        powers could move before Antarctica becomes a subject for
                                        continuing discussion in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                                        a U.S. territorial claim would occur approximately
                                        simultaneously with the announcement of the conclusion of a

                            <item><p>While the trusteeship system was established primarily for the
                                    development of peoples, there is nothing in the Charter
                                    excluding the application of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                    trusteeship to uninhabited areas. It could be justified by the
                                    first of the four basic objectives of the system as stated under
                                    Article 76, viz., “to further international peace and security”.
                                    (This has particular interest now since India’s current interest
                                    in obtaining <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> consideration of
                                    Antarctica derives in large part from India’s concern that
                                    Antarctica might become a possible area of East-West tension as
                                    well as a possible nuclear testing site.) Under Article 77(c) of
                                    the Charter the trusteeship system may be applied to territories
                                    voluntarily placed under the system by states responsible for
                                    their administration. (Those countries having made official
                                    claim to territory in the Antarctic consider themselves
                                    sovereign within the areas of their claims and hence could be
                                    expected to consider themselves as states responsible for
                                    administration within the meaning of Article 77.) The Charter
                                    also provides that territories held under mandate as well as
                                    territories detached from enemy states as a result of the Second
                                    World War may be placed under the trusteeship system; however,
                                    these are not possibilities in the case of Antarctica.</p>
                                <p>Under Article 79 of the Charter, the terms of trusteeship shall
                                    be agreed upon by the states directly concerned. (The exact
                                    criteria for determining a “state directly concerned” have not
                                    been agreed upon in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.)
                                    Article 81 provides that the trusteeship agreement shall include
                                    the terms under which the trust territory will be administered
                                    and designate the authority which will exercise the
                                    administration of the trust territory. Such authority may be one
                                    or more states or the Organization itself. (In the latter case,
                                    the Organization would designate an administering agent.) Thus
                                    the terms of trusteeship agreed upon between the U.S. and the
                                    seven claimant powers could provide for the designation of one
                                    or more of their <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0710"/>number
                                    as the administering authority, or the United Nations
                                    Organization itself as the administering authority. Moreover,
                                    the seven powers and the U.S. could agree to designate part or
                                    all of the Antarctic region as a strategic area; however, all
                                    functions of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> relating to
                                    strategic areas, including the approval of the terms of the
                                    trusteeship agreement, are exercised by the Security Council and
                                    would be subject, therefore, to the Soviet veto (Article 83).
                                    Additionally, designation of the Antarctic as a strategic area
                                    would likely be interpreted by some nations as being in conflict
                                    with the objective of peaceful utilization of Antarctica. On the
                                    other hand, the functions of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                        >UN</gloss> with regard to trusteeship agreements for areas

                                    of trusteeship agreements, are exercised by the General
                                    Assembly. The question of the approval of a proposed trusteeship
                                    agreement by the General Assembly requires a two-thirds vote.
                                    The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, however, could not impose
                                    a trusteeship on a part or all of Antarctica in the absence of

                                        it would also eliminate by the same token the present

                    <p>A meeting in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s office was
                        called at Mr. Snow’s request preparatory to the meeting of the Planning
                        Board of the National Security Council on June 3. The purpose of the meeting
                        was to assure that the Department of State was in agreement with the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board’s draft statement of policy
                        providing for the making of claims in the Antarctic. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated that it was the
                        Secretary’s desire that the United States policy in regard to the Antarctic
                        be reviewed and that provision be made for making claims at an appropriate
                        time in the Antarctic. This appeared to be the general consensus of the
                        group although Mr. Mayer indicated that in the case of <gloss
                            target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> a Bureau level policy had not been
                        established. This he said would be done at an early date. In discussing the
                        method of control over the area, Mr. Mayer, <gloss target="#t_EUR1"

                            as to Mayer’s identity. He is listed with the Office of the Legal
                            Adviser in the list of participants and with the Bureau of European
                            Affairs in the text. Presumably the reference is to Ernest de Wael

                            >Meeker</persName>,<gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>, expressed opposition
                        to the paragraph in the draft <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> statement
                        of policy regarding possible establishment of the trusteeship. This
                        paragraph, basically drafted in <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>, stated,
                        in effect, that a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship arrangement
                        over the Antarctic would not provide adequate protection for U.S. and free
                        world interests. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MLC1">Meeker</persName> and
                        Mayer were of the opinion a trusteeship might be the most feasible method of
                        solving the territorial or other problems relating to Antarctica.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> in closing stated that the
                        primary consideration was that the National Security Council should go
                        forward to establish a policy providing for the making of claims in the
                        Antarctic. <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0717"/>The other matters were
                        not of immediate concern and would have to be worked out in the best
                        possible manner.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> briefed the National
                        Security Council very thoroughly on the high points in the draft statement
                        of policy on the subject, and called attention to the map of Antarctica
                        which had been distributed at the beginning of the meeting. (Copies of Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName>’s briefing note and the
                        Antarctica map are filed in the minutes of the meeting.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d332fn4">Not further identified.</note>) At the conclusion of
                        his briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> called on
                        the Secretary of State to speak.</p>
                    <p>On this subject, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                        insisted that he could see no necessity for spending any money that we don’t
                        want to spend in the future to carry on scientific work in the Antarctic.
                        The point was that we already have a sufficiently good basis for U.S. claims
                        in the Antarctic. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> also
                        pointed out that the Planning Board had contemplated the reduction of U.S.
                        bases in the Antarctic at the end of the International Geophysical Year. The
                        President expressed the view that the United States would probably not need
                        any permanent stations in Antarctica after the termination of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> on December 31, 1958. Certainly, as the
                        Secretary of State had said, we wouldn’t <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692"
                            facs="0718"/>need very much in the way of permanent stations. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, however, complained of
                        the expenses that this policy would involve for the Defense Department,
                        particularly in the light of the tight budgetary situation we were now
                        facing. Mr. Brundage expressed the view that it was a very bad time for the
                        United States to stake out claims in Antarctica. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> then quoted paragraph 19 of <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5715, to the effect that the United States
                        was not to announce any claims until <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss>
                        considerations were no longer a major factor. At that time, after <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> review, the United States would announce
                        the total definitive U.S. claim.</p>

                            <item>Antarctica, comprising a vast continent and nearby islands, is not
                                readily accessible even during the brief Antarctic “summer”, and
                                much of it has never been seen or explored. It has no present
                                economic value. However, it has considerable importance for
                                scientific purposes; our understanding of the physical structure of
                                the world and its atmosphere will be materially advanced by data
                                obtainable only in Antarctica. Moreover, Antarctica may have other
                                potential values not now determinable, so that its importance could
                                conceivably increase greatly with additional knowledge and new
                                technical developments.</item>

                            <item>The existing U.S. policy on Antarctica (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                    >NSC</gloss> 5424/1), adopted in July, 1954 and amended in
                                January, 1956 (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1500),
                                provided that the United States would not make a formal claim to any
                                Antarctic territory, but would reserve and at an appropriate later
                                time reassert its rights therein. At that time, and in subsequent
                                reconsideration of the policy by the National Security Council in
                                1956, the major emphasis of U.S. programs in Antarctica was placed
                                upon scientific activities in support of the International
                                Geophysical Year (<gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss>).</item>

                            <item>While Antarctica’s strategic significance appears to be limited,
                                the arrival in the area of Soviet scientific expeditions in
                                connection with the <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> has aroused
                                concern among our antipodean allies, Australia and New Zealand, as
                                well as the United Kingdom, as to possible future Russian activities
                                in that area.… Soviet expeditionary parties have already established
                                scientific stations and semi-permanent installations in the area
                                presently claimed by Australia, and there is evidence that they
                                intend to remain in Antarctica after the International Geophysical
                                Year. In addition, prominent in the <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695"

                                biology, which were not a part of U.S. activities during the past
                                season.</item>

                            <item>The seven countries which thus far have made formal claims to
                                territory in the Antarctic region are the United Kingdom, New
                                Zealand, Australia, Norway, France, Argentina and Chile. There are
                                two extensive unclaimed sectors: one extending between 90° and 150°
                                west longitude, and the other poleward of the Norwegian claim
                                between 45° east and 20° west longitude. The United States has
                                important potential claims based on discovery and on scientific and
                                other activity, both within the other national claims and in the
                                unclaimed sectors. The Soviet Union has not yet announced a claim,
                                which might rest on the tenuous historical basis of a single
                                sighting expedition under Von Bellingshausen in 1819–21. However,
                                extensive Soviet activity in the area at the present time could
                                provide a possible basis for Soviet claims which the Western powers
                                might find difficult to refute. In addition, the USSR has since
                                World War II taken part in pelagic whaling in the area. Neither the
                                United States nor the USSR has recognized the claims of other
                                powers, or made claims of its own. However, the United States, on
                                numerous occasions in diplomatic notes, and publicly, has expressed
                                its policy of reserving all its rights in the area, and the USSR has
                                officially asserted the right to participate in any territorial
                                    settlement.<note n="5" xml:id="d333fn5">By a Soviet Memorandum

                            <item>In 1948, the United States explored unsuccessfully with the
                                claimant powers the possibility of announcing a U.S. claim and
                                placing the Antarctic under some form of international
                                administration. The United States has neither reaffirmed nor
                                rejected, publicly or to the present claimant powers, the position
                                it took publicly in 1948 favoring the establishment of an
                                international regime in Antarctica. U.S. policy as a matter of fact
                                did not call for further discussions with the other claimant powers
                                regarding the possibility of internationalization of Antarctica.
                                There is some indication, however, that the United Kingdom and
                                Australia have not entirely ruled out internationalization as a
                                possible solution to the Antarctic claims problem. Argentina and

                                Chile contest the claims of the United Kingdom to the area, and
                                their quarrel with Great Britain is exacerbated by the Argentine-UK
                                dispute over the Falkland Islands.</item>

                            <item><p>At the last session of the United Nations General Assembly, the
                                    Indian Delegation sought to have the question of Antarctica
                                    placed on the agenda but later withdrew its proposal. It is
                                    possible that the Indians will again raise the issue at the next

                                    that the Antarctic may become a ground of further international
                                    contention and thus contribute to a continuation of the cold
                                    war. In the event that the issue is raised in the General
                                    Assembly, it is possible that a trusteeship arrangement might be
                                    proposed as a means of resolving the Antarctic claims problem.
                                    The United Nations, however, could not impose a trusteeship on a
                                    part or all of Antarctica in the absence of the agreement of the
                                    states directly concerned. If a trusteeship were to be accepted
                                    and applied, it does not seem likely that the presence of the
                                    USSR as a member of the Trusteeship Council would cause
                                    insurmountable difficulty in the immediate future for the United
                                    States and the friendly claimant powers. However, the presence
                                    of the Soviet Union as one of the trust powers would be
                                    unacceptable.</p>

                                the Pacific, such as the Bonins, are administered by the Navy. The

                                    <item>The conclusion of a joint administration would resolve the
                                        conflicting claims issue as between the seven claimant
                                        powers and would eliminate the necessity of the United
                                        States having to decide now upon the entirety of the area to
                                        which it might wish to lay claim in the Antarctic. As was
                                        contemplated in 1948, the United States, under such an
                                        arrangement, would lay claim to areas in the Antarctic to
                                        which it had right (presumably but not necessarily limited
                                        to the unclaimed areas), to place it on an equal footing
                                        with the seven powers. Thereupon the United States and the
                                        seven powers would merge and join their claims to and
                                        interests in the area in a special regime dedicated to
                                        administering and developing the area as a unit, not as
                                        individual segments. As matters stand now, the United States
                                        is reluctant to lay claim to areas in the Antarctic until it
                                        is in a position to ascertain more precisely all the areas
                                        to which it might wish to lay claim. By seeking a
                                        condominium agreement, the United States and the seven
                                        powers could move before Antarctica becomes a subject for
                                        continuing discussion in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                                    development of peoples, there is nothing in the Charter
                                    excluding the application of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                    trusteeship to uninhabited areas. It could be justified by the
                                    first of the four basic objectives of the system as stated under
                                    Article 76, viz., “to further international peace and security”.
                                    (This has particular interest now since India’s current interest
                                    in obtaining <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> consideration of
                                    Antarctica derives in large part from India’s concern that
                                    Antarctica might become a possible area of East-West tension as
                                    well as a possible nuclear testing site.) Under Article 77 (c)
                                    of the Charter the trusteeship system may be applied to
                                    territories voluntarily placed under the system by states
                                    responsible for their administration. (Those countries having
                                    made official claim to territory in the Antarctic consider
                                    themselves sovereign within the areas of their claims and hence
                                    could be expected to consider themselves as states responsible
                                    for administration within the meaning of Article 77.) The
                                    Charter also provides that territories held under mandate as
                                    well as territories detached from enemy states as a result of
                                    the Second World War may be placed under the trusteeship system;
                                    however, these are not possibilities in the case of
                                    Antarctica.</p>
                                <p>Under Article 79 of the Charter, the terms of trusteeship shall
                                    be agreed upon by the states directly concerned. (The exact
                                    criteria for determining a “state directly concerned” have not
                                    been agreed upon in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.)
                                    Article 81 provides that the trusteeship agreement shall include
                                    the terms under which the trust territory will be administered
                                    and designate the authority which will exercise the
                                    administration of the trust territory. Such authority may be one
                                    or more states or the Organization itself. (In the latter case,
                                    the Organization would designate an administering agent.) Thus
                                    the terms of trusteeship agreed upon between the United States
                                    and the seven claimant powers could provide for the designation
                                    of one or more of <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0731"/>their
                                    number as the administering authority, or the United Nations
                                    Organization itself as the administering authority. Moreover,
                                    the seven powers and the United States could agree to designate
                                    part or all of the Antarctic region as a strategic area;
                                    however, all functions of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                    relating to strategic areas, including the approval of the terms
                                    of the trusteeship agreement, are exercised by the Security
                                    Council and would be subject, therefore, to the Soviet veto
                                    (Article 83). Additionally, designation of the Antarctic as a
                                    strategic area would likely be interpreted by some nations as
                                    being in conflict with the objective of peaceful utilization of
                                    Antarctica. On the other hand, the functions of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> with regard to trusteeship
                                    agreements for areas not designated as strategic, including the
                                    approval of the terms of trusteeship agreements, are exercised
                                    by the General Assembly. The question of the approval of a
                                    proposed trusteeship agreement by the General Assembly requires
                                    a two-thirds vote. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                                    however, could not impose a trusteeship on a part or all of
                                    Antarctica in the absence of the agreement of the state or
                                    states directly concerned.</p>
                                <p>All of the foregoing considerations would apply equally if one or
                                    more of the claimant powers were to seek individually rather

                                        >UN</gloss> trusteeship to an area or areas of Antarctica.
                                    It is doubted, however, whether any of the claimant powers would
                                    be prepared to seek the application of a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                        >UN</gloss> trusteeship to a part of the Antarctic region in

                                    trusteeship over Antarctica. The United States proposed to the
                                    UK, Chile and Argentina for consideration the possible
                                    establishment of a voluntary joint or collective non-strategic
                                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship for
                                    Antarctica, the terms of which were to be agreed on by the
                                    United States and the seven claimant powers before submission to
                                    the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss><gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                        >GA</gloss> for approval. The trusteeship was to be a joint
                                    trusteeship administered by the foregoing powers who were to
                                    merge and join their respective claims to and interests in the
                                    area in a special regime. To place itself on an equal juridical
                                    footing with the other powers, the United States contemplated
                                    making at an appropriate time an official claim to areas in
                                    Antarctica to which it had the best rights. The proposed
                                    trusteeship agreement also contemplated free access to, and
                                    freedom of transit through or over, the area of Antarctica under
                                    such rules as the special regime established by the
                                    administering authorities might prescribe. Additionally, the
                                    administering authorities were to take all necessary measures in
                                    the trust territory, within the terms of Article 84 of the
                                    Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and

                                    was not well received in either Argentina or Chile, the United

                                    seven claimant powers in early August, 1948, a draft agreement
                                    proposing an international administration (condominium) for the
                                    Antarctic whereby the parties would merge and join their claims
                                    to and interests in the area in a special regime which would
                                    cooperate with appropriate organs and specialized agencies of
                                    the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Only the UK and New
                                    Zealand accepted the proposal as a basis for discussion.
                                    Australia, Argentina, and Chile rejected on grounds of
                                    sovereignty. The latter took the position as well that

                                    exception to this. France favored some scheme of

                                            try to modify the proposed terms of the trust agreement,

                                            block similarly any amendments unacceptable to them.
                                            Such an impasse, however, would hardly contribute to a

                                            would be difficult to support. If the USSR’s status as a
                                            “state directly concerned” were accepted, it could claim
                                            the right to participate in the drafting of the terms of
                                            trusteeship and would have a strong basis for claiming a

                        itself was about to propose talks leading to merging of claims among present

                    <p>The South African Ambassador came to my office at 3:00 p.m. today, by
                        appointment made yesterday. He handed me an Aide-Mémoire classified “Secret”
                        dated October 3, 1957,<note n="2" xml:id="d336fn2">Not printed; a copy is
                            attached to the source text.</note> the last paragraph of which reads as
                        follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Union Government understands that discussions about Antarctica
                                between representatives of the United States and certain
                                Commonwealth Governments are expected to take place in the near
                                future. To the extent that these discussions may have a bearing on
                                any regime for the future control and administration of Antarctica,
                                the Union Government, in view of its real interest in the area,
                                would appreciate it most highly if they could be invited to
                                participate.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The Ambassador referred to recent talks in London between certain
                        Commonwealth countries in which the subject of Antarctica was discussed. He
                        said he understood that certain further talks were to be held in Washington
                        on the same subject, and that as indicated in the Aide-Mémoire his
                        Government was desirous of participating in such discussions.</p>
                    <p>I said that of course the United States Government appreciated the interest
                        of the Union of South Africa in this matter, and as indicated last year it
                        welcomed the opportunity to exchange information and views in regard to the
                        Antarctic.</p>
                    <p>With reference to talks in Washington, to which the Ambassador referred, I
                        stated that the initiative for such informal discussions had emanated from
                        London, and that since the United States was not the initiator I could not
                        very well presume to extend an invitation to any other Government to
                        participate. Furthermore, I said I did not see how I could very well make an
                        adequate reply to the South African proposal without prior consultation with
                        the representatives of the other interested Governments. I said that I would
                        gladly consult them as soon as possible, and thereafter <pb n="714"
                            xml:id="pg_714" facs="0740"/>prepare an Aide-Mémoire in reply to the one
                        which he just handed me.</p>
                    <p>I took advantage of the occasion to point out that quite aside from the
                        substance of any views or ideas which might be advanced in the course of
                        exploratory conversations, the mere fact that any such talks were being held
                        was considered to be highly confidential. All concerned were desirous of
                        avoiding even a semblance of any unusual political activity at this time in
                        regard to Antarctica which might have the unfortunate effect of
                        precipitating action by the Soviet Union. Furthermore, other claimant
                        countries would probably be disturbed if it were felt that the question of
                        Antarctica were being discussed by a group of countries without their own
                        participation.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador du Plessis readily agreed with the validity of these observations,
                        and conceded the delicacy with which the matter would be handled. He added a
                        further thought, namely, that if the talks were to become too widely known,
                        or their importance exaggerated it might provoke India into taking further
                        initiative in the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>I reiterated my desire to stay in close touch with the Ambassador in regard
                        to matters of mutual interest in regard to Antarctica and assured him again
                        that I would consult with other representatives in regard to possible South
                        African participation in the forthcoming talks.</p>
                    <p>We both agreed that an answer to the Aide-Mémoire might well be deferred
                        until after such consultation.</p>

                    <p>The Government of the United States of America has given careful
                        consideration to the Aide-Mémoire of the Embassy of the Union of South
                        Africa, dated October 3, 1957, in which there are set forth the reasons
                        which in the Union Government’s view justify the Union’s association with
                        any organization or machinery which might be devised for the control and
                        administration of Antarctica.</p>

                    <p>The Aide-Mémoire of the South African Embassy states that the Union
                        Government, in view of its real interest in the area, would appreciate it
                        most highly if they could be invited to participate in discussions about
                        Antarctica between representatives of the United States and certain
                        Commonwealth Governments. It is assumed that this suggestion relates to
                        general or formal discussions of a multilateral character, and would not
                        necessarily refer to informal conversations which representatives of the
                        Government of the United States may have with the representatives of other
                        Governments interested in the Antarctic area, particularly if the initiative
                        for such informal conversations comes from another Government.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States of America welcomes the expression of
                        views of the Union Government, and is glad to reiterate its willingness to
                        consult with that Government at any time in regard to Antarctic problems,
                        and to exchange information in this field of mutual interest to the fullest
                        extent practicable. It is believed that this policy of consultation will
                        serve the purposes of the two Governments without the necessity of either
                        one participating in all informal talks which representatives of either
                        Government may have with representatives of other Governments on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>During the current International Geophysical Year a wide range of scientific
                        activities are being carried on in the Antarctic area by a number of
                        countries, as the Union Government is aware, and accordingly the Government
                        of the United States of America feels that it will be particularly useful
                        during this time to maintain close contact with the Government of the Union
                        of South Africa in the hope that close cooperation between the two
                        Governments will lead to satisfactory solutions of any problems that may be
                        encountered.</p>

                        Antarctica—United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Norway, France,
                        Argentina, and Chile. There are two large unclaimed sectors. The United
                        States has important potential claims but has filed no formal claim. The
                        Soviet Union has been engaging in extensive activity in Antarctica in
                        connection with the current International Geophysical Year but has not as
                        yet filed a claim. Japan, Belgium, and South Africa are also participating
                        in the <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> program in Antarctica and have
                        made no claims. Attached as <gloss target="#t_TAB1">Tab</gloss> A is a map

                            AN INTERNATIONAL REGIME FOR ANTARCTICA</p>
                        <p>The problem of possible Soviet participation in an international regime
                            for Antarctica will be confronted when the time comes to invite certain
                            countries to a conference for the purpose of establishing such a regime.
                            If such invitations are issued, it is assumed that they will be extended
                            to all the present claimant countries, i.e., Australia, New Zealand,
                            United Kingdom, Norway, France, Chile, and Argentina. If additional
                            countries are invited to participate, both the Union of South Africa and
                            the Soviet Union will have to be considered. (Possibly some thought
                            should likewise be given to extending invitations to countries having a
                            less substantial interest in Antarctica, such as Japan, Belgium, and
                            perhaps Germany.) Both the Union of South Africa and the Soviet Union
                            have made known their desire to be included in any international
                            settlement relating to Antarctica.</p>

                                around Antarctica in 1819–1820. In recent years Soviet whaling
                                activities in the Antarctic region have been important. Soviet
                                scientific activities in Antarctica during the International
                                Geophysical Year are quite extensive. Even though it is held that
                                such scientific activities constitute no valid basis for territorial
                                claims or political action, the fact that the Russians apparently
                                expect to continue being active in Antarctica beyond the end of the

                                exclude them from any international regime. Inviting the Russians to

                                already there. Failure to invite them would not cause them to

                                “neutralists”. This in turn would again stimulate proposals for the
                                United Nations to take over the administration of Antarctica. (While
                                this latter solution might conceivably be better than no solution at
                                all, it is believed that an international regime limited to the
                                relatively few states directly concerned would operate more

                                <item>If no agreement is concluded, then the United States would
                                    continue (with the other seven claimant powers) asserting
                                    sovereignty over a portion of Antarctica, and reserving rights
                                    in other portions, in accordance with the U.S. proclamation
                                    which would have already been issued. This new situation,

                                    territorial claims by the United States and other friendly
                                    powers, would probably be better than the present situation
                                    where there is a large unclaimed sector which the Soviet Union
                                    might, if it chose, lay claim to at any time.</item>

                                    Soviet claims and in controlling Soviet activities in
                                    Antarctica. Such a joint association, even though falling short
                                    of a complete Antarctica settlement, would be preferable to the

                            <item>The U.S. is believed to have the technical capability to establish
                                successfully a small scientific satellite of the earth in the fairly
                                near future. Recent studies by the Department of Defense have
                                indicated that a small scientific satellite weighing 5 to 10 pounds
                                can be launched into an orbit about the earth using adaptations of
                                existing rocket components. If a decision to embark on such a
                                program is made promptly, the U.S. will probably be able to
                                establish and track such a satellite within the period
                                1957–58.</item>

                            <item>On April 16, 1955, the Soviet Government announced that a
                                permanent high-level, interdepartmental commission for
                                interplanetary communications has been created in the Astronomic
                                Council of the USSR Academy of Sciences. A group of Russia’s top
                                scientists is now believed to be working on a satellite program. In
                                September 1954 the Soviet Academy of Sciences announced the
                                establishment of the Tsiolkovsky Gold Medal which would be awarded

                            <item>Some substantial benefits may be derived from establishing small
                                scientific satellites. By careful observation and the analysis of
                                actual orbital decay patterns, much information will be gained about
                                air drag at extreme altitudes and about the fine details of the
                                shape of and the gravitational field of the earth. Such satellites
                                promise to provide direct and continuous determination of the total
                                ion content of the ionosphere. These significant findings will find
                                ready application in defense communication and missile research.
                                When large instrumented satellites are established, a number of
                                other kinds of scientific data may be acquired. The attached

                                the nation which first is successful in launching a satellite. The
                                inference of such a demonstration of advanced technology and its
                                unmistakable relationship to intercontinental ballistic missile
                                technology might have important repercussions on the political
                                determination of free world countries to resist Communist threats,
                                especially if the USSR were to be the first to establish a
                                satellite. Furthermore, a small scientific satellite will provide a
                                test of the principle of “Freedom of Space”. The implications of
                                this principle are being studied within the Executive Branch.
                                However, preliminary studies indicate that there is no obstacle
                                under international law to the launching of such a satellite.</item>

                            <item>It should be emphasized that a satellite would constitute no
                                active military offensive threat to any country over which it might
                                pass. Although a large satellite might conceivably serve to launch a
                                guided missile at a ground target, it will always be a poor choice
                                for the purpose. A bomb could not be dropped from a satellite on a
                                target below, because anything dropped from a satellite would simply
                                continue alongside in the orbit.</item>

                                    perturbation is caused by the oblateness of the earth. Its

                        <p>3. In addition to the scientific values listed above, some of which are
                            clearly relevant to missile and anti-missile research and development
                            programs of the Department of Defense, it may be noted that military
                            communications programs will be enhanced by improvements in knowledge of
                            the ionosphere and by improved knowledge of the rate of earth rotation.
                            To this list must also be added the direct values of experience in
                            organization, operation and logistics accruing to military missile
                            forces detailed to execute a scientific satellite firing program. It is
                            expected that the satellite will approximate the speed and altitude of
                            an intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>

                            Considerations</hi></p>
                        <p>4. If a perigee approximately 200 miles and an apogee approximately 1,000
                            miles are used to fix the desired orbit, the satellite will pass
                            completely around the earth in approximately 90 minutes. If an orbit
                            over the earth’s poles or an orbit inclined to the equator is selected,
                            the satellite will pass successively farther west of the launching point
                            on each revolution around the earth. This means that an individual
                            tracking station set up for inclined orbits will not be in an observing
                            position for every revolution. The optimum location for tracking polar
                            orbits is at or near the poles. On the other hand, an equatorial orbit
                            will place each observing station in position to observe every circuit
                            of the satellite. Artificial satellites in a low roughly circular orbit
                            will appear optically similar to a 5.6 magnitude star moving at a high
                            angular rate. Optical observations in broad daylight will be
                            impracticable and observations when the <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729"
                                facs="0755"/>satellite is in the earth’s shadow will also be
                            impracticable unless the satellite is illuminated. This means that
                            experiments depending on passive optical tracking of a satellite cannot
                            be conducted except during 50 minutes at dawn and 50 minutes at dusk. An
                            inclined orbit would thus materially reduce the usable data per station
                            for experiments based on passive optical observations. The usefulness of
                            the satellite and the selection of the desirable orbit is, therefore,
                            closely related to the degree to which the satellite can be acquired and
                            tracked by electronic techniques as well as optical.</p>

                        <p>7. The launching of a scientific satellite does not appear to threaten in
                            any serious way the safety of air transportation at normal altitudes,
                            nor the safety of personnel and property on the ground. All of the
                            scientific satellites discussed above would be launched from locations
                            where the initial flight of the booster system would be over water. At
                            the end of this stage the booster rocket, which is the largest and
                            potentially most lethal part of the satellite, would separate and fall
                            into the water. Normal precautions taken in launching ordinary guided
                            missiles would suffice to assure adequate safety of the launch and
                            booster phases. The orbiting vehicle in all cases of both instrumented

                            />would be designed with the objective in mind that the entire device
                            would disintegrate and to a large extent vaporize under the heat of
                            re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere. This vehicle would, therefore,
                            create negligible hazards after re-entering the atmosphere.</p>

                                to contribute to the world body of scientific knowledge through
                                study of the satellite in flight. Needless to say, the offer of
                                sharing knowledge would not be extended to the method of

                                used to good effect by us in the event that there should be a

                                threatening. We should, alternatively, be ready to meet a Soviet

                                shorter timetable or even, at some date, an announcement, true or

                            corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that it might be possible
                        to do this at a later time.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> warned that the

                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5520 should be very carefully worked
                        out. Otherwise the public relations effects could be harmful to the United
                        States. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that he
                        thought that the auspices which it was proposed that the U.S. use in
                        launching the earth satellite (the International Geophysical Year) would be
                        effective in meeting the problem cited by Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired whether it
                        would take expensive and complicated instruments to observe the movements of
                        the earth satellite. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>
                        replied that at certain times in its revolutions about the earth the
                        satellite could be seen with ordinary field glasses. More powerful
                        instruments would be required at other times.</p>
                    <p>After further discussion, the President inquired whether any members of the
                        Council perceived any objection to an attempt by the U.S. to launch such a
                        satellite. There were no objections from members of the Council. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> observed that it was
                        very important to make this attempt, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1"
                            >Rockefeller</persName> suggested that the announcement of such an

                                Cutler</persName>.</note> explained the problems which confronted
                        the development of an earth satellite, and analyzed the recommendations of
                        the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board for Council action on
                        this subject (copy of briefing note filed in the minutes of the meeting).
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> then suggested that
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> speak first, to be
                        followed by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Alan Waterman</persName>,
                        Director, National Science Foundation.</p>
                    <p>After a moment’s hesitation, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> said he did have one point he wished to make. The
                        proposed record of action made provision for avoidance by the earth
                        satellite program of any interference with the Defense Department programs
                        for the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>. While this was sound, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> pointed out that there
                        were other programs and projects on “our Master Urgency List”<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d343fn5">Not further identified.</note> with which the earth
                        satellite program should not come into conflict. Accordingly, he suggested a
                        priority for the earth satellite program just under the items listed in the
                        Defense Department’s Master Urgency List. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> also indicated his support for the
                        original program designed to try to launch six earth satellites. He
                        concluded with a warning that the earth satellite program must not be
                        permitted to limit or interfere with major Defense Department programs.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> opened with a statement
                        that American scientists generally were eager to see the earth satellite
                        program carried out very actively. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1"
                            >Waterman</persName> believed that this could be done if we were to add
                        six more satellites to the original six planned for in implementation of the
                        policy set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5520. He reminded
                        the Council that the National Science Foundation had made a supplementary
                        request for funds in the amount of $28 million for the earth satellite
                        program. There was plainly no reluctance on the part of Congress to provide
                        additional funds for this project. This request on Congress for additional
                        funds was designed by the National Science Foundation to cover as far as
                        possible the cost of adding six additional satellites to the six originally
                        planned. On the other hand, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1"
                            >Waterman</persName> said, the National Science Foundation was now
                        willing to leave the question of an additional six satellites open, provided
                        the question was kept under continuous review. In any case, he insisted, it
                        was essential to try to get at least one and perhaps several successful
                        flights of an earth satellite. If there were several such successful
                        flights, we would have much more complete and precise scientific
                        information.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> then explained that there
                        were two particular aspects of the earth satellite program deserving of
                        special emphasis. <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0762"/>First, the
                        scientific significance of the program was very considerable. In
                        illustration of this point Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1"
                            >Waterman</persName> cited several instances of scientific data which
                        could be expected as a result of the successful launching of an earth
                        satellite. Information of great value for meteorology would be certain to be
                        achieved. Information of value with regard to communications could also be
                        expected, and this latter information would be of great interest to the
                        Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>The second point of emphasis was the international nature of the commitment
                        the United States had made to launch an earth satellite. This announcement
                        had been enthusiastically acclaimed by scientists and scholars all over the
                        world. Accordingly, both from the point of view of our own immediate
                        national interest and from the aspect of peaceful world cooperation, the
                        earth satellite program should be vigorously carried out under U.S.
                        leadership. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> concluded by
                        predicting that this investment would pay off in increased good will towards
                        the United States from all the other countries in the world.</p>
                    <p>When Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> had concluded his
                        statement, the President said he could perceive no objection to the
                        provision of additional funds necessary to carry out the program for the
                        original six satellites. On the other hand, he did not see any need now or
                        any reason to expand this program by adding six additional satellites. He
                        therefore recommended that we push on with the program of six satellites
                        despite the additional cost, and that we make the decision to add additional
                        satellites only if we subsequently found that we needed additional
                        scientific information.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he strongly
                        approved the recommendation of the Planning Board now before the
                        Council—namely, to proceed with the original program, with the proviso that
                        a further report on the need for an additional six satellites be submitted
                        to the Council next autumn. The President repeated his view that it might
                        prove possible and desirable to add an additional six satellites later on if
                        success were achieved by the present program.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> reminded the Council
                        of some of the facts in the early development of the earth satellite
                        program. He pointed out that originally the program called for the launching
                        of a simple, comparatively uninstrumented earth satellite about the size of
                        a basketball. As the program developed in the Department of Defense, plans
                        were agreed upon for elaboration of the instrumentation of the satellites.
                        If such instrumentation became too elaborate, there were bound to be high
                        costs as well as possible interference by the earth satellite program with
                        the ballistic missile programs of the Defense Department.</p>
                    <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0763"/>
                    <p>The President said that it had been his understanding when the Council first
                        adopted <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5520, that it had been informed
                        that the successful launching of an earth satellite might be expected to
                        provide information useful to the programs for developing the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IRBM1"
                            >IRBM</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>,
                        however, pointed out that it was likely to be the other way round, and that
                        the missile programs would be helpful to the earth satellite program rather
                        than the reverse. In any event, there was no evidence available at present
                        that the launching of an earth satellite would provide any notable
                        assistance to the ballistic missile programs of the Defense Department. The
                        President said he judged he was mistaken, and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> went on to say that much the same
                        scientists and technicians were working on the missile programs and on the
                        earth satellite program, and there were by no means too many such
                        knowledgeable people. There was also, of course, a severe budgetary
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> wondered if the
                        National Security Council must not now decide to carry out such programs as
                        this on a more selective basis. There was a terrific financial burden on our
                        country already, and military costs were steadily increasing. All these
                        programs must be set in a better order. The earth satellite program was an
                        interesting thing and it might even prove helpful; but was the earth
                        satellite program really a pressing and urgent matter? Were we, for
                        instance, willing to cut out an infantry division or a certain number of
                        B–52 aircraft, in order to launch successfully an earth satellite? If we add
                        something to the Defense Department programs we should be prepared to cancel
                        some other program. We were in no position to do everything that seemed to
                        us interesting and useful. If we put these programs in some order of
                        priority we would go a long way to help solve our budgetary problems.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> called the Council’s
                        attention to the fact that the action proposed on this subject by the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board confined itself to
                        reaffirming the original program to launch six satellites. Nevertheless,
                        replied Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, the cost
                        of even the original program was already going out of sight. This project,
                        he insisted, ought to be lined up against other Defense Department programs
                        and projects to see which one of the latter we cancel out in favor of
                        developing the earth satellite.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had not been notably enthusiastic about the earth
                        satellite program when it had first been considered by the National Security
                        Council, but that we certainly could not back out of it now. The President
                        could not imagine the United States having made an announcement that it
                        proposed to launch an earth satellite and then failing to deliver on its
                        commitment. To this Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> replied by proposing that we spend the sum of $20
                        million originally estimated to be the cost of launching an earth <pb
                            n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0764"/>satellite, and see whether we could
                        get one up into its orbit for this amount of money.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that the
                        successful launching of an earth satellite might one day provide information
                        of very considerable value to the defense of the United States. He was
                        presently engaged in trying hard to prevent the Soviets from having access
                        to valuable secrets of the Defense Department. Accordingly, he was much
                        interested to know whether, if the earth satellite were successful, all the
                        information we obtained from its flight was going to be made known to all
                        the nations of the world, as seemed to be proposed by the people responsible
                        for the International Geophysical Year programs. If this proved to be the
                        case, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked how we
                        were expected to keep ahead of the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> pointed out to the
                        President that there were two parts to the problem before the National
                        Security Council. One was the recommendation to go ahead with the
                        development of the six-satellite program. The other was the question of the
                        need for additional satellites. The answer to this would come later.</p>
                    <p>The President said he understood this perfectly, but that he wished to ask
                        some questions about the nature of the instrumentation to be used in the
                        earth satellite. In response, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWM1"
                            >Holaday</persName> explained that the present vehicle weighed only
                        about twenty pounds and that, of course, there was therefore not much room
                        for elaborate instrumentation. On the other hand, if we developed a series
                        of earth satellites we could put differing instruments in each of them and
                        thus greatly add to the information which would be obtained from their
                        flights. He also emphasized that the six-satellite program was the essential
                        back-up—the number necessary for reasonable assurance that at least one
                        satellite could be successfully launched. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWM1">Holaday</persName> expressed the opinion that if,
                        after six tries, we failed to get at least one of the earth satellites
                        successfully launched and in its orbit, we would have to have recourse to a
                        radically different launching vehicle such as the Redstone missile or the
                        like. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> interrupted at
                        this point to indicate that when one got into the area of alternative
                        launching vehicles such as Redstone, there was real danger of a conflict
                        between the earth satellite program and the ballistic missile programs of
                        the Defense Department.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then pointed out
                        that when the Council originally considered the proposal to launch an earth
                        satellite the estimated cost was stated to be $20 million. Now we find
                        ourselves talking in terms of $60 or $90 million. The President, however,
                        pointed out that we were talking of $60 million, not $90 million, since $60
                        million was now estimated to be the cost of the six-satellite program, and
                        $90 million the cost of an additional six <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739"
                            facs="0765"/>satellites, which was not, for the time being at least,
                        before the Council. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                        indicated that he was prepared to go up to $60 million, but not to $90
                        million.</p>
                    <p>The President then put various other questions, relating to the manner of
                        launching an earth satellite. He expressed the view that if two out of the
                        six launchings of an earth satellite failed, it would not be sensible to go
                        on to try to launch the remaining four with the same kind of missile. He
                        doubted whether, accordingly, the additional four would amount to much as an
                        added factor of safety in ensuring a successful launching.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> repeated his
                        recommendation that the Council authorize the expenditure of the $20 million
                        originally estimated, and see what we could get for that amount of money.
                        Thereafter we could take another look. The President replied that the
                        trouble with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s
                        recommendation was that funds might run out and we would have to stop
                        somewhere in the middle of our effort to launch an earth satellite. He still
                        wanted to know what assurance we would get from the attempt to launch six
                        satellites that we would not already have secured from the effort to launch
                        the first two. Would we try to launch all six of these satellites with the
                        same type of launching missile? This did not seem very sensible to the
                        President, who repeated his view that if we failed on the first two or three
                        attempts we would have to shift to a different launching vehicle. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> attempted to explain to
                        the President the need for at least six satellites. He pointed out that
                        success in getting an earth satellite into its orbit depended on the
                        precision with which the satellite was aimed and the precise speed with
                        which it was sent into the atmosphere. If there was an error in either of
                        these respects the satellite could not be got into its orbit. It must be
                        pointed just right and have the exact speed. One could not be sure of
                        obtaining these results with less than six satellite launchings. The
                        President said that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>
                        apparently meant that six satellites represented the minimum factor of
                        safety. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> replied that
                        this was emphatically the view of the American scientists. The President
                        then said that he surrendered, and certainly would not engage in a fight
                        with all the scientists of the nation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed himself as
                        opposed to developing very much instrumentation in the earth satellite until
                        such time as we had succeeded in getting one up into its orbit. Thereafter
                        he would be quite willing to equip the others with more detailed and
                        elaborate instrumentation. The President said he disagreed with this view.
                        As far as he could determine, instrumentation was not a very significant
                        cost factor in the earth satellite program, and he would provide
                        instrumentation for all six of the satellites from the outset.</p>
                    <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0766"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then reverted to the
                        budgetary aspects of the earth satellite program. The Director of the Budget
                        expressed the view that since it was now going to cost so much more than
                        originally estimated to cover the program for six earth satellites, it would
                        be best if the funds which had been requested for an additional six
                        satellites be applied to the cost of carrying out the original program for
                        six satellites. The President expressed the view that the Council should
                        stick to the original program of six satellites, but should add the
                        desirable instrumentation, which he understood would not be a heavy cost
                        item. The President repeated his disapproval of a program for an additional
                        six earth satellites.</p>
                    <p>Continuing on the budgetary aspects, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> pointed out that we seemed about to spend $60 million
                        on the earth satellite program over a period of two years. Some 3000
                        scientists and other people would be involved in the business. We would have
                        to pay them approximately $10,000 a year apiece, since good smart scientists
                        and technicians were required, and they were very hard to come by.</p>
                    <p>The President again indicated that the priority assigned to the earth
                        satellite program should be below what Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> had referred to as the priorities assigned in his
                        “Master Urgency List”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName>
                        pointed out that the President’s suggestion corresponded to the
                        recommendations formulated by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        Planning Board. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> asked
                        whether, if such a recommendation were approved by the National Security
                        Council, the need for an additional six satellites could be kept under
                        review by the Council. The President replied in the affirmative, and
                        indicated that he would expect a progress report on <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5520 to be presented to the National Security Council in
                        the fall of this year. At that time the Council could again consider the
                        need for an additional six satellites.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he had just been
                        reminded by Secretary Robertson<note n="6" xml:id="d343fn6">Reuben B.
                            Robertson, Deputy Secretary of Defense.</note> that it would be
                        necessary to go to the Congress now to get the additional $20 million which
                        would now be required to carry on the six-satellite program. The President
                        replied that we should get whatever we have to get to carry out the original
                        program. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that
                        in any event he could not squeeze any more money out of current Defense
                        Department funds so that such funds could be diverted from other programs in
                        order to make up the deficit on the earth satellite program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Anderson</persName> inquired about the “Master
                        Urgency List”, of which he would have to have knowledge if the Council’s
                        record of action indicated that the priority for the earth satellite program
                        was to be below the priority assigned to programs on this master list. <pb
                            n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0767"/>Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> suggested that the Council action
                        indicate that priority for the earth satellite program should come just
                        after the priority assigned to items on the “Master Urgency List”. The
                        President said that in that case he certainly wanted to see the Defense
                        Department’s “Master Urgency List”. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> replied that it would be very good for the President
                        to see this list and be aware of its content. The President then suggested
                        that it might be wise to give the “Master Urgency List” an <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> number and to be sure that the Council
                        action on the earth satellite program did not interfere with the priorities
                        assigned to the “Master Urgency List”, which included items of vital
                        importance for the defense of the United States.</p>

                            result in loss of U.S. scientific prestige that would be compounded by

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> briefed the Council on the
                        contents of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5520. In the course of his
                        briefing he analyzed the issue between the Department of Defense and the
                        National Science Foundation as to whether <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743"
                            facs="0769"/>the program should involve the attempt to launch six or
                        twelve satellites. He also pointed to the considerable rise in the costs of
                        the program since it had first been adopted by the National Security
                        Council. He indicated that Dr. Furnas,<note n="6" xml:id="d344fn6">Clifford
                            C Furnas.</note> Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and
                        Development, would outline the position of the Department of Defense in
                        favor of the present program for launching six satellites. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>, Director of the National Science
                        Foundation, would subsequently present his views in favor of a program for
                        twelve satellites. Before hearing from either speaker, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> suggested that it would be useful
                        for the Director of Central Intelligence to report briefly on what was known
                        about the Soviet program for launching an earth satellite. (A copy of Mr.

                    <p>Upon the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’
                        remarks, Dr. Furnas briefly summarized the progress to date of the U.S.
                        program to launch an earth satellite in accordance with <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5520. In the course of his remarks he
                        pointed out that the final preliminary test would occur in September 1957.
                        After this date all six satellites would be in existence and ready to
                        launch. The first attempt actually to launch a satellite was scheduled for
                        October 31, 1957. Dr. Furnas expressed the view that at least one of the six
                        launchings would prove successful in getting the satellite into its orbit.
                        After describing very briefly the instrumentation of the earth satellites
                        and the means envisaged for tracking them, Dr. Furnas indicated that the
                        program was essentially on schedule.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the recommendations of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        Planning Board, Dr. Furnas stated that the Department of Defense concurred
                        in two of the three recommendations of the Planning Board, viz., paragraphs
                        8 and 10; but did not concur in paragraph 9, in which the National Science
                        Foundation recommended a program for launching twelve instrumented
                        satellites rather than the six currently envisaged in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5520. He then listed the several reasons
                        for the non-concurrence of the Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Dr. Furnas’ report, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1"
                            >Cutler</persName> called on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1"
                            >Waterman</persName> to provide the Council with his views in favor of
                        the recommendation advanced in paragraph 9.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> indicated that he would
                        first like to call the Council’s attention to developments and changes in
                        this program which had occurred since the Council last considered the
                        subject. <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0770"/>Following this he provided
                        a brief picture of what the satellite really means, stressing that he would
                        approach the subject … from the point of view of a civilian scientist, ….
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> pointed out that an
                        earth satellite was unique as a means of observing space, because once it
                        was in position it observed without the need of any unit of propulsion.
                        Accordingly, if successfully launched, the earth satellite would provide us
                        with a continuous record of information on outer space. Such information
                        would be of enormous value ….</p>
                    <p>In view of the above possibilities, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1"
                            >Waterman</persName> believed that ordinary prudence suggested that we
                        do all we possibly could to achieve this kind of information. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> also pointed out that the United
                        States was now taking the lead—as compared to the Soviets—in the development
                        of instrumentation for satellites. While he believed that the Russians might
                        well surprise us in the achievement of a launching unit, he did not believe
                        that they were likely to equal us in the instrumentation of the satellite
                        itself, although they will do their utmost to try to get ahead of us in this
                        area also.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing remarks, continued Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1"
                            >Waterman</persName>, explained the recommendations of the National
                        Science Foundation for a program to include six extra satellites. Such a
                        program of twelve launchings Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1"
                            >Waterman</persName> believed would guarantee at least one successful
                        launching. The added merit of the twelve-satellite program would consist of
                        the greatly increased scientific data which we could anticipate.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the problem of financing six extra satellites, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> pointed out his view that the
                        actual expenditure for the six satellites would not necessarily occur next
                        year, but would come after the completion of the present program, at the end
                        of two years. If, having restricted ourselves to a program of only six
                        satellites, we have to start all over again with a new program two years
                        from now, the ultimate costs would be much larger than they would be if we
                        were simply to add six additional satellites to the present program.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> said he would close his
                        remarks by pointing out that the program which he advocated was intended to
                        respond directly to scientific purposes, and it would in addition provide an
                        excellent start on the program recently outlined by Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> in the United Nations, calling for
                        supervision and control of the exploitation of outer space.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>’s
                        statement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> invited him to
                        refresh the Council on certain basic facts with respect to the speed and the
                        orbit of the earth satellite. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1"
                            >Waterman</persName> replied that the orbit would be elliptical, and
                        that the satellite would vary in its distance from the earth within a spread
                        of 200 to 800 miles. The speed of the satellite was estimated to be 18,000
                        miles per <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0771"/>hour, and it would circle
                        the earth in a period of one and a half hours.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> then summarized the three
                        recommendations of the Planning Board report on the satellite program, and
                        pointed out that the total costs of the program had risen from the initial
                        estimate of some $20 million to $83 million for launching six satellites. He
                        then pointed out that the question before the Council was whether it was
                        desired to authorize a program involving six additional satellites.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>
                        when it was expected that we would launch our first earth satellite. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> replied that the first
                        launching would occur in October of this year, and that the remaining five
                        satellites would be launched at intervals of two months thereafter. The
                        President then inquired as to the costs of the satellites themselves, not
                        including the launching and other costs of the program. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> replied that the sum was $10
                        million. Dr. Furnas added that the cost of six additional satellites would
                        be $30 million if we also included the costs of the launchings.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stated his belief
                        that if we were to add six additional satellites to the program we would be
                        crowding ourselves and incurring very great expense. The fact is that we
                        were running out of money in the Department of Defense, and that was the
                        real issue before the Council this morning. Looking at the matter strictly
                        from the point of view of the Defense Department, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added that if we were going to spend
                        another $30 million there are other things that the Department of Defense
                        would like to buy for that sum of money. Accordingly, rather than crowd the
                        earth satellite program too much by adding six satellites, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> advocated postponing the
                        decision for a year.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated his general agreement with the position taken by
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, pointing out that
                        we were involved with a program the cost of which, from its inception to the
                        present, had risen from $20 million to over $80 million. We were talking of
                        adding additional satellites and spending additional money without waiting
                        to see what we could achieve with our current program of trying to launch
                        six satellites. The President said he thought that the current program was a
                        good program, and that we should see what results it produced before putting
                        another $30 million into the program. This kind of gamble he did not feel
                        was justified, and he closed with a statement that we should complete the
                        present program before adding another.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> said he would like to
                        address a question to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>.
                        Suppose, he inquired, we were successful in actually launching three of the
                        six satellites called for by the present program. Would Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> feel that even in this event it
                        would be desirable to add six additional satellites to the existing program?
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>
                        <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0772"/>replied that the real question was
                        this: We believe that we will get at least one successful launching out of
                        the present program of six. But there was so much more that we wanted to
                        learn than we were likely to learn from only one successful launching that
                        he believed we ought to make sure the continuation of the program if this
                        proved necessary.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> stated that as far
                        as he could see, all the Council was talking about was whether we should now
                        proceed to obligate ourselves in this unknown field for additional funds at
                        the present time in order that we may save money in the future if we decide
                        to go ahead with a bigger program at some future time. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he was opposed to this course
                        of action in view of our present financial situation and our need to be more
                        selective in our national security expenditures.</p>
                    <p>The President said that once we have succeeded in getting one satellite into
                        its orbit we will then desire to make a decision as to how many more such
                        satellites we need to have. This might well prove to be more than six.
                        Perhaps we should even want to launch an earth satellite once every
                        year.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> said that he thought that
                        what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> had just said in
                        his statement, about the beneficial effect on our missiles program of the
                        information we would get from an earth satellite, was perhaps the most
                        significant aspect of the satellite program if one had regard for the vast
                        sums of money that the Government is devoting to the program for achieving
                        intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> asked the President if he
                        might read the recommendations of Dr. I.I. Rabi, Chairman of the Science
                        Advisory Committee of <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss>, on the earth
                        satellite program.</p>
                    <p>After Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> had finished
                        reading Dr. Rabi’s recommendations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1"
                            >Cutler</persName> turned to Dr. Furnas and asked if the following
                        proposal offered a solution to the dilemma: After three successful
                        launchings, could the Defense Department then decide on the need for an
                        additional six satellites? Dr. Furnas replied that this seemed to him a good
                        idea, and that such a course of action would not involve a very heavy
                        additional cost. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                        also thought well of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName>’s
                        suggestion.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>
                        to interpret Dr. Rabi’s recommendations. Was Dr. Rabi, asked the President,
                        calling for a program now comprising twelve instead of six satellites? Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> replied that the
                        position taken by Dr. Rabi was consistent with that advocated by Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>. The President then
                        stated that we should go ahead with our present program and later take up
                        the question of future programs, even though such a course of action would
                        involve additional costs later on.</p>
                    <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0773"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> then inquired whether the
                        Council would agree to bringing up the issue of additional launchings after
                        three launchings had been attempted under the present program. The President
                        replied that he was not averse to the issue being brought up any time after
                        we had achieved one successful launching of an earth satellite. If we do
                        otherwise, we shall simply be gambling on something which it wasn’t
                        necessary to gamble on. Our future program ought to be based progressively
                        on what we find out in the course of implementing our present program.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> had summarized a
                        proposed Council action in accordance with the discussion, and after the
                        President had amended slightly Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1"
                            >Cutler</persName>’s proposed action, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he was obliged to raise the
                        question of financing the present program. The Department of Defense simply
                        did not have the funds necessary to cover the increased cost, now that it
                        was estimated that the total program would cost $83 million. The President
                        turned to the Director of the Budget, and said that he would simply have to
                        “scratch around” and get this additional $17 million out of existing
                        appropriations.</p>

                            >Cutler</persName> explained that another hike in the costs of this

                        the National Security Council. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1"
                            >Cutler</persName> said that there would be a presentation by Assistant

                        other officials of the Research and Engineering Division of the Department

                            >Cutler</persName>’s briefing note is filed in the minutes of the

                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> had finished his
                        briefing and had noted that the costs of the program had increased from the
                        original estimate (May 1955) of $15-20 million to the estimate of April
                        1957, of $110 million, he turned to call upon Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWM1">Holaday</persName> to present the Defense Department
                        report. The President, however, interrupted with a vigorous complaint to Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> that before he slid over
                        some very important facts it would be well to recall that the original <pb
                            n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0775"/>program, calling for six
                        satellites, was primarily a safety program designed to assure that at least
                        one of these six satellites could be successfully orbited. There was no
                        intention necessarily to launch six satellites. Another problem which
                        disturbed the President was the very costly instrumentation currently being
                        provided for the six satellites. Such costly instrumentation had not been
                        envisaged when <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5520 had originally been
                        approved by the President. The President therefore stressed that the element
                        of national prestige, so strongly emphasized in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 5520, depended on getting a satellite into its orbit, and
                        not on the instrumentation of the scientific satellite.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> explained that he had not
                        intentionally passed over these problems, and that they would be dealt with
                        in the presentations by the Defense Department which were now to follow. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> then called on Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWM1">Holaday</persName>, who in turn stated that
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDJP1">Hagen</persName> would make the first
                        report on the nature and performance of the earth satellite program and the
                        schedule of test launchings. (A copy of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDJP1"
                            >Hagen</persName>’s report is filed in the minutes of the meeting.<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d345fn4">Not found.</note>)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDJP1">Hagen</persName> was followed by Assistant
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWM1">Holaday</persName>, who confined
                        himself to an analysis of the cost aspects of the program to launch an earth
                        satellite, with particular emphasis on the reasons which had led to the
                        marked increases in the estimated costs of completing the program. He
                        concluded his remarks with certain recommendations as to ways and means of
                        funding the remainder of the program.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWM1"
                        >Holaday</persName>’s remarks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1"
                            >Cutler</persName> called on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BDDW1"
                            >Bronk</persName> for a statement of the scientific aspects and
                        importance of the earth satellite program. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BDDW1"
                            >Bronk</persName> said that he would divide his brief report into three
                        main parts. He dealt first with what he described as the immediate practical
                        values to be derived from the successful orbiting of a scientific satellite.
                        Among these, he stressed … information on the determinants of weather; and
                        lastly, the influence of outer space on communications. He commented on the
                        intense anticipation with which scientists were waiting for the receipt of
                        this kind of scientific information.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BDDW1">Bronk</persName> stated that the second
                        aspect of his analysis would be concerned with what might be described as
                        the spiritual aspects of the program. If a satellite were successfully
                        orbited, it would constitute the movement of man into an entirely new area
                        of the universe into which he had never moved before. This was, accordingly,
                        a challenging adventure, and if it were successfully concluded would mark a
                        whole new chapter—indeed, a new epoch—in science and history.</p>
                    <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0776"/>
                    <p>Finally, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BDDW1">Bronk</persName> said he would
                        touch on the international aspects of the earth satellite program. These
                        aspects, he said, were of very great concern to our scientists. The fact
                        that our earth satellite program was being carried out in connection with
                        the International Geophysical Year and in association with scientific groups
                        from many foreign countries, would bring our scientists into a relationship
                        with the scientists of other countries which could be very significant. We
                        are taking the lead, but we are associated with a variety of other
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> then called on Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>, who said he would
                        confine himself to discussing the matter of responsibility for funding the
                        earth satellite program, as between the National Science Foundation and the
                        Department of Defense. The gist of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1"
                            >Waterman</persName>’s remarks was that if it proved necessary to go to
                        the Congress for a supplemental appropriation in order to complete the
                        program set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5520, the
                        Department of Defense was in a much better position, and had a much clearer
                        obligation, to do so than did the National Science Foundation. On the other
                        hand, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> expressed the
                        earnest hope that some way might be found to provide for the costs of
                        completing this program without going up to the Congress with a request for
                        supplemental appropriations.</p>
                    <p>The President said that two thoughts had come to his mind at once as he had
                        listened to this series of reports and comments. In the first place, there
                        was no particular reason to assume that the latest estimate of the costs of
                        completing the program ($110 million) would prove firmer than the earlier
                        estimates. Indeed, it was quite possible that the costs of completing the
                        program would go to $150 million, or even higher. His second impression,
                        said the President, was that everybody wanted to duck responsibility for
                        finding the money to fund the program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> then requested the Director
                        of Central Intelligence to report on what we knew about the Soviet program
                        to launch an earth satellite, and on the world-wide effects of a U.S.
                        decision to abandon its own earth satellite program at this time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> indicated that the Soviets
                        had not followed through on their promise to provide the organizers of the
                        International Geophysical Year with the appropriate details of their
                        program, …. With respect to the effect of a U.S. abandonment of our program,
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the
                        program had been widely advertised and warmly welcomed throughout the world
                        of science. If the Soviets succeeded in orbiting a scientific satellite and
                        the United States did not even try to, the USSR would have achieved a
                        propaganda weapon which they could use to boast about the superiority of
                        Soviet scientists. In the premises, the Soviets would also emphasize the
                        propaganda theme that our abandonment <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751"
                            facs="0777"/>of this peaceful scientific program meant that we were
                        devoting the resources of our scientists to warlike preparations instead of
                        peaceful programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> then invited comments from
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied that when the earth
                        satellite program was first broached in the spring of 1955, it had been
                        clearly and publicly stated that any of the scientific information resulting
                        from the successful launching of an earth satellite would be made available
                        freely to the whole world. Accordingly, our earth satellite program partook
                        of the character of a pure research product rather than of the character of
                        directed research which the Department of Defense could appropriately
                        describe as vital to U.S. national security. Of course, continued Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, we in the Defense
                        Department do have some defense interest in the satellite program.
                        Nevertheless, it was not the kind of program which Defense could properly
                        underwrite and for which it could properly provide money, as it had done
                        lately, out of the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> emergency funds for
                        research and development. Indeed, Congress had already criticized the
                        Defense Department for allocating money out of its emergency funds to tide
                        over the earth satellite program, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                            >Wilson</persName> said he could not really blame Congressional critics
                        for their attitude. He complained that he was already having enough trouble
                        in providing money out of his emergency funds for research projects which
                        were truly vital to national defense.</p>
                    <p>The Director of the Budget pointed out to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> that the Department of Defense
                        Emergency Fund ran out each year and had to be renewed each year.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> inquired of Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> the views of the
                        Department of State, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>
                        replied that he felt much as did Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                            Dulles</persName>. The State Department favored completing the earth
                        satellite program because of the prestige it would confer on the United
                        States. He could not speak authoritatively of the problem of funding the
                        program, which he said did present a rather frightening picture. Asked for
                        his opinion, <persName corresp="#p_RAAWUSN1">Admiral</persName> Strauss<note
                            n="5" xml:id="d345fn5">Lewis L. Strauss, Chairman of the Atomic Energy
                            Commission.</note> replied that he concurred in the views of Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President then commented that there was one lesson to be learned from the
                        experience with the earth satellite program: In the future let us avoid any
                        bragging until we know we have succeeded in accomplishing our objectives.
                        The President then said that he would like to be informed as to how much the
                        increased costs of the earth satellite program derived from increased costs
                        of more elaborate instrumentation. Secondly, he wished to inquire whether
                        the <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0778"/>launching of an earth satellite
                        could be rendered easier if the satellite did not contain so much
                        instrumentation as currently planned.</p>
                    <p>In replying to the President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWM1"
                            >Holaday</persName> pointed out that the diameter of the earth satellite
                        had been reduced from thirty inches to twenty inches, although he admitted
                        that the instrumentation had become a little “gold-plated”, or at least
                        “chromium-plated”, as it had developed. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWM1">Holaday</persName> also admitted that at the start of
                        the earth satellite program we had not realized fully the requirements of
                        the velocity. Likewise, more observation stations were now going to be
                        established than had originally been thought necessary. Such items as these
                        helped to explain the increasing costs of the program.</p>
                    <p>The President responded by pointing out that although Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWM1">Holaday</persName> had said that the 30-inch sphere
                        had now been reduced to a 20-inch sphere, this was still larger than the
                        “size of the basketball” which had been mentioned when <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5520 had first been considered by the
                        Council. The President confessed that he was much annoyed by this tendency
                        to “gold-plate” the satellite in terms of instrumentation before we had
                        proved the basic feasibility of orbiting any kind of earth satellite.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added the comment
                        that irrespective of the merit of the earth satellite program, this program
                        had too many promoters and no bankers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> alluded to a suggestion
                        that if we succeeded in orbiting one of the test vehicles which would have
                        no scientific instrumentation, it might be possible to abandon the rest of
                        the program for launching the fully-instrumented scientific satellite. The
                        trouble with this reasoning, according to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1"
                            >Cutler</persName>, was that the six instrumented satellites were
                        already in the pipeline. Accordingly, if we abandoned the attempt to launch
                        these satellites, we wouldn’t save very much money and we would miss
                        achieving our objectives.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired what was
                        expected to happen if and when we succeeded in orbiting an earth satellite.
                        Would we not then initiate another tremendous program to launch additional
                        satellites and secure additional information about outer space. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that this was
                        the likely eventuality, and that this was the American way of doing
                        everything—bigger and better.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that it was quite conceivable that the information we
                        achieved from the successful launching of an earth satellite would be so
                        great as to merit a continuing program thereafter. The trouble was that our
                        original “basketball” satellite program had grown bigger, better, and more
                        costly, at the same time that everybody wished to duck financial
                        responsibility for its completion.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that there was
                        another significant factor to account for the increasing costs of programs
                        such as this. Whenever you put a time limit on a new and large scientific
                        program, you <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0779"/>immediately
                        encountered financial troubles. The costs were bound to rise if the
                        objective had to be achieved when a specific and relatively short time
                        interval was set.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that in any event he did not see how the United States
                        could back out of the earth satellite program at this time. We should,
                        however, keep it on no more elaborate a basis than at the present time.
                        Beyond this there was the problem of how to finance the completion of the
                        program. In this respect the President suggested that in view of the fact
                        that we have run out of money, there was no other recourse than for Defense
                        and the National Science Foundation jointly to appear before the
                        Congressional committees, tell them the story, and ask for supplemental
                        funds. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> agreed with
                        the President that we could not now abandon the program, and the President
                        informed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, Mr.
                        Brundage and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> that they
                        should make arrangements to go before the Congressional committees with a
                        request for funds to finance the program on its present basis. Before doing
                        so, however, the President said he wished the scientists who had been
                        concerned with this program to take another hard look at it to see if there
                        were any ways by which the costs could be cut or minimized. The President
                        said he was not hopeful in this respect, but that it was worth a try.
                        Thereafter the whole truth should be presented to the committees of
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> said he assumed that the
                        President wished Defense and NSF to make their joint presentation to the
                        same committees of Congress which had been dealing with the earth satellite
                        program in the past. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> also
                        suggested that the President would wish an immediate report to the National
                        Security Council as soon as the Defense Department has succeeded in orbiting
                        a test vehicle.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brundage pointed out that the President’s decisions would also involve
                        the use of $5.8 million more of the emergency funds of the Department of
                        Defense. The President agreed, and again called for a report by the Defense
                        Department scientists as to what could be saved if these scientists were a
                        little more restricted in their hopes and ambitions for the earth satellite
                        program. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented
                        that at least such a review by the scientists might help to prevent a
                        further elaboration of the earth satellite program.</p>

                    <p>On October 4, the Soviet Union launched the world’s first orbiting earth
                        satellite, designated “Sputnik I.” The satellite weighed 184 pounds, or
                        eight times as much as the proposed United States satellite, and orbited the
                        earth once every 88 minutes. Radio signals from the Soviet satellite were
                        picked up by United States Navy tracking stations within moments after
                        Sputnik reached orbit. The Soviet Government announced the achievement the
                        same day.</p>

                        <item>Apparently the thrust of the rocket used by the Russians to put up
                            their Satellite was around 200,000. The thrust of our rockets runs from
                            27,000 (Navy) up to 150,000 at present. It is believed that the Russian
                            rocket was the one used in their August rocket tests. <persName

                            sent up a rocket within a year 6/700 miles in the air. Its speed was
                            much lower than the speed of the rocket used by the Russians—probably
                            mach 12 at the peak, with a very much lower speed at the top of the
                            trajectory.</item>

                        <item>According to the newspapers, the Russians have offered to take up some
                            of our instrumentation in the next Satellite launched. This will pose a
                            very difficult problem for us as we do not think they know how to make
                            some of the very delicate material which we will include in our
                            Satellite. Apparently, our scientists believe the present Russian
                            Satellite is far more crude and less instrumented than what we have in

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> explained the order in
                        which the various aspects of this item of the agenda would be presented to
                        the members of the Council. He then called on the Director of Central
                        Intelligence for a briefing on the Soviet earth satellite.</p>
                    <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> stated that … on
                        October 4 the Soviets had fired their earth satellite from the Tyura Tam
                        range. Its initial path followed the range, crossing approximately over the
                        range’s other end at Klyuchi. … after the successful orbiting of the earth
                        satellite and after the second circuit of the earth by the satellite, the
                        Soviets announced their achievement. This delay in the announcement was in
                        line with the previous statements of the Soviet Union that they would not
                        announce an attempt to orbit their satellite until they had been assured
                        that the orbiting had been successful. …</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then turned to the world
                        reaction to the Soviet achievement. He first pointed out that <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had moved all his propaganda
                        guns into place. The launching of an earth satellite was one of a trilogy of
                        propaganda moves, the other two being the announcement of the successful
                        testing of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and the recent test of a
                        large-scale hydrogen bomb at Novaya Zemlya… .</p>
                    <p>Larded in with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s propaganda
                        statements had been a number of interesting remarks, such as the one in
                        which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> consigned military
                        aircraft to museums in the future. With respect to this remark, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that U.S.
                        intelligence had not observed as many Soviet heavy bombers on airfields as
                        had been expected. This raised the question as to whether the Soviets are in
                        the process of de-emphasizing the role of the heavy bomber. There had been
                        no clear verdict yet by the intelligence community on this question.</p>
                    <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0784"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> thought that there was no
                        doubt that in gearing up all this propaganda of recent days and weeks, the
                        Soviets had had an eye to the situation in the Middle East, and wished to
                        exert the maximum influence they could summon on that situation. Much of the
                        Soviet propaganda comment is following closely the original Soviet boast
                        relating their scientific accomplishments to the effectiveness of the
                        Communist social system. The target for this particular thrust, thought Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, was evidently the
                        underdeveloped nations in the world. He informed members of the Council that
                        he had copies of an FBIS <note n="3" xml:id="d348fn3">Foreign Broadcast
                            Information Service of the Central Intelligence Agency; it monitored
                            foreign broadcasts and summarized them in digest form, circulating the
                            summaries daily to various agencies and offices of the U.S.
                            Government.</note> summary of Soviet comment, which were available to
                        any who wished to have them.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Communist reaction was to declare quickly that the launching of
                        the earth satellite was proof of Soviet military and scientific supremacy
                        over the United States. Maximum play on this theme was being provided in all
                        the Soviet satellites.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> touched on the
                        reactions in Western Europe, in Asia, and in Africa. He concluded his
                        remarks by emphasizing that the Soviet Union was making a major propaganda
                        effort which was exerting a very wide and deep impact.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>’
                        briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> asked Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> to speak. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> began by stating that
                        much of what he was going to say would be familiar to the President and
                        other members of the Council. The President quipped that this was indeed the
                        case, and he was beginning to feel somewhat numb on the subject of the earth
                        satellite. Thereafter, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                            >Quarles</persName> outlined briefly the development of satellite
                        programs beginning with the period of World War II. The possibilities of a
                        satellite had been picked up first in this country by the Air Force, because
                        of its interest in the possibilities of a reconnaissance satellite. The
                        birth of the earth satellite program occurred in Rome, at the <gloss
                            target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> meeting of 1954. The President had
                        announced in 1955 the nature of the U.S. earth satellite program, in which
                        he had stressed the supremacy of scientific objectives.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> went on to point out
                        that our American scientists had recommended adoption of the proposal of the
                        Navy Department which had come to be known since as Project Vanguard. He
                        also pointed out the qualification that the U.S. earth satellite program was
                        not to interfere with the high priority of ballistic missiles programs of
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> thought it quite
                        proper to emphasize the paramount scientific aspect of the U.S. earth
                        satellite program. Our <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0785"/>Government
                        had never regarded this program as including as a major objective that the
                        United States should launch an earth satellite first, though, of course, we
                        have always been aware of the cold war implications of the launching of the
                        first earth satellite.</p>
                    <p>Another of our objectives in the earth satellite program was to establish the
                        principle of the freedom of outer space—that is, the international rather
                        than the national character of outer space. In this respect the Soviets have
                        now proved very helpful. Their earth satellite has overflown practically
                        every nation on earth, and there have thus far been no protests.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the military implications, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                            >Quarles</persName> pointed out that the U.S. program had used separate
                        rockets from the rockets employed in the program to achieve military
                        ballistic missiles. The evidence was to the contrary in the Soviet Union,
                        where the earth satellite program had always been integrated into the
                        military ballistic programs of the Soviet Union. Moreover, there was clear
                        evidence that the Soviets had embarked on their earth satellite program with
                        a prime objective of being the first nation to orbit an earth satellite.
                        They have now offered to cooperate with the United States and permit us to
                        place our own instrumentation in one of their satellites. Our disposition is
                        to find a good reason to refuse this offer. Since our own instrumentation is
                        better and more elaborate than theirs, we would stand to lose more than we
                        would gain by accepting their offer.</p>
                    <p>As to the implications of the Soviet achievement, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said he would not comment on the
                        cold war aspects, since they had been dealt with by the Director of Central
                        Intelligence. Beyond this, it was clear that the Soviets possess a
                        competence in long-range rocketry and in auxiliary fields which is even more
                        advanced than the competence with which we had credited them; although, of
                        course, we had always given them the capability of orbiting an earth
                        satellite. Finally, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                            >Quarles</persName>, the outer space implications of the launching of
                        this satellite were of very great significance, especially in relation to
                        the development of reconnaissance satellites.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                        >Quarles</persName>’ presentation, the President stated that he had one or
                        two questions. Pointing out that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                            >Quarles</persName> had said that the U.S. satellite would orbit the
                        earth at a lower height than the Soviet satellite, the President wanted to
                        know whether our satellite would not, as a result, encounter more
                        interference. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>
                        replied that perhaps our satellite for this reason would not last as long as
                        the Soviet satellite. The President then asked whether the result of this
                        would not affect U.S. prestige. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                            >Quarles</persName> replied that to counter the fact that our satellite
                        might not last so long, would be the advantage <pb n="760" xml:id="pg_760"
                            facs="0786"/>that our satellite would contain more refined equipment, as
                        a result of which we would learn more from our satellites than could be
                        learned from the Soviet satellites.</p>
                    <p>The President then said that he had one other question. He said that he had
                        read in a newspaper lately that two so-called intelligence people in the
                        United States had claimed that the Soviet satellite was actually taking
                        photographs of the United States for the use of the Soviet Union. People in
                        the Defense Department had said that this was not so and could not be done.
                        Who precisely, therefore, was doing this kind of talking? Where does such
                        talk come from? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>
                        replied that he did not know the two individuals in question, and would
                        probably never find out who they were. Nevertheless, he doubted the truth of
                        any such rumors, though we could not know for certain that the Soviet earth
                        satellite could not take pictures. In any case, he couldn’t conceive of
                        anyone in the know making such an allegation as this which, to the best of
                        his belief, was groundless.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President inquired of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                            >Quarles</persName> whether it was still part of our own U.S. plans
                        that, when we orbit our own satellite, the information obtained from it will
                        be made available to all interested people in all countries. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied in the
                        affirmative, and the Vice President commented that it would be a great
                        propaganda advantage for the United States to give out such information.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> then suggested that
                        the Council might like to hear from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1"
                            >Waterman</persName> or perhaps from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDJP1"
                            >Hagen</persName> (head of Project Vanguard). Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> referred to the President’s
                        earlier question as to the range to which we should attempt to send our own
                        earth satellite. We would know better the answer to this question when we
                        have received the full information from the Soviet earth satellite. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName> then suggested that Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HDJP1">Hagen</persName> comment to the Council on
                        the present status of our own and of the Soviet satellite program.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDJP1">Hagen</persName> read a report to the
                        Council on this subject. Among other things, he noted that the average
                        height of the Soviet satellite above the earth was 370 miles. Its closest
                        point to the earth in its elliptical orbit was about 200 miles; its furthest
                        point from the earth about 500 miles. While it was still unsafe to predict
                        how long the Soviet satellite would remain in orbit, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HDJP1">Hagen</persName> thought it might be only for a few
                        weeks.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDJP1">Hagen</persName> gave a brief
                        outline of the objectives and status of the U.S. earth satellite program.
                        One earth satellite had actually been completed. Three others were in
                        various stages of completion. The first 3-stage test vehicle had been
                        shipped to Florida yesterday for testing in December.</p>
                    <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0787"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> then called on Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>, who stressed the fact
                        that the United States had two very important assets in our rivalry with the
                        Soviet Union. First, we have been very open and above-board as to what we
                        will do in our program, as the Russians have not been. Secondly, we have had
                        very great experience and possess very great skill in designing the
                        scientific things that these satellites can do. We think we are ahead of the
                        Russians in this area, and that our satellites will provide us with very
                        sophisticated observations. Looking ahead, continued Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>, we ought to consider two
                        significant matters. In the first place, we want to produce a satellite
                        which can either return to the earth undamaged or which at least can send
                        undamaged material back to the earth. Secondly, we must consider the
                        possibility of satellites or space platforms which orbit the earth
                        indefinitely and keep sending back information. Finally, said Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>, there was a moral to take to
                        heart. This satellite problem was a typical marriage of science with
                        engineering, and the strength of our U.S. technology depends upon this
                        marriage.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> then called on Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BDDW1">Bronk</persName>, who stated initially that
                        there was one thing about which he was very greatly concerned— that is, that
                        we avoid getting our whole scientific community into a race to accomplish
                        everything before the Russians do. He therefore thought we should adhere
                        strictly to our stated earth satellite program and not be deflected from our
                        course merely by the fact that the Russians had been the first to launch an
                        earth satellite.</p>
                    <p>The President pointed out that all those around the table and others could
                        anticipate before very long being obliged to testify before Congressional
                        committees, to talk to the press, and the like. In the circumstances, he
                        could imagine nothing more important than that anybody so involved should
                        stand firmly by the existing earth satellite program which was, after all,
                        adopted by the Council after due deliberation as a reasonable program. In
                        short, we should answer inquiries by stating that we have a plan—a good
                        plan—and that we are going to stick to it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> then called on Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> for an appraisal of the
                        foreign policy implications for U.S. security of the successful launching of
                        the Soviet satellite. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                            >Herter</persName> initially stated that it was extremely difficult to
                        make such an assessment because there was such a mass of information pouring
                        into the Department of State. While there had been insufficient time to
                        analyze this intake, there were already some indications of the serious
                        effects of the Soviet success which we hope to be able to counteract.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> read
                        selected quotations to illustrate his point, with particular reference to
                        Turkey, Morocco, and the Philippines. He also pointed out the probable
                        repercussions of the Soviet success in the United Nations. The United States
                        may now <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0788"/>encounter much greater
                        difficulty in defending its disarmament position.</p>
                    <p>By and large, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                            >Herter</persName>, the reaction of our allies had been pretty firm and
                        good, though even the best of them require assurance that we have not been
                        surpassed scientifically and militarily by the USSR. The neutralist
                        countries are chiefly engaged in patting themselves on the back and
                        insisting that the Soviet feat proves the value and the wisdom of the
                        neutralism which these countries have adopted.</p>
                    <p>Summing up, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> described
                        the first foreign policy reactions as “pretty somber”. The United States
                        will have to do a great deal to counteract them and, particularly, to
                        confirm the existence of our own real military and scientific strength.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> enlarged somewhat on
                        the repercussions in the United Nations. He believed it was yet too soon to
                        measure these repercussions with any assurance, but already the first
                        surprise was settling down and the diplomats in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> have begun to realize that the fundamentals of the world
                        situation have not been changed—namely, that the capability for mutual
                        annihilation still exists. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                            >Stassen</persName> doubted whether there would be any quick shifts
                        among <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> then called on Mr.
                            Larson,<note n="4" xml:id="d348fn4"><persName>Arthur</persName> Larson,
                            Director of the U.S. Information Agency.</note> who said that he was
                        hesitant to say what he was going to say because he was not sure that he
                        really believed it. He then went on to say that while we could not permit
                        ourselves to be panicked by the Soviet achievement, he did wonder whether
                        our U.S. plans were now adequate with regard to the next great
                        break-through. If we lose repeatedly to the Russians as we have lost with
                        the earth satellite, the accumulated damage would be tremendous. We should
                        accordingly plan, ourselves, to accomplish some of the next great
                        break-throughs first—for example, the achievement of a manned satellite, or
                        getting to the moon. Do we have any such plans, asked Mr. Larson. If not,
                        our people should begin to think about them.</p>
                    <p>The President replied to Mr. Larson by stating that while he could hardly
                        quarrel with Mr. Larson’s conclusions if the Soviets were to win every time,
                        the fact remained that the United States couldn’t possibly set up a whole
                        vast scientific program of basic research in areas about which we don’t know
                        anything, and then attempt to outdo the Russians in each aspect of such a
                        program. We must, above all, still seek a military posture that the Russians
                        will respect.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President inquired of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                            Dulles</persName> whether it was possible to provide estimates of the
                        amounts of money allocated to <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0789"/>basic
                        research by the United States in comparison with the USSR. [Name
                        deleted]answering for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>,
                        could not give a clear response, though he could not say that the Russians
                        had put in more resources than we have. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                            >Dulles</persName> said that at least the Soviets have concentrated more
                        heavily on the guided missiles field than we have, ever since 1945. The
                        President, agreeing with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>,
                        pointed out that the United States had not made any all-out effort in the
                        field of ballistic missiles until after the <persName corresp="#p_KDJRJ1"
                            >Killian</persName> Committee had submitted its report to the National
                        Security Council.<note n="5" xml:id="d348fn5">Reference is to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KDJRJ1">Killian</persName> report of February 14, 1955,
                            not printed.</note> He added that of course the Soviets were bound to be
                        ahead of the United States in certain fields and in certain discoveries.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President warned the Council that we must be prepared for the fact
                        that Congress would insist on examining in great detail what we have been
                        doing in the missiles field. In the course of such an examination they are
                        certain to ask the question which he had just put—as to the relative amounts
                        which the United States and the USSR had allocated to their respective
                        missiles programs. Accordingly, we must be prepared to answer such a
                        question.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. Larson had reiterated his plea for planning for a U.S. win in the
                        next great break-through, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BDDW1">Bronk</persName>
                        commented that, in line with Mr. Larson’s views, the United States could, if
                        it chose, give much greater emphasis to the spectacular achievements that we
                        have made in the scientific field—for example, we could stress our vast
                        achievements in the field of cancer research. Regrettably, it was hard to
                        get the press to take an interest in these achievements. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName> suggested that we might perhaps have
                        announced the successful launching of a U.S. missile with a range of 3500
                        miles. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> pointed out
                        that the Operations Coordinating Board was presently engaged in examining
                        our public relations policies with respect to our missiles programs. General
                        Twining cautioned that we should not permit ourselves to become hysterical
                        about the Soviet achievement.</p>

                    <p>Although recent Council action has not reflected a similar expression by the
                        President with reference to the U.S. scientific satellite, the President’s
                        concern in this regard is no less clear. As you know, the President issued a
                        statement to the press on October 9<note n="3" xml:id="d349fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d347fn3">footnote 3, Document 347</ref>.</note> that the
                        first satellite test vehicle was planned to be launched in December, and
                        that the first fully instrumented satellite vehicle would be launched in
                        March, 1958.</p>
                    <p>In line with this statement the President said yesterday that he wanted to be
                        sure that the launching of the U.S. scientific satellite proceed as planned
                        and scheduled. He is, of course, conscious of the understandable desire of
                        the scientists to perfect the instrumentation that goes into the satellite.
                        Nevertheless, he made very plain that any efforts further to perfect such
                        scientific instrumentation should not be permitted to delay the planned
                        launching schedule.</p>
                    <p>In order that there might be no ambiguity, I thought it advisable to send
                        this memorandum to you as head of the responsible executive agency, with a
                        copy to the Director of the National Science Foundation.<note n="4"

                            planned to be launched in December and a fully instrumented satellite in
                            March 1958. The statement has been widely—though erroneously—interpreted
                            in the press and within the administration as a commitment to achieve
                            satellites on those dates. There is in fact only a probability—not a
                            certainty—that satellites will be achieved on these first

                            increased priority and fiscal and facilities support, but it appears
                            that no actions in these areas can now positively assure meeting the
                            dates of the White House release. We will certainly do everything we can

                    <p>Your memorandum of 22 October expressed concern that the Presidential
                        statement of 9 October on the U.S. satellite program has committed the Navy
                        to meet the December 1957 launching of a test vehicle and a March 1958
                        launching of an instrumented satellite.</p>
                    <p>Subsequent to the above, I have received a confirmation from the President
                        that he expects the Department of Defense to meet these commitments.</p>
                    <p>At the time the U.S. satellite program responsibility was assigned to the
                        Navy, the atmosphere of a completely scientific effort in the framework of
                        the International Geophysical Year prevailed. The Soviet’s success with
                        their satellite has changed the situation. We now have the added burden of
                        not only launching a successful satellite but doing it as per our current
                        schedule. The psychological factors in this matter have obviously received a
                        new emphasis. If necessary, a back-up program to insure success will be
                        initiated.</p>
                    <p>We must, therefore, go forward with deliberate speed in this program and meet
                        the above dates if at all possible.</p>
                    <p>Requests for assistance to maintain this schedule should be called to the
                        attention of the Assistant for Guided Missiles. We are attempting to obtain
                        an additional launching stand for you.</p>

                            designated “Sputnik II,” was launched on November 3, 1957. Considerably
                            larger than Sputnik I, this second Soviet satellite carried a dog—the

                                rend="italic">4</hi>], Soviet propaganda emphasized the satellite’s
                            scientific aspects but relied for the most part on free world sources to
                            bring home its military implications. The rest of the Bloc elaborated
                            both themes in volume. The second launching produced a smaller volume of
                            propaganda along similar lines.</item>

                        <item>Outside the Bloc, Sputnik I tended to remove misconceptions about
                            Soviet technological capabilities and to confirm its temporary <gloss

                            concern was deepened by Sputnik II, which caused many to believe that
                            the gap between the US and the USSR was wider than first realized.
                            Although these views were tempered by the general belief that the US
                            will match the USSR achievement in reasonable time, Sputnik II raised at
                            least some doubts as to US ability to catch up quickly.</item>

                        <item>The USSR’s prestige has risen substantially and the US has suffered a
                            serious, although not decisive, setback. World opinion tends to hold
                            that the sputniks per se have not altered the strategic balance of
                            forces in the short run, since Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"

                            Nevertheless, some new weight has been lent to Soviet foreign policy
                            pronouncements and increased credibility may attach to Soviet claims in

                            this has led to the conviction that NATO efforts must be strengthened,

                            political opportunities at less risk, and will exploit any sign of US

                            some time to come. In Europe, pressure for increased US, US-UK and NATO
                            effort and collaboration will continue. At the same time, further
                            stimulus will have been given to development of European advanced weapon
                            capability, partly because of continuing anxiety that the US may

                            will be influenced by progress in the weapons race. The status of US

                    <p>Growing out of the discussion of the previous item, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he was about to be obliged
                        to leave the meeting, and before doing so he had a word to say about the
                        postponement yesterday of our attempt to launch our first scientific
                        satellite. He earnestly hoped that in the future we would not announce the
                        date, the hour, and indeed the minute, that we were proposing to launch our
                        earth satellite, until the satellite was successfully in orbit. Speaking
                        very earnestly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said
                        the effect of the publicity of the last few days, culminating in the final
                        decision to postpone the attempt to launch our first earth satellite, had
                        had a terrible effect on the foreign relations of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that he was all for stopping such unfortunate
                        publicity, but he had no idea how we could stop it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> then undertook to
                        explain what had happened yesterday. He stated that we were, in a sense,
                        hoist by our own petard. We had in our earth satellite program dedicated
                        ourselves <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0798"/>from the beginning to
                        work upon this program as a scientific experiment. We had accordingly
                        promised the <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> scientists throughout the
                        world that we would inform them when we proposed to try to launch our earth
                        satellite and to give them all the desired information about it. It is too
                        bad that yesterday’s test had to be postponed, but we had promised the
                        scientists of the world to inform them when we made our attempt to launch
                        the satellite, so that they could all be ready at their various stations to
                        receive the scientific data coming from the earth satellite. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said that these remarks
                        constituted not an excuse, but an explanation.</p>
                    <p>Still speaking feelingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >Dulles</persName> asked whether we could not possibly avoid further
                        announcements of launchings until we were assured that they were successful.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that we
                        could only do so by changing our policy with respect to the fundamental
                        purposes of our scientific satellite program. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that what had happened
                        yesterday had been a disaster for the United States.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired whether the scientists of the world would lose very
                        much significant data if they were unaware that the United States had
                        actually successfully launched a scientific satellite until it had orbited
                        the world at least once.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KDJRJ1">Killian</persName> likewise inquired
                        whether, in our next try to launch a satellite, we could not assure
                        ourselves of its successful orbiting before we notified the world that we
                        were attempting to launch such a satellite.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired whether what had happened at the Florida grounds
                        yesterday constituted a failure to launch the scientific satellite.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that it had
                        not been a failure, but that a delay had occurred in the course of the
                        countdown. The President then went on to inquire whether there were not
                        other launching sites available for the earth satellite. Couldn’t we launch
                        our satellite from some desert region rather than from the thickly-populated
                        Florida coast? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>
                        replied that while it might well be desirable to have additional launching
                        sites for the earth satellite, none had been prepared. The President then
                        inquired whether it was not possible to shield the activities and the
                        installations from which the satellite would be launched. Could not
                        something be done so that not everyone within miles of the Florida base
                        could see the rocket?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> continued to express
                        his irritation at our practice of giving out such precise announcements of
                        the days, hours, and minutes of our launching attempts. What had happened
                        yesterday had made us the laughing-stock of the whole Free World, and was
                        being most effectively exploited by the Soviets. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> again replied that our announcement
                        policy had been drawn <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0799"/>up in terms
                        of a certain philosophy about our scientific satellite program. Perhaps we
                        should change this philosophy.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KDJRJ1">Killian</persName> then suggested that he
                        and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>, together with
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BDDW1">Bronk</persName> and Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_WAT1">Waterman</persName>, should sit down and try to figure
                        out how best to deal with the timing of our announcements of attempts to
                        launch our earth satellites.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Allen</persName> stated that from the point of view of the U.S.

                            <p>“At the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> luncheon there was
                                extended discussion of the publicity connected with the attempt to
                                launch an earth satellite at Cape Canaveral, Florida. There was
                                general agreement that the extensive and sensational news stories
                                were having an extremely deleterious impact throughout the world.
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> remarked that the
                                psychologic beating which the U.S. took because of the launching of
                                Sputnik was being exceeded by the beating the U.S. is suffering
                                because of the publicized fizzle in Florida. The fact that papers
                                throughout the U.S. were carrying official U.S. Navy photographs of
                                arrangements for the launching was mentioned, as were the facilities
                                being accorded to the press at the launching site. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said that the Department of
                                Defense had been under great pressure from the press, which had
                                adopted an attitude that delay or failure in the launching was
                                impossible. Further, the press felt that it was entitled to full
                                coverage irrespective of the possible impact overseas.</p>
                            <p>“Later, General <persName corresp="#p_CRL1">Cutler</persName>
                                expressed strong views that the proposal to name U.S. satellites
                                after scientists was inadvisable. He felt that the use of names
                                would be misunderstood and would make the U.S. vulnerable to
                                propaganda attacks. Names might mean one thing in English and to the
                                West, but might mean something quite different in other languages
                                and areas. Nationality, racial and religious complications were
                                foreseen. There was general agreement by the Board that efforts
                                should be made to stop the proposed use of the name ’Goddard’ for
                                the first satellite and that the whole policy of giving names to
                                satellites should be reviewed.</p>

                    <p>The Director of Guided Missiles has provided the following preliminary report
                        concerning today’s unsuccessful Vanguard firing: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The countdown for the TV–3 Vanguard launching on 6 December 1957 was
                                quite normal after an early hold near the beginning of the count.
                                All components appeared to be working correctly. At 1145 countdown
                                was completed and the vehicle lifted off the stand. After two
                                seconds, it settled back on the pad apparently due to loss of thrust
                                in the first stage motor. It fell over and burst into flames. Both
                                the first and second stages were destroyed and the third stage was
                                thrown clear without igniting.</p>
                            <p>“A preliminary study of the instrumentation records by the Naval
                                Research Laboratory personnel has been made, and at last report the
                                cause of the accident had not been ascertained with certainty. For
                                safety reasons, a close inspection of the vehicle and launching pad
                                had not been completed at last report. As far as yet determined,
                                there has been only limited damage to the launching pad. No
                                personnel were injured.</p>
                            <p>“Unless more substantial damage to the launching pad is discovered in
                                further inspection, the back-up TV–3 vehicle will be mounted on it
                                and should be ready for launching before the end of the calendar
                                year. Barring unforeseen delays, the Navy still expects to adhere to
                                its previous launching schedules for the full scale satellite.”</p>

                            <p>“At the meeting on December 11, there was extended discussion of
                                publicity on the recent test at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Mr. Murray
                                Snyder (Defense) and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_WAT1">Alan T.
                                    Waterman</persName> (National Science Foundation) were present
                                for this item. Mr. Snyder told the Board of the experiences of
                                Defense in handling publicity at Cape Canaveral. He pointed out the
                                physical limitations on controlling the press at the launching site,
                                as well as the policy considerations if additional restrictions were
                                to be attempted. In the first place, the recent Vanguard test was,
                                as had been made clear, purely scientific in nature. It was well
                                established policy to permit full press coverage of such scientific
                                projects. Furthermore, it was impossible to control speculation by
                                the press. Even more damaging stories would be published if less
                                factual information was given out. To keep people away from the
                                launching site would require some Presidential action similar to
                                that at the time of the Manhattan project and this would create
                                great public relations problems. As for the future, Mr. Snyder
                                suggested certain changes in the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>
                                Guide Lines, the principal point being that all official releases
                                should emanate from his office in the Pentagon.</p>
                            <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that official
                                releases were only a small part of the picture. It was the
                                speculative stories which did the damage. Perhaps these could be
                                best controlled through appropriate official releases. At the same
                                time, the Guide Lines for the Pentagon spokesmen should not be
                                inflexible.</p>
                            <p>“Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that
                                every effort should be made to keep attempted launchings secret
                                until a satellite was actually in orbit. It seemed essential to him
                                that one man should be in charge of all releases and that this man
                                should operate under clear directives. <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779"
                                    facs="0805"/>As a matter of policy, releases should underrate
                                the possibility of success rather than give exaggerated opinions of
                                the possibility of success. He said that ‘U.S. prestige should not
                                ride on expectations as tenuous as the doubtful success of
                                Vanguard’.</p>
                            <p>“Mr. <persName>Allen</persName> (<gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                                    >USIA</gloss>) said the recent failure of the test had subjected
                                the U.S. to damaging ridicule overseas. Our position at the moment
                                was undignified and damaging and reflected a dangerous lack of
                                discipline. One trouble was that the Guide Lines were directed
                                toward a purely scientific experiment. Since the Russian <gloss
                                    target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> announcement and the successful
                                launching of Sputnik it was no longer possible to treat the tests in
                                this light. Rather, they had become a part of psychologic warfare
                                and competition.</p>
                            <p>“It was agreed that the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Guide
                                Lines should be amended along the lines suggested by Mr. Snyder.
                                However, the actual language should be refined and submitted to the
                                Board for approval in approximately two weeks’ time.”</p>

                        <item>Against this background, it is especially important now and in the

                            effectively conveys the idea that America and the free world are united
                            and strong—militarily, politically, economically and morally—but that at
                            the same time we are proceeding solidly to increase and consolidate that
                            strength in ways that will improve free world security and decrease the
                            danger of war. Such a framework should allow us to put specific US and

                            a perspective that effectively contributes to the total picture of free

                        Strength</hi></p>
                    <p>In his November 7 address, the President said that the recent Soviet
                        scientific accomplishments “have provided us all with renewed evidence of
                        Soviet competence in science and techniques important to modern warfare.” He
                        also pointed out the critical problem posed for us in the future by the
                        heavy emphasis the Soviets have been placing on training of scientists and
                        engineers.</p>
                    <p>To meet the situation posed by these facts, the US is taking specific steps
                        to strengthen scientific education and basic research, and is formulating
                        ways of improving the coordination and exchange of scientific information
                        with friendly countries. Such measures can be expected to contribute
                        substantially to increased free world security.</p>
                    <p>The recent Soviet scientific achievements have tended temporarily to obscure
                        the clear overall advantage the free world holds in most fields of science
                        and technology, including the broad range of peaceful scientific and
                        technological accomplishments that—in contrast with the Soviet system—have
                        resulted in direct material benefits to millions of people in every country.
                        To help exploit this advantage more fully, posts will be provided with an
                        increased flow of materials illustrating the high level and the humane and
                        diversified character of free world science as it has flourished under free
                        political and economic institutions.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">C. The Continuing Search for Peace</hi></p>
                    <p>Present emphasis on the effectiveness of the free world military posture and
                        the measures being taken to improve it should not be allowed to obscure the
                        overriding objective of US policy: the achievement of a secure and lasting
                        peace. As public opinion overseas begins to reflect on the rapid and
                        dramatic developments of recent months, there is likely to be a strong
                        resurgence of concern as to what lies beyond the apparently unending upward
                        spiral of armaments. Already in many areas the preoccupying question is not
                        “Who’s ahead in the arms race?” but rather “What are the prospects now for
                        war or peace?”</p>
                    <p>An indispensable element of our national posture, therefore, must be
                        sustained evidence of our active pursuit of peace and reduction of tensions.
                        We can point to an impressive recent history of US efforts for peace since
                        the end of World War II: our role in originating the United Nations, in
                        proposing control of atomic energy, in negotiating for disarmament, in
                        initiating the atoms–for–peace program and the International Atomic Energy
                        Agency, and in seeking settlement of outstanding political issues. But it is
                        even more important to emphasize that in spite of current Soviet
                        intransigeance, <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0808"/>the US and its
                        partners remain committed to the first-step disarmament measures proposed in
                        London last August for nuclear control, prevention of surprise attack,
                        suspension of tests, and reduction of armed forces and armaments. The
                        maintenance of the necessary deterrent military strength does not in any way
                        conflict with our efforts for peace; it supports these efforts by reducing
                        the possibility of aggression and providing the opportunity for continued
                        search for the peaceful settlement of differences and for a way out of the
                        nuclear dilemma.</p>
                    <p>The main thing is that the US and the free world should appear to be strong
                        and growing in strength in all departments, scientific, military, economic,
                        and this strength is dedicated to peace. The element of belligerence,
                        therefore, should never be allowed to enter into the statement of our
                        case.</p>

                    <p>During 1954–1958, the United States Government in general, and the Department
                        of State in particular, devoted substantial attention and energies to the

                        international scientific body, the International Council of Scientific
                        Unions (<gloss target="#t_ICSU1">ICSU</gloss>), a third Polar Year similar
                        to the Second Polar Year organized under the auspices of a number of
                        international scientific bodies in 1932–1933 to conduct coordinated
                        international scientific observations in the polar areas. The <gloss
                            target="#t_ICSU1">ICSU</gloss> Bureau, the eight-member executive body
                        of the Council, endorsed the <gloss target="#t_MCI1">MCI</gloss> plan in
                        January 1951 and in October of that year the <gloss target="#t_ICSU1"
                            >ICSU</gloss> Executive Board decided to create a special committee to
                        work on plans for a third Polar Year. In March 1952 the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICSU1">ICSU</gloss> Bureau named an eight-person committee to
                        study the matter in detail and invitations were issued to all nations
                        adhering to the <gloss target="#t_ICSU1">ICSU</gloss> to join the effort.
                        The Soviet Union was not a member of <gloss target="#t_ICSU1">ICSU</gloss>,
                        but later agreed to join the international effort in its capacity as member
                        of several subsidiary <gloss target="#t_ICSU1">ICSU</gloss>
                        organizations.</p>
                    <p>As more nations agreed to join the enterprise, objections were raised as to
                        confining scientific endeavors and observations to the polar regions and it
                        was proposed to name the forthcoming endeavor the International Geophysical
                        Year. The special eight-person committee named in March 1952 and now
                        somewhat enlarged met at Brussels from June 30 to July 3, 1953. Continuing
                        to represent international scientific unions rather than national groups,
                        this committee named itself the Comité Spécial de l’Année Géophysique
                        Internationale (<gloss target="#t_CSAGI1">CSAGI</gloss>) and it was chosen
                        to run the <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss>. May 1954 was set as the
                        deadline for the submission of detailed national programs for the dispatch
                        of expeditions and for observation. Thus, 2½ years lead time was available
                        before the beginning of the <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss>, <pb n="785"
                            xml:id="pg_785" facs="0811"/>which was scheduled to open on July 1,
                        1957, and run through December 1958 in order to take maximum advantage of
                        the period of expected peak sun spot activity and eclipses.</p>
                    <p>Although the <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> was concerned with numerous
                        scientific programs of planetary observation and evaluation including the
                        Arctic, the equatorial region, and three selected pole-to-pole meridians
                        along which a maximum number of tests and observations were conducted, the
                        chief foci of all efforts were Antarctica and the exploration of outer space
                        through the launching of various earth satellites by rocketry.
                        Considerations of space have precluded documentary treatment of the United
                        States Government’s strong interest and participation in all aspects of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> expressed chiefly through the
                        National Academy of Sciences and the Operations Coordinating Board and, in
                        lesser measure, through the Departments of State and Defense. However, a
                        number of Department of State files contain information concerning planning
                        and implementation of <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> projects plus
                        government reaction to Soviet <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss>
                        achievements, specifically the launching of the first Earth Satellite
                        (“Sputnik”). These files are: S/SA Files: Lot 61 D 333, filled with detailed
                        records of United States participation in the numerous <gloss
                            target="#t_CSAGI1">CSAGI</gloss> and regional scientific meetings during
                        the years 1955–1958; S/S–<gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Files: Lot 61 D
                        385, containing rich documentation on strategic and scientific planning and
                        implementation of various <gloss target="#t_IGY1">IGY</gloss> projects in
                        which the United States participated; P/PG Files: Lot 60 D 661, containing
                        information on the American Earth Satellite program; and Central Files, 031,
                        702.22 and 911.80, 81, and 82, concerned with scientific expeditions,
                        Antarctica, and general scientific subjects, respectively.</p>
