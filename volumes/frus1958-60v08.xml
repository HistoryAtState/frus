<head>Preface</head>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately adopted.</p>
<p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series were promulgated by Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RSF1">Frank</persName> B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. A statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by Title IV of the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351 <hi rend="italic">et seq</hi>.), added by Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991.</p>
<p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government, including facts which contributed to the formulation of policies and records providing supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately adopted.</p>
<p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events recorded.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_IV" n="IV" facs="0004"/>
<p>The volume presented here, compiled in 1981 and 1982, meets all the standards of selection and editing prevailing in the Department of State at that time. This volume records policies and events of more than 30 years ago, but the statute allows the Department until 1996 to reach the 30-year line in the publication of the series.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
<p>This volume is part of a triennial subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of the final 3 years (1958–1960) of the administration of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>. This subseries comprises 19 print volumes totaling more than 15,000 pages and 7 microfiche supplements presenting more than 14,000 additional pages of original documents.</p>
<p>In planning and preparing this 1958–1960 triennium of volumes, the editors chose to present the official record of U.S. foreign affairs with respect to Europe, the Soviet Union, and Canada in five print volumes. Volume VIII presents the record of U.S. policy during the first part of the Berlin crisis through the end of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Meeting in August 1959; Volume VII (in two parts) documents <hi rend="italic">US</hi>. policy on European economic and political integration, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, Canada, France, Italy, Portugal, Scandinavia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Vatican. Volume IX presents documents on U.S. policy toward Berlin following the Foreign Ministers Meeting with particular attention to the abortive summit conference in May 1960; U.S. relations with the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria; and U.S. policy toward the German Democratic Republic. Volume X (in two parts) documents policies toward Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, Finland, Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
<p>The original research, compilation, and editing of this volume were done in 1981 and 1982 under the Department regulation derived from Secretary Kellogg’s charter of 1925. This regulation prescribed that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include “a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy decisions within the range of the Department of State’s responsibilities,” presuming that the records of the Department of State would constitute the central core of documentation presented in the series. The Department of State historians have always had complete and unconditional access to all records and papers of the Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special decentralized (lot) files of the policymaking levels; the files of the Department of State’s Executive Secretariat, which included all the official papers created by or submitted to the Secretary of State; the files of all overseas Foreign Service posts and U.S. special missions; and the official correspondence with foreign governments and with other Federal agencies. Any failure to include a complete Department of State record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series <pb xml:id="pg_V" n="V" facs="0005"/>cannot be attributed to constraints or limitations placed upon the Department historians in their access to Department records, information security regulations and practices notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Secretary Kellogg’s charter of 1925 and Department regulations derived therefrom required that further records “needed to supplement the documentation in the Department files” be obtained from other government agencies. Department historians preparing the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes documenting the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration, including the editors of this volume, fully researched the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and other <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House foreign policy records. These Presidential papers have become a major part of the official record published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.</p>
<p>Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related documentation from other Federal agencies including the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency. All of this documentation has been routinely made available for use in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of these agencies and the cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration. Particular thanks are due to the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName> Presidential Library for its assistance in preparing this volume.</p>
<p>Department of State historians have also enjoyed steadily broadened access to the records of the Department of Defense, particularly the records of the Joints Chief of Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Selective access has been obtained to the records of several other agencies in order to supplement the official record in particular <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes.</p>
<p>Completion of the declassification of this volume and the final steps of its preparation for publication coincided with the development since early 1991 by the Central Intelligence Agency, in cooperation with the Department of State, of expanded access by Department historians to high-level intelligence documents from among those records still in the custody of that Agency. The Department of State chose not to postpone the publication of this volume to ascertain how such access might affect the scope of available documentation and the changes that might be made in the contents of this particular volume. The Department is, however, using this expanded access, as arranged by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s History Staff, for compilation of future volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.</p>
<p>The statute of October 28, 1991, requires that the published record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of all the major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. It further requires that government agencies, departments,and other entities of the United States Government cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing <pb xml:id="pg_VI" n="VI" facs="0006"/>full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. These new standards go beyond the mandate of the prior Department of State regulations for the preparation of the series and define broadened access to the records of other government agencies. The research and selection of documents for this volume were carried out in 1981–1982 in accordance with the existing Department regulations. The editors decided not to delay publication to conduct the additional research needed to meet the new standards, but they are confident that the manuscript prepared in 1981–1982 provides a fully accurate record.The List of Sources, pages XIII–XVII, identifies the particular files and collections used in the preparation of this volume.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Selection for Foreign Relations, 1958–1960, Volume VIII</p>
<p>In selecting documents for this volume, the editors placed primary consideration on the formulation of policy on the “German problem” by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and his top advisers. The selection also aimed at bringing together documentation on the most significant U.S. diplomatic exchanges with the Soviet Union regarding the status of Berlin. Memoranda of conversations among the President, the Secretary of State, and other top officials and the memoranda of discussion and policy papers of the National Security Council with respect to basic U.S. policies toward Germany and Berlin were the focus of foreign policy decision making in the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration. These papers have been presented here as fully as possible.</p>
<p>The editors had complete access to and made use of memoranda of discussion at National Security Council meetings and other institutional <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> documents included in the <persName corresp="#p_WAC1">Whitman</persName> File at the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName> Library, as well as more informal foreign policy materials in that file and in other collections at the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library. These Presidential files were supplemented by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House documents in Department of State files.</p>
<p>During the years 1958–1959, the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House and the Department of State worked together closely in the formulation of U.S. policy toward Berlin. Secretaries of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian A. Herter</persName> (after April 1959) advised President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and took part in the deliberations of the National Security Council, while the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House and National Security Council directed the preparation of contingency papers on Berlin that included input from other executive agencies. The Department of State prepared and coordinated exchanges of views and discussions of policy toward Berlin with the French, German, and British Governments and participated in meetings between President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and the leaders of these states.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_VII" n="VII" facs="0007"/>
<p>The editors have selected from the files of the Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House, and National Security Council records of the most important meetings between the President and his principal foreign policy advisers and between them and their counterparts in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. They have also included internal U.S. Government policy recommendations and decision papers relating to the question of Berlin; telegrams that document the important policy recommendations of U.S. representatives at the Missions in London, Bonn, Paris, Berlin, and Moscow; and the records of the several quadripartite working groups that prepared reports on Berlin.</p>
<p>In addition to Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House, and National Security Council records, the editors had access to a body of declassified <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> files at the National Archives and Records Administration. Copies of classified <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> materials were obtained from the Joint Staff on a request basis. The editors selected documents that indicated major foreign policy recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The editors reviewed records on U.S. military planning and dispositions in Germany and included the most significant of these.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
<p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Incoming telegrams from U.S. Missions are placed according to time of receipt in the Department of State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
<p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series follows office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Obvious typographical errors are corrected, but other mistakes and omissions in the source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source text that were omitted. The amount of material omitted because it was unrelated, however, is not accounted for. All ellipses and brackets that appear in the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
<p>The first unnumbered footnote to each document indicates the document’s source, original classification, distribution, and drafting information.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_VIII" n="VIII" facs="0008"/>
<p>The source footnote also provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been made to determine if a document has been previously published, and this information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
<p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources, provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes, describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from memoirs and other firsthand accounts have been used when appropriate to supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
<p>The initial declassification review of this volume in 1987 and there after resulted in the preliminary decision to withhold more than 15 percent of the documents originally selected primarily because of the continued sensitivity of the Berlin question. Following reunification of Germany, a second declassification review reduced the amount withheld to 4.7 percent of the documents. The remaining documentation provides a full account of the major foreign policy issues confronting, and the policies undertaken by, the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration on the question of Berlin.</p>
<p>The Division of Historical Documents Review of the Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy, and Classification Review, Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification review of the documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
<p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the following categories, and the disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security, requires classification:</p>
<list>
<item>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</item>
<item>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or plans relating to the national security;</item>
<item>3) foreign government information;</item>
<item>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence sources or methods;</item>
<item>5) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</item>
<item>6) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national security;</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_IX" n="IX" facs="0009"/>
<item>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</item>
<item>8) cryptology; or</item>
<item>9) a confidential source.</item>
</list>
<p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information, subject only to the current requirements of national security and law. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>

<head>January–October 1958: Continuing Soviet Harassment of Western Access to Berlin</head>
<div type="document" xml:id="d1" n="1">
<head>1. Telegram From the <gloss type="from">Embassy in Germany</gloss> to the <gloss type="to">Department of State</gloss><note n="0" xml:id="d1fn0" type="source">Source: Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/1–958. Confidential; Priority. Repeated to Berlin and Heidelberg.</note></head>
<dateline><placeName>Bonn</placeName>, <date when="1958-01-09T19:00:00">January 9, 1958, 7 p.m.</date></dateline>
<p>2100. Reference Department to Bonn 1709, December 27.<note n="1" xml:id="d1fn1">See <ref target="frus1955-57v26"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1955–1957, vol. XXVI</ref>, p. 530.</note> I believe it is time we looked at Berlin Allied access problems as a whole and evaluate actions and principles pertaining to land access in relation to air access and vice versa. The uninformed public might not draw a distinction between acceptance of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials at surface checkpoints and refusal to accept <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> traffic control in the corridors even though our air rights may be more solidly based on quadripartite agreements. Soviets have no physical control over movement of aircraft or of passengers, cargo and mail moving by air comparable to their ability to physically control other types of traffic. This fact is a limitation on their ability to harass West Berlin. Some Berliners and Federal Republic officials are concerned that we are not too sure of our air rights and might not maintain strong position on air access in face of Soviet attempts to restrict.</p>
<p>Even though we cannot anticipate nor be prepared for every possible Soviet move affecting access to Berlin, we must be prepared to deal quickly with any action impeding access and infringing upon our rights. While current policy provides for acceptance <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel at checkpoints as “agents” of Soviets, planning for contingencies has not gone beyond assumption that such personnel in this capacity would merely look at documents and pass train. While such might well be the case initially, we would certainly be naive to think this procedure would go no further. It is certain that since acceptance of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> “authority” by Western powers is underlying Soviet objective, continuous pressure to that end may be expected. The next step would logically and almost inevitably be demand for German translations, questioning status of travel, <pb xml:id="pg_2" n="2" facs="0027"/>challenging right to move German mail car, insistence on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> visas, etc. We can anticipate that protests to Soviets will encounter a referral to “sovereign” <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and we would reach an impasse. (While we are not predicting these events will occur, we would be remiss not to consider such assumptions in connection with policy planning.)</p>
<p>The above situation poses two problems:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) At what point beyond mere “showing” of documents is recognition of “authority” involved?</item>
<item>(2) What do we do when we turn back trains rather than recognize <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> “authority”? (Reference to “actual physical interference” in reference telegram not clear unless refusal to pass train considered physical interference.)</item>
</list>
<p>On the first problem, I feel that acceptance at <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> request of any condition or procedure not in effect with Soviets would constitute recognizing <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> “authority”. Furthermore, there would be no channel for developing a modus vivendi for keeping the trains running when minor questions arose as there has been with the Soviets. Department’s comments on this problem would be appreciated.</p>
<p>The second problem involves the “self-imposed blockade,” which raises visions of 1948 airlift, even though in assumed situation only consideration of Allied access (not German) involved. Our ability to take and hold a strong line with Soviets in this eventuality and to muster public opinion by dramatizing Soviets’ actions blocking our access to Berlin depends upon how long we can accept cessation of military train service and official use of autobahn. With this in mind, I asked <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss> to estimate what would be required to airlift military surface traffic and they have supplied the following information:</p>
<list>
<item>1. Temporary ground blockade of military supply routes (train and autobahn) could be accepted logistically for two to three weeks without serious inconvenience and without instigation of airlift transport other than normal air courier service plus lift for certain perishables.</item>
<item>2. Maintenance normal supply conditions in Berlin would require air transport for 4 tons dairy products and 7 tons <gloss target="#t_APO1">APO</gloss> mail daily. After first week, additional daily requirement 3 tons fresh fruits &amp; vegetables would exist. Translated into aircraft requirements: For first week, 2 C–54 or 2 C–119 or 1 C–124 daily; for second week, 2 C–54 or 3 C–119 or 1 C–124.</item>
<item>3. Present overall baggage, freight and U.S. mail daily average tonnage on passenger trains is 35 tons. As indicated 2 above, only 11 tons required for short period. In addition, about 50 tons of German mail carried daily in Bundespost mail cars into Berlin on military trains; similar amount carried on West bound runs.</item>
<item>4. Trains carry average of 80 passengers daily to Berlin of whom approximately 40 per cent duty travelers.</item>
<item>5. Passenger train service to and from Berlin costs U.S. $4,000 daily, not including cost of Bundespost mail cars. Paid by Berlin magistrate</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_3" n="3" facs="0028"/>
<item>funds. (In addition, the Bundespost contributes about $1,000 daily to the Bundesbahn for the continued operation of the Bremerhaven–Berlin passenger trains on a daily basis as per an agreement with <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss>.)</item>
<item>6. U.S. military freight shipments to Berlin, in addition to freight on passenger trains, averaged during last year 3,250 tons per month, of which 86 percent coal (15 tons per day other than coal). Such trains regularly scheduled semi-monthly, but last year actual average 7.5 trains per month.</item>
</list>
<p>On basis of above information, I am asking USAFE to explore capability of handling these movements by air on short notice. The operation of only one flight per day of one C–124 for 3 weeks would carry us through the critical period, and even more prolonged air movement would appear feasible. Department’s comments on this second problem would also be appreciated.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss> fully concurs desirability considering inter-relationship air &amp; ground access problems and review of principles to be followed in local actions.</p>

<p>775. Allied Political Advisers met with <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> at Karlshorst this afternoon. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> apologized for being unable to receive American Political Adviser yesterday, stating he had not had time to brief himself on subject which he assumed was purpose of visit.</p>
<p>British Chairman for month opened by stating political advisers had come to protest against unprecedented control measures which <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s had tried to impose on Allied military trains night of Jan 14–15.<note n="1" xml:id="d2fn1">On the night of January 14–15 U.S. military trains were held at the Marienborn checkpoint by Soviet officers who insisted that the movement orders of all passengers had to be stamped by them. Documentation on the incident is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221.</note> He <pb xml:id="pg_4" n="4" facs="0029"/>said that, after lengthy series of discussions with <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> new forms of documentation had been introduced by Allies in effort to eliminate difficulties which had been experienced at <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> checkpoints. This system had now been disturbed by <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> control officers who had tried to stamp movement orders of individual travelers on Allied trains. During all these previous discussions, <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> had never mentioned any desire on part of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s to stamp movement orders and, during some 12 years of operation of Allied military trains, no such stamps had been placed on documentation of travelers. Political Advisers therefore desired to register protest against this action and to request that instructions be issued that Allied trains be permitted to pass checkpoints in accordance with established procedures.</p>
<p>French and American Political Advisers endorsed statement of British Political Adviser. We added that we felt conduct of Soviet officers at checkpoint in obtaining movement orders by subterfuge from train commander of Berlin–Frankfurt train, and refusing to return them to him until they had all been stamped in checkpoint office, was undignified and should be protested.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> responded that reasons brought to his attention for Allied protest were insufficient and therefore he could not accept such protest. Before answering specifically, he would in turn like to lodge protest with Americans and British for violation of understanding reached during meeting of November 20 last year.<note n="2" xml:id="d2fn2"><persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> reported on this meeting in telegram 620, November 19, 1957, but indicated that it had taken place on November 19. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221/11–1957)</note> He claimed that at this meeting he had referred to fact that same procedure would apply to rail travel as for autobahn. He stated that one of aims of new procedure was to limit use of travel documentation for one single round-trip. It had appeared that this had been agreed. <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s had now observed that movement orders were being used for several trips on military trains by same person. Moreover, same movement order was being used by personnel initially traveling on autobahn and making return trip by military train. He cited case of American sgt who had arrived in Berlin on Jan 4 by autobahn and left Jan 14 by military train. He said there were many cases of American soldiers using orders issued with a period of validity of one month for numerous trips, and he did not think these facts could be denied. This was reason, <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> continued, why new measures of control had to be taken similar to those already in force on autobahn. He could only construe statements made by Political Advisers against these new measures of control as based on desire to continue such violations on American and British side.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_5" n="5" facs="0030"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> then launched obviously fabricated tirade against alleged rudeness and “hysterics” (displayed by American train commanders) on night Jan 14–15. He went into considerable detail regarding actions supposed to have taken place which he said “could only cause astonishment”. If in future, American train commander displayed such rudeness, he could not be permitted on train, and he (<persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName>) would request that he be relieved of duties. He noted that British and French trains had passed same evening without incident and with no notable loss of time. He then referred to conversation on Dec 11 between Soviet Colonel Safronov and American Colonels Forame and Baxter. During this meeting, he said, Col Safronov had drawn attention to violations of movement order procedures which <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s had noted, and had stated that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s intended to put into effect same procedures for rail travel as for autobahn.<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3"><persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> reported on this meeting in telegram 706, December 12, 1957. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221/12–1257)</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> continued that, on night of Jan 14–15, incidents occurred at checkpoint of kind which had never happened before. Only a technical matter was really involved which <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s considered came within scope of their authority to “control” travel between Berlin and West Germany. Therefore incidents were entirely fault of United States. In future <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s did not intend to permit any violation of rules, and he therefore requested that train commanders be appropriately instructed to permit observance of same procedures as at autobahn checkpoints, as well as to avoid rudeness. He recognized that some would be needed to permit proper dissemination of instructions and hence stamping of movement orders would go into effect on night Jan 31–Feb 1.</p>
<p>British Chairman responded that they in turn must decline to accept his protest, which could not be justified. He must repeat that Political Advisers were to ask for abandonment of Soviet attempt to propose new controls. He then asked specific question whether <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> was actually arguing that traveler could not proceed to Berlin by autobahn and then proceed to West Germany by military train on basis of same movement order. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> evaded direct answer, stating that movement order was issued for single round-trip. He then rhetorically asked whether there was any way to insure that movement order was not used for several trips except by placing stamp thereon to show movement order had previously been used.</p>
<p>He could not see what the objection was to stamping movement orders in the same manner as they were stamped at autobahn checkpoints.</p>
<p>To this British Political Adviser responded that point Allies were making was that an established procedure was being disturbed. For 12 <pb xml:id="pg_6" n="6" facs="0031"/>years <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s had not thought it necessary to stamp travel orders. Allies must, accordingly, request that these established procedures remain unchanged, and that new travel documentation continue to be treated in same way as between Dec 2, 1957 and Jan 13, 1958.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> once more said that he could not see what the objection was to stamping movement orders used on military trains, since we did not object to their being stamped for autobahn travel. Defending old system was tantamount to defending violations involved in use of same movement order for repeated trips.</p>
<p>Further inconclusive exchanges of this kind ended with Political Advisers reiterating that Allies saw no need for change of established procedures, maintenance of which must be requested.</p>
<p>To straighten out historical record, American Political Adviser noted that, whatever may have been Col <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName>’s understanding of meeting of November 20, Allied record of this meeting and understanding was that nothing had been said which implied that procedures on military trains re handling of movement orders were to be same as those on autobahn. Also pointed out that visit of Cols Forame and Baxter intended to effect delivery of samples of freight documentation which he (<persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName>) had requested. They were prepared to answer any technical questions arising out of freight documentation procedures, but had made it quite clear that they were not competent to discuss any substantive questions.</p>
<p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> expressed hope that today’s meeting would prove to Allies that there was no real excuse for disturbances which had taken place, due to very minor importance of issue involved. He then asked whether night of January 31–Feb 1 provided enough time appropriately to instruct train commanders. To this, Political Advisers responded that Allies objected to introduction of stamping of movement orders at any time in future, and that their views had been clearly expressed on this point. When <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> again said he could see no reason for Allied objections, British Political Adviser said there would have to be further communication on these matters, and that Allied position had been made clear. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> concluded by saying he thought night of Jan 31–Feb 1 was sufficient time for issuance of new instructions.</p>
<p>Col Forame, Berlin Command Transportation Officer, who accompanied American Political Adviser, concurs in foregoing account.</p>

<p>1908. Bonn’s 2218 and <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1891.<note n="1" xml:id="d3fn1">Telegram 2218 reported that the three Western Embassies had agreed to tell <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> that their movement orders would not be used more than once and, if this were not satisfactory, that train commanders or officers would stamp the orders. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221/1–1758) Telegram 1891 stated that the Department of State had reservations about either procedure and that the Political Advisers should not meet with <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> until the Department’s comments were received. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 862B.181/1–2058)</note> In view of degree of coordination which exists in Germany on course of action to be taken in response to Soviet demand that travel orders of military train passengers be stamped by Soviet officer at Marienborn, Department reluctant to issue instructions. Nonetheless we Have serious misgiving about two elements of risk which seem implicit in course of action proposed, which we believe should be considered tripartitely before conversations begin with <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName>.</p>
<p>First, proposed course of action appears to accept Soviet thesis there are abuses in use of travel orders and that existence or elimination of these abuses is appropriate subject for Allied-Soviet negotiation and agreement. Principle under which we act is that authorities issuing travel orders determine who shall proceed to Berlin in connection with occupation of Berlin and how frequently. It follows that any question of validity or abuse of travel orders is internal disciplinary matter within competence these authorities. Any negotiation with Soviets re validity of travel orders amounts to abandonment of this principle. As consequence such negotiation, we could be drawn into dilemma of either having to comply with repeated Soviet demands for procedural changes which Soviets could exploit as means gradually gaining control over Allied travel or of breaking off discussions with Soviets under circumstances in which, having already abandoned above mentioned principle, we appear to public to be stopping Berlin travel on minor procedural issue. We wish stress in this connection that recent changes in form of our travel orders cannot be considered product of negotiation with Soviets but were instituted by us on our own authority in order provide more uniform documentation and thus help eliminate misunderstandings. Copies of new forms given Soviets for their information and not for their acceptance.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_8" n="8" facs="0033"/>
<p>Second, we believe Soviet demand may be basically motivated by desire build up system under which effective Soviet or ultimate <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control over Allied recognized travel can be established. Stamping of travel orders by Soviet officers would obviously constitute extension of Soviet control and is unacceptable. Proposed alternative that train commander stamp or otherwise confirm or limit validity of travel orders in presence of Soviet officer at Marienborn is in our opinion also highly undesirable, for it appears to us to concede principle of Soviet contention. Making this concession could provide basis further Soviet demands and is not consistent with principle Soviets must accept travel orders issued by competent Allied authorities as conclusive evidence traveler is Allied official personnel and entitled unrestricted access to Berlin on basis quadripartite agreements.</p>
<p>Although we realize normal procedure envisages tripartite discussion questions this type only in Berlin and Bonn, in view time factor request Embassies London and Paris convey our views Foreign Offices.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">On January 27 the Western Political Advisers met with <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> who rejected both proposals put forward by the United States (see <ref target="#d2fn1">footnote 1</ref> above), but extended the deadline for stamping the movement orders until February 10.

<p>2015. Bonn’s 2328 rptd Berlin 497 <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss> 371 pouched London, Paris.<note n="1" xml:id="d4fn1">Telegram 2328, January 29, reported that during a meeting that day of representatives of the three Western Embassies, the British proposed that they agree to Soviet stamping of movement orders if the stamping were done on the station platforms, there were no delay in the train schedules, and train crews had 30-day orders. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221/1–2958)</note> As indicated <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1908<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2"><ref target="#d3">Document 3</ref>.</note> Department foresees serious dangers in present course of developments re military trains. While it is possible <pb xml:id="pg_9" n="9" facs="0034"/>that Soviet stamping of orders at checkpoint can be regarded as technical detail not incompatible with Allied right of access, it probably forms part of pattern of continuing Soviet effort put themselves in position control who may travel on military trains. We may therefore merely be postponing time at which basic issue must be faced in manner likely involve train stoppage and high level protests. Whatever course of action we may follow on stamping issue, Department considers it imperative we impress on Soviets as forcefully as possible our determination maintain our fundamental position that question of who is to travel on our military trains is solely for decision by Ambassadors and Commanding Generals.</p>
<p>Embassy’s and Berlin’s reports of British and French position and assessment of Soviet firmness indicate we are now faced with alternative of acceding to Soviet demand re stamping or suffering unilateral suspension our train travel without UK and French support. Our position is weakened further by fact movement orders on US freight trains have been stamped by Soviets for two years. (We agree entirely with <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss> stamping Autobahn orders in no way analogous to that of passengers traveling on military train). It seems undesirable to make major issue of this procedure if withdrawal is to follow. These factors suggest desirability that any change in procedure be effected in such a way that fundamental principle does not suffer.</p>
<p>If Embassy unable to work out tripartitely any better solution which would offer reasonable prospect of success, we therefore prepared accept position set forth para 1 a, b, c <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> but suggest that Three Political Advisers leave with <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kotsiuba</persName> memorandum making following points: In deciding to permit Soviets, if they so desire, to put stamp on movement orders Three Powers consider such procedure meaningless. Such procedure does not imply any recognition of Soviet authority to question validity of those orders, either generally or for the particular travel, or to raise any question regarding individual passengers in connection with train clearance. Ambassadors and Commanders-in-Chief in Germany have sole competence to determine who may travel to and from Berlin in connection with occupation of Berlin and whether orders valid for such travel. Role of Soviet authorities in connection with documentation these passengers is solely to clear without delay properly identified Allied Autobahn passengers and properly documented Allied military trains.</p>
<p>Such paper would record officially our position and serve as point of reference in future communications to Soviets in event of further difficulties. Technical conditions suggested by British re stamping might better be presented orally since including them in memorandum stating basic principles would detract from effect.</p>

<p>G–29. Bonn’s 2100 and 2102.<note n="1" xml:id="d6fn1">Telegram 2100 is <ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>. Telegram 2102 reported that the British and French were unwilling to consult with the West Germans on the question of dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/1–958)</note> We have deferred replying these two messages in order take into account series of recent developments re documentation on military trains and problem of overflights. Your <pb xml:id="pg_11" n="11" facs="0036"/>message raises number of important issues, on which we have following comments:</p>
<p>1. Your 2100 implies there is inconsistency in our plans for handling land and air access problems because of different approach to question of dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel. You suggest this may arise from fact our air access rights are more solidly based on legal grounds than ground access and that our making distinction may give rise to confusion in mind of public. We believe however that difference in our approach to surface and air access problems stems primarily from difference in physical situations, not from feeling our legal rights re air access are more solidly based than in case ground access. While it is true the specific modes of exercising these rights are set forth in different documents, they all in final analysis go back to our basic legal position arising from unconditional surrender and the occupation of Berlin pursuant to <gloss target="#t_EAC1">EAC</gloss> agreements<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">Regarding the <gloss target="#t_EAC1">EAC</gloss> agreements on Berlin, see <ref target="frus1945v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1945, vol. III</ref>, pp. 539 <hi rend="italic">passim;</hi> for the air access agreements, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., pp. 1576 ff.</note> and Truman–Stalin exchange of letters.<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">Presumably these are the letters of June 14 and 16, 1945, printed <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., pp. 135–137.</note> In addition ground access was covered by New York and Paris agreements<note n="4" xml:id="d6fn4">For text of the New York and Paris agreements of 1949, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., <ref target="frus1949v03">1949, vol. III</ref>, p. 751 and pp. 1062–1065.</note> and our present legal rights in this regard, whatever their origin, are confirmed most clearly in these agreements and based on practices and procedures which they were designed to maintain and protect.</p>
<p>2. Tripartite contingency planning with respect to ground access, which has governmental approval, envisages acceptance of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel at Autobahn and rail checkpoints in sense that we would if necessary be prepared show Allied documentation to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel as we are now doing to Soviets. On other hand United States view is that we should not accept <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel in <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>. If this is in fact difference in policy as you suggest, in our view it would arise from fundamental differences in degree of physical control Soviets or East Germans can exercise over our movements. In case of air access we can continue to fly over Soviet Zone regardless of Soviet or East German objections unless physical interference is attempted on scale which could lead to most serious consequences. Furthermore <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> is in our Sector and we can physically exclude <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel from access to <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> offices. In case of ground access not only is substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel for Soviet personnel in no way under our control but Soviet or East German personnel can physically block our movements. In our view this distinction is entirely sound, and assuming that policy in each case is well founded we see no reason for altering it merely because distinction, in absence <pb xml:id="pg_12" n="12" facs="0037"/>our explaining it to them, may not be readily apparent to Germans (see paragraph 6 below).</p>
<p>3. While we recognize that substitution <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for Soviet personnel at checkpoints would raise problems of various sorts and would be in any case an undesirable development, our feeling is that existing tripartite policy as incorporated in basic policy paper HICOM/P(54)5 Revised/Final<note n="5" xml:id="d6fn5">This 28-page report, dated August 23, 1954, was divided into five sections: 1) Access to Berlin, 2) Passports and Visas Issued by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, 3) Commercial Relations Between the Western Powers and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, 4) Protection of Nationals and Interests in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and 5) Participation of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in International Organizations. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/8–2354)</note> (which was worked out not long after Soviets first announced in 1954 they would treat <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as sovereign) is basically sound as representing choice of lesser of two evils. Our legal rights with respect to Berlin access are essentially to come and go without interference. Provided there were no interference with our movements it would be hard to make a convincing legal argument insofar as rights of access are concerned that there was a vital difference whether a Soviet or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> official looked at our papers. While an argument predicated on quadripartite responsibility can be made, it would be directed to a narrow point on which we would not have support of specific language in pertinent agreements. We question whether this is the point over which we should go to the mat with Soviets. We are inclined to feel that analysis in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 265 to <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss> of December 3 repeated Department as Bonn’s 1919 December 17<note n="6" xml:id="d6fn6">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221/12–1757)</note> is fundamentally correct, i.e., that if Soviets turn over administration of checkpoints to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> this will reflect a fundamental decision which we are not likely be able get them to change.</p>
<p>4. Basic rationale of existing policy on point under discussion is that authorizing Allied travelers to identify themselves to East German personnel at checkpoints and show travel orders on same basis as they have done in past to Soviet personnel would not involve any serious compromise of the basic principle that Soviets are responsible for insuring unrestricted access of properly identified Allied Autobahn travelers, convoys and military trains. It does not appear to us accurate to suggest our planning is based on assumption that if <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel are substituted for Soviets they would content themselves with looking at documents. Present planning takes into account possibility that East German personnel might go beyond this and raise new demands and conditions of types you suggest. We recognize that practical problems might be raised regarding channel of communication for discussing matter. Since our basic position is that personnel at recognized checkpoints, regardless of their nationality or whether they are military or <pb xml:id="pg_13" n="13" facs="0038"/>civilian personnel, are acting under Soviet authority, we would continue to hold Soviets responsible for any interference with our movements and would continue to discuss matter only with Soviet authorities. On this basis issue of recognition of “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>” would not really arise since by hypothesis it would be immaterial whether these new conditions or procedures were imposed by Soviet authorities themselves or by others such as East Germans acting under Soviet authority. While there is of course possibility Soviets might refuse discuss matter with us and refer us to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, our further course of action would be based on fundamental principle of Soviet responsibility.</p>
<p>5. Exact point at which we refuse to submit to Communist demands with respect to some question of documentation or procedure is difficult to draw in advance, given variety of circumstances in which issues have arisen over period of time. In general it seems to us our interest is basically to keep lines of communication open. While situations may arise in which it will be necessary to suspend travel temporarily, we think that in borderline case we stand to lose more by dramatizing situation and later acquiescing than by adjusting to situation at the beginning. Basic position we must defend is that we can not accept any action by which Communists seek to substitute their decision for ours as to who can go to Berlin and what can be shipped to Berlin in connection with our occupation responsibilities.</p>
<p>6. As we understand it one of your principal concerns about question our existing policy is based on effect its implementation would have on German opinion. It appears to Department this is matter on which German views should be sought. We do not suggest Germans be brought into all details of Allied instructions and planning with regard to military trains, etc. However fundamental policy re <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel at checkpoints is related to whole series of matters on which we are constantly dealing with Federal Republic. It is type of problem on which we agreed to coordinate views as far back as 1954 and we consider it essential that German comments be sought. In view of nature of Soviet actions to which we have referred, we believe this should be done at high level at early date. If British and French Embassies continue to be opposed, we are prepared raise this matter at governmental level.</p>
<p>7. As for your comments re planning for airlift to meet needs Berlin garrison in event suspension of travel by military train and Autobahn, we are in accord your rationale as to considerations which might make limited airlift necessary and desirable. Re details of planning you are now conducting with <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss> and USAFE, we see nothing in these details inconsistent with those contained in already agreed quadripartite airlift planning and believe in fact they will constitute useful supplement thereto.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_14" n="14" facs="0039"/>
<p>8. In looking ahead we believe that issue of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> “sovereignty” is likely to be thrust at us more and more. Until recently we had not considered there was any imminent possibility of substitution East German for Soviet personnel at checkpoints. On other hand various Soviet actions which have resulted in bringing about standardization of documentation and practices can be reconciled with possibility Soviets are endeavoring create situation in which, should they desire turn supervision of Allied passage over to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, this could be done with least possibility of immediate friction or crisis with Allies. Recent Soviet actions suggest turnover to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> may be more imminent than previously appeared. Cessation of Soviet visas for Allied personnel for privileged travel, which was accompanied by publicity, altered practice in way which would have been possible [<hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>] at any time since 1954. Refusal of overflight permit for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>’s plane<note n="7" xml:id="d6fn7">On January 18 the Soviet controller at <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> stated that granting permission for a flight from Berlin to Moscow and return for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> through the air space of the German Democratic Republic was a matter that had to be taken up with the East Germans. (Telegram 848 from Belrin, January 18; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762B.5411/1–1858)</note> which we assume Soviets were aware would result in publicity, also reached into established practices. Finally, <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty issue was again thrust at us by publication of exchange of letters on Warsaw courier flight.<note n="8" xml:id="d6fn8">For texts of these letters, January 18 and 25, see <hi rend="italic">Dokumente,</hi> III, Band 4/1958, Erster Halbband, pp. 161–162 and 444.</note> While we may be reading too much significance into these actions in light of repeated Soviet posture in recent notes and statements that West must accept reality of status quo under circumstances, we think we must be prepared face intensification of introduction <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty issue into Berlin access problem and elsewhere.</p>
<p>9. We agree that elaboration of our detailed contingency planning with respect to these problems would be useful. We believe however that planning of this character must be centered in Germany and do not feel it would be appropriate or useful for us to take matters of detail up with British and French Governments which have not been discussed fully in Germany. There is no accepted center for tripartite discussions among three Governments, and specific problems involved are so much a function of factual situation in Germany and practices which have developed on the ground over many years that raising them at governmental level is likely to result only in having British and French Governments refer them back to Germany for resolution. At any rate practical responsibility for exercise of retained powers in Germany has been vested by Three Governments in Ambassadors by tripartite agreement signed at Paris on October 23, 1954.<note n="9" xml:id="d6fn9">For text of this agreement, see <ref target="frus1952-54v05p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1952–1954, vol.

<item>Governing Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Willy Brandt</persName>, Berlin<note n="1" xml:id="d7fn1">On November 22, 1957, Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> announced that he would visit the United States in February 1958 as a guest of Lufthansa Airlines. Following his announcement the Department arranged a series of meetings in Washington for the mayor. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> arrived in Philadelphia on February 7 and, after his conversations in Washington, he visited New York and Boston.

<p>The Secretary, after greeting Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>, said that we are fully aware of the importance of Berlin and of the impressive strength, industry and courage of its people. He recalled that his last visit had been in 1954, but that he had also been there during the airlift. He said that Berlin had shown tremendous firmness in its position against Communism, but unfortunately the Soviets seemed also firm in their position.</p>
<p>He stated, however, that the President and he have made it a practice, on every possible occasion, to refer to the reunification of Germany.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_16" n="16" facs="0041"/>
<p>He believed that constant pressure on this point and hammering away at the Soviet position would lead the Soviets, at some time, to find that it was in their interests to yield a point and that this might be reunification. Experience with the Austrian Treaty had been along these lines. After hundreds of meetings and constant pressure, they had suddenly decided to grant the State Treaty.<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">For documentation on the negotiations leading to the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, May 15, 1955, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1955–1957, vol V</ref>, pp. 1 ff.</note> They had done this, in some measure, to secure a Summit meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3">For documentation on the Geneva Summit Conference, July 18–23, 1955, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., pp. 119 ff.</note> At the present time, unfortunately, they probably did not believe they need pay such a high price for a Summit meeting in view of the manner in which many countries were willing to give it to them without a price and were not likely to yield in the German case. Unfortunately, the German problem, unlike the Austrian case, is not an isolated problem, but is related to that of other countries, notably Poland. The Soviets clearly fear the impact of yielding on other countries, particularly those between West Germany and the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is a very dangerous man and the Minsk speech showed the brutality of the Stalin days and many of the doctrines of Lenin.<note n="4" xml:id="d7fn4">An extract from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech at Minsk on January 22 is in <hi rend="italic">Pravda,</hi> January 25, 1958, pp. 2–3.</note></p>
<p>The Secretary said that he tried last fall, in a long talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, to persuade him that this country did not wish Russia to be surrounded by unfriendly countries. The concept of the Cordon Sanitaire would not work in the case of a strong nation like Russia. He told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that, unfortunately, their actions were such as to create enemies, rather that friends in the nations surrounding them and that, unless they yielded before the point of no return had been reached, the Soviet Union might become the most hated country in the world.</p>
<p>He had been discussing these matters recently, he said, with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d7fn5">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> had been in Washington for consultations in January and early February.</note> who stated that there were, in his opinion, many weaknesses and signs of change within the Soviet Republic. He believed that Hungary and Poland, where the young had shown their rejection of Communism, were indications of the unsettled state of affairs and referred, in this connection, also to the refugees flowing from East Germany to the West. He asked the Mayor what he thought of the purge in East Germany.<note n="6" xml:id="d7fn6">On February 8 the German Democratic Republic announced that Wollweber, Schirdewan, and Oelssner had been expelled from the Central Committee and Politburo of the Socialist Unity Party for opposition to <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>.</note></p>
<p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> replied that he believed that Wollweber had tried to look to the Soviets to circumvent <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>, but the Soviets had concluded, <pb xml:id="pg_17" n="17" facs="0042"/>quite logically, that they could not tolerate a <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName>-type<note n="7" xml:id="d7fn7"><persName corresp="#p_GW1">Wladyslaw Gomulka</persName>, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers’ Party.</note> solution in East Germany. He stated that a nationalistic solution, in a divided Germany, could not be acceptable as a safe situation for the Soviets because it would certainly go toward the Federal Republic. Since, however, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> is the most hated man in all of Germany, they must rely more than ever on their twenty-two divisions.</p>
<p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> added that they had recently shown their fear of the poison of contact with the West by making it even harder for the people in East Germany to travel to the West and trying to bar students, in particular, from contacts with their friends and relatives in the Federal Republic. Berlin, he said, was, in this case, in the period when it was hard to make substantial progress toward reunification, the one place where we can show our conviction of the final solution of a reunified Germany. It was important, therefore, to establish and increase the links and to strengthen the political connections between Berlin and the Federal Republic and thus maintain Berlin in its assured position with respect to its meaning for the future of Germany.</p>
<p>The Secretary answered that the United States was absolutely prepared to take a strong position with respect to Berlin. He said, unfortunately, the situation was often clouded by technicalities and minor details which made it difficult to make our position known. We would welcome an appropriate opportunity of showing our firmness.</p>
<p>The Secretary then said that he did not know whether the Mayor would agree, but that he believed that the Soviets would never accept a solution of a neutral Germany. He said he based his view, in part at least, on conversations with Molotov, whose ideas still prevail, although he has disappeared; with <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> in London; with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, and others. He said a genuinely neutralized Germany would be regarded by the Russians as dangerous and likely to play one party against another in a political game which would bring with it tremendous risks. It was his opinion, he stated, that the Soviets would prefer a Germany under the control of the institutions of the West, <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>, Common Market, and other restraining Western influences to one which was completely uncontrolled. If they could not themselves exercise control, they would prefer to see Germany subject to the restraints of Western European organizations.</p>
<p>The Mayor replied that he understood, indeed, the point made by the Secretary. The Mayor of Free Berlin could not advocate a weak Germany. A Germany which was a part of Western Europe could only be safe in a strong Europe. A Germany which was unstable and not included in the systems of the Western world would, in fact, lead to an <pb xml:id="pg_18" n="18" facs="0043"/>unpredictable and risky situation. He was not sure, however, that the system with which Germany should be linked need be exactly that of the present Western European alliance. He said that there might be adjustments or modifications which would lead to solutions and that one must keep trying to find such solutions.</p>
<p>The Secretary stated that he, too, felt that some modifications of present organization and mechanisms of cooperation could be found. The offers of security and the European Security Treaty of 1955<note n="8" xml:id="d7fn8">Presumably <persName corresp="#p_DEL1">Dulles</persName> is referring to the proposal made by the Soviet Delegation on October 31, 1955, at the Geneva Foreign Ministers meeting.</note> and the pledges that had been contemplated at that time had never been fully appreciated and, he believed, some changes could be made which would make the search for solutions more profitable.</p>
<p>The Secretary concluded by stating that he was well aware of the astonishing capacity shown by the people of Berlin and that he understood that they were very fortunate in having the leadership of the Mayor.<note n="9" xml:id="d7fn9">In a seven-line memorandum drafted on February 11, <persName corresp="#p_MTD1">McKiernan</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> was “strongly in favor of the Federal Government’s proposal for opening Berlin to international air traffic, provided there should be no adverse effect on Allied air access to Berlin.” (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/2–1158)</note></p>

<item>Mr. Albrecht von Kessel, Chargé d’Affaires ad interim, German Embassy</item>
<item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRE1">Raymond E. Lisle</persName>—<gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss></item>
</list>
<p>In response to a question from the President, Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> explained that he was in the United States as a guest of the Ford <pb xml:id="pg_19" n="19" facs="0044"/>Foundation and that a primary purpose of his visit was to convey the gratitude of the Government and people of Berlin for the aid and other support and encouragement given to the City by the United States. He wished to assure the President that American aid had been well used.</p>
<p>The President expressed his confidence that that was the case. He commented on the glowing reports he had had of the Congress Hall.<note n="1" xml:id="d8fn1">The Berlin Congress Hall, which had been constructed from funds contributed by the United States, West Germany, and Berlin, opened on September 19, 1957.</note> He regretted that he had not seen Berlin for many years and hoped that when any of his friends next visit Berlin they would send him pictures of the City as it is today.</p>
<p>The Mayor explained the great progress made by the City since the end of the blockade. He noted one hundred and ten thousand new buildings have been constructed since 1951. Some 20,000 additional buildings are being built each year. While industrial production has not increased in as spectacular a manner as in the Federal Republic, the increase has been substantial. Since the blockade, during which industrial production was only 17% of prewar figures, the index has risen to over 120%. At present the rate of increase is greater than in the Federal Republic.</p>
<p>The President inquired whether the people of Berlin experience difficulty with their travel and trade to and from West Germany. The Mayor stated there had never been trouble with air travel. At various times since the blockade there have been difficulties with the Soviets over use of the railroads, roads and canals. There was no present difficulty so far as German traffic was concerned. How long the present easy situation would continue he could not say. He understood that the Allies had had occasional difficulties over the military trains.</p>
<p>The President agreed that one never knew what the Soviets were likely to do. It has always been clear that they would like to cut off access to Berlin. However, they realize how serious a step this would be. He, himself, had supported General <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName>’s idea in 1949 that force could appropriately be used to re-establish access to the City.<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">Regarding General <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName>’s views in 1948, not 1949, on the use of force to re-establish access to Berlin, see Jean E. Smith, ed., <hi rend="italic">The Papers of General <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Lucius D. Clay</persName>, Germany 1945–1949,</hi> vol. II, pp. 733–746.</note> The Soviets have broken so many pledges that it is very difficult to put any faith in them. He, himself, thinks that the Soviets now would like to make and keep a few pledges. However, we need some hostage, some general type of guarantee, that any pledges they might give will be kept. He recalled the thinking with regard to Berlin and the East Zone in 1945. Allied planners in Europe had thought that Thuringia should be included in the Western zones. Subsequently, they had thought in terms of building a new <pb xml:id="pg_20" n="20" facs="0045"/>capital in Germany at the point where the various zones came together. It had been concluded, however, that Berlin must be re-established as the capital. It became apparent soon after the war had ended that the Soviets were not acting in good faith in Germany.</p>
<p>The President asked what goods were exported from Berlin, and was told by the Mayor that the main exports were electrical goods and women’s clothing. Berlin has regained the leading position in Germany in the women’s clothing industry. The President inquired about the use of new synthetic fibers and was assured by the Mayor that Berlin, after a late start in this field, was now using them extensively.</p>
<p>The President inquired about the Mayor’s itinerary and expressed gratification that Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> on a previous trip had seen not only the Eastern seaboard but the West as well.</p>
<p>The President reflected that most of his friends in Germany today were in the Government. He hoped that Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> would convey to them his greetings and tell them again how strongly this Government and our people want Germany reunified and a strong and viable nation in Central Europe. However, strongly as we desire Germany to be reunified; this must be by free elections and not by the organization of a confederation of which one part would be controlled by the Soviets.</p>
<p>The Mayor expressed again the gratitude of the people of Berlin for the assistance and support of the United States. He wished to assure the President that the people of Berlin were still filled with the same spirit as during the blockade and that they remain convinced that Berlin is of importance not only because of its local problems but because of its influence upon the whole of Eastern Germany.</p>
<p>The President said he was convinced from the frequent oral and written reports he receives on Berlin that it has become a true show-window for the West. He asked Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> when next he had occasion to address the people of Berlin to transmit his greetings and continuing interest in their problems.</p>

<p>During a luncheon given by the Secretary of Defense,<note n="1" xml:id="d9fn1"><p>In a memorandum, dated February 12, <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> briefed Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> on the Berlin situation and made the following recommendations:</p>
<p>“In order to dispel any doubts which may be held by Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> regarding the U.S. position on this matter, it is suggested that you emphasize the readiness of our garrison in Berlin to take whatever action is necessary for the protection of the city against attacks of any kind from any quarter.</p>
<p>“It is also suggested that you assure the Mayor that the U.S. intends to maintain a hard line against Soviet interference with travel to and from Berlin, i.e., that despite recent harassment of U.S. rail traffic, we adhere strongly to the position that U.S. authorities have the right to determine who travels to and from Berlin and that our rights to an access to the city are clear and inviolable.” (Washington National Records Center, RG 330, <gloss target="#t_OASDISA1">OASD/ISA</gloss> Files: FRC 62 A 1698, Germany)</p></note> which was attended, in addition to those named above, by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Service Secretaries, and senior officers of the Armed Services, discussion was of a general character. However, in responding to a toast, Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> explained his views as to one phase of the commemorative ceremonies for the Tenth Anniversary of the Berlin Airlift to be held in Berlin this fall. He said he was going to ask the people of Berlin to contribute to a fund which would be used: (a) to bring to Berlin for the ceremonies the widows and children of pilots killed in the airlift; and (b) to provide scholarships for the children of such pilots at the Free University of Berlin.</p>
<p>After the luncheon, General Taylor asked the German visitors, with the exception of the Chargé, together with General Lemnitzer and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRE1">Lisle</persName>, to meet briefly with him in his office. In response to questions, Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> stated there were no present difficulties with regard to German travel and commercial traffic between Berlin and the Federal <pb xml:id="pg_22" n="22" facs="0047"/>Republic; that he understood there had been some minor difficulties with the military trains; that he believed the Soviet Zone authorities would like to make difficulties for West Berlin but were kept in control by the Soviets who desire to avoid creating any serious issue with the Three Western Powers; that the morale of the people of Berlin remained high; that the spirit of opposition continued strong in the Soviet Zone; that he had been troubled by the flight to the West of several East German clergymen a few weeks ago because he believed it essential that the clergymen remain with their East German flocks (General Taylor commented at this point that he had read of the flight of these clergymen in the <hi rend="italic">Berlin Tagesspiegel,</hi> which he receives daily); that he had no problem which he wished to bring to General Taylor’s attention. General Taylor recalled his service in Berlin. General Lemnitzer spoke of the impression made on him by Berlin when he visited the city in the company of the Secretary of Defense earlier this winter.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_SX1">SX</gloss>–4099. To <gloss target="#t_USCOB1">USCOB</gloss> for <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>, info AmEmb for <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> and EUCOM for Palmer. Sgd <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>.</p>
<p>1. In his office with only General of the Army <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>, Major Spahr, and Lt Vturin present, General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> stated that there was one <pb xml:id="pg_25" n="25" facs="0050"/>matter of business that he would like to discuss with General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> as one soldier to another. It was a matter with which General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> was probably not familiar, therefore an immediate answer was not expected. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> then stated that it was certain that General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>, as a soldier, understood General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> problems regarding the United States garrison in Berlin. That garrison had to be supplied and the troops in that garrison had to be taken out of Berlin to areas in Western Germany periodically for training. Also existing agreement provided General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> with the right to execute these supply and troop movements without interference. Marshal Grechko, General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>’s predecessor, understood and agreed with General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> on these principles.</p>
<p>2. Unfortunately, General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> continued, there has developed a maze of procedures which appear to be purely harassments and which cannot be accepted. For instance, if it becomes necessary to transport an officer with 30 troops either into or out of Berlin it should be necessary only for that officer to present a document at the Soviet checkpoint showing the 30 troops, under the command of an officer, are proceeding from Berlin to Helmstedt; in other words, a simple movement order. It should not be necessary to list the names of the soldiers in uniform or to show personal identification cards for each soldier. Similarly, if a column of supply trucks was making the trip it should be only necessary to show a document which listed the number of vehicles, by type, their commander, the number of officers and men involved, and the fact that the vehicles were carrying military supplies and equipment.</p>
<p>3. General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> appeared to agree with General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> and asked what seemed to be the difficulty.</p>
<p>4. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> replied that instead of this simple soldierly procedure, Soviet personnel at the checkpoints were demanding documents showing the names of all troops involved in a particular movement, their identification cards, and detached/detailed lists of their trucks and cargo. This procedure was unnecessary, ridiculous, and nothing but harassment.</p>
<p>5. General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> agreed and stated that for troop movements by truck, all that should be necessary is for the officer in charge to procure a document showing that he together with a certain number of troops was going to proceed from checkpoint to checkpoint. This document should then be stamped to affirm that passage was made through the checkpoint if questioned enroute and that was all that should be necessary.</p>
<p>6. Concerning supplies General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> stated that all that should be necessary was a document stating the number and types of vehicles and the types of supplies—bread,flour, military supplies, etc.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_26" n="26" facs="0051"/>
<p>7. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> objected stating that he saw no reason to list the types of supplies since all he would be transporting was military supplies and that lists were cumbersome and unnecessary. There was no intention to transport German nationals or any type of supplies other than on military vehicles moving into or out of Berlin.</p>
<p>8. General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> said he meant simply broad categories of supplies such as food and military supplies and that he had no interest in the quantities involved.</p>
<p>9. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> repeated that it should be sufficient to state only that military supplies and/or equipment were being transported.</p>
<p>10. General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> nodded and said that when he returned<note n="1" xml:id="d12fn1"><persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> was returning to Moscow for consultations.</note> he would gather the personnel who were involved in these matters and would investigate present procedures.</p>
<p>11. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> stated that the procedures which are used to clear his personal train were an example of the degree of complexities involved in present procedures. A translation of an order which was signed by General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> had to be presented at the checkpoint and in addition a demand was made last week to see his personal identification card. The reply which was and would be given to the latter demand was that General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> would show his personal identification card to General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> and to General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> only.</p>
<p>12. General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> remarked that General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> should give advance notice of his intention to travel by train. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> replied that he always gave at least 24 hours notice of his intention to travel by train.</p>
<p>13. General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> remarked that he had never visited a checkpoint but that he would investigate the procedures when he returned to his headquarters.</p>
<p>14. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> told General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> that he had been certain that General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> would share his viewpoint on this purely military matter and that he hoped that an improvement would result.</p>
<p>15. The meeting lasted approximately 25 minutes.</p>
<p>16. In the opinion of Major Spahr, Lt. Vturin who translated General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>’ remarks from English into Russian gave an accurate translation which fully reflected the spirit as well as the content of what General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> had to say.</p>

(Washington National Records Center, RG 319, Headquarters Department of the Army, Communications Center Files)</note></p>
<p>1. At meeting today between Allied Political Advisers and Col. <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> it quickly became clear that Soviet interpretation of <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> exchanges<note n="4" xml:id="d13fn4">See <ref target="#d12">Document 12</ref>.</note> differs radically from American version.</p>
<p>2. As Chairman for month French opened meeting commenting that, because of <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> exchanges plus recent turnback of US convoy, new elements added to situation which made it desirable that American political adviser lead discussion for Western powers. At prior meeting political advisers British and French had agreed to stand on position A and, if Soviet accepted sample document, that they would recommend it to their superiors.</p>
<p>3. We referred to recent exchange of messages between <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>, noting that these appeared to provide possible basis for understanding on documentation. Said we had prepared sample document coverning all requisite points on one piece paper. Following perusal of sample document, <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> stated questions raised by document appeared broader than discussion at last meeting had indicated.<note n="5" xml:id="d13fn5">At their previous meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> on June 18, the three Western Political Advisers had agreed to present a sample document stating whether convoy cargo was military supplies or equipment. (Telegram 1365 from Bonn, June 18; Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/6–1858)</note> He then said he would suggest some amendments to form.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_28" n="28" facs="0053"/>
<p>These were:</p>
<list><item>A. More detailed specifications of type of cargo, that is, a breakdown showing cargo carried as armament, foodstuffs or other equipment. B. Total weight of cargo should be shown and number of cases, barrels, or other containers. E [C]. If such a listing made Soviet checkpoint officer would, of course, reserve right to look into covered trucks to insure that cargo carried agreed with manifest. He added that in this way Soviets would be able fully to carry out procedure of control specified in agreement of June 29, 1945.<note n="6" xml:id="d13fn6">Regarding the June 29, 1945, agreement, see <ref target="frus1945v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1945, vol. III</ref>, pp. 353–361.</note>
</item></list>
<p>4. We replied we thought that, at previous meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName>, term “supplies and equipment” had been agreed upon as sufficient in principle. We emphasized that we could not agree to points made by <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> regarding listing of cargo and would only report his position to higher authorities. We did not believe that his suggested breakdown served any necessary purpose. If cargo certified as military supplies and equipment by competent military authority that should suffice. <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> replied that three categories mentioned were important, and if such breakdown not provided suggested documentation would serve no useful purpose. He added that it was not necessary to describe in detail type armament carried, i.e. rifles, tank parts, machine guns, etc. What was important was category of supplies and in case of foodstuffs (tonnage or kilogram weight) and other equipment (number of cases or other containers). We again stressed principle involved, emphasizing it was Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>’ (and we had thought Gen <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>’s) understanding if officer certified to General nature of contents, his word should be enough. As to Soviet claim to inspect cargo vehicles, we pointed out, this would be completely incompatible with long-standing precedent and was objectionable in principle.</p>
<p>5. In reply to request for his comments on remainder of form apart from section on cargo documentation, <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> hedged, stating he had paid particular attention only to disputable item. He did comment, however, that portion of sample document covering personnel would represent weakening of Soviet controls as now enforced. He requested time to study document further and to obtain instructions. Regarding sufficiency of “officer’s word”, he said he did not mean his comments to infer any distrust of Allies. On contrary, if distrust were involved Soviets would have demanded that individual containers be broken open for inspection, which not done at present nor intended in future. Soviets permitted Allies to bring to Berlin via autobahn practically what they wished. Documentation by cargo type and quantity is necessary measure of control, and it therefore not clear to Soviets why Political <pb xml:id="pg_29" n="29" facs="0054"/>Advisers unwilling agree to have this information on manifest. West has nothing to lose, and Soviets’ only aim is to make impossible cases of abuse on part of drivers and <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>’s who travel on trucks. <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> did not believe question of cargo documentation of sufficient importance to necessitate further referral to Commanders-in-Chief. He concluded by stating Soviets would study our draft and at subsequent meeting he would comment on first part.</p>
<p>6. After stating that he supported U.S. position as presented, French Political Adviser then noted that <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName>’s suggested procedure appeared much like a customs’ check. This <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> denied, stating in customs’ check each individual item examined whereas this not Soviet purpose. <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> stated: 1. his suggested procedure should not be interpreted as intention to impose customs type control; 2. Soviet checkpoint officers would glance at truck contents only to see if numbers of cases matched numbers listed on manifest. If truck was open, no need to enter vehicle if cargo readily apparent from outside, but if truck covered, checkpoint officer must look in to examine cargo.</p>
<p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> asked if British had comment, and British Political Adviser stated only that Soviet proposals represented “a grave departure from established procedures”. Otherwise he could only stress his concurrence with U.S.</p>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> closed meeting with comment that, if Political Advisers would explain Soviet motives to superiors, he was certain they would agree with his proposals. He queried whether first part of proposed form intended to cover only groups of trucks. We replied that sample document could be modified for use either by single truck or convoy of trucks.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi></p>
<p>9. We have impression that new, stiffer Soviet position on cargo documentation stems directly from instructions issued from General of Army <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>’s headquarters. <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> had never previously hinted that verification of manifests was immediate Soviet objective. On June 28 British military radio truck turned back at Nowawes checkpoint when Soviets not permitted have look at contents. In response to protest by Acting British Political Adviser, <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> stated that Soviet control officer at checkpoint had been instructed by General of Army <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> to exercise discretion as to whether he should look at contents of trucks. However, since Acting British Political Adviser had vouched for military nature of contents truck would be allowed to pass in this instance without inspection.</p>
<p>10. While in good humor and courteous in manner, <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> presented Soviet position without hesitation and gave no indication much scope left for concessions. British and French are obviously not happy <pb xml:id="pg_30" n="30" facs="0055"/>with direction in which situation developing. They find ominous reference to military trains in third paragraph June 28 message from <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> to <gloss target="#t_CINCUSAREUR1">CINCUSAREUR</gloss>. Also noted with us that reference to quantity and nature of military cargo second paragraph of <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>’s message forewarned that Sovets would not be satisfied with listing of cargo merely as “military supplies and equinment”.<note n="7" xml:id="d13fn7">In his diary entry for June 30 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> wrote: “Earlier in the afternoon, <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> reported to me on the meeting, held this morning, of the four political advisers. Soviet Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> demanded truck and convoy documentation in terms far more exacting than we have ever used. This is an unsatisfactory situation, and belies the understanding General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> thought he had reached with General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>. We will sweat with this one.” (Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D 327)</note></p>

<p>[Here follows a paragraph on an unrelated subject.]</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> arrived at lunch time, preceded by General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Martin Hillenbrand</persName> and others interested in the Berlin access affair. I had a long talk alone with <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> regarding the future course of negotiations on military convoy and individual truck movements, but could not reconcile in all particulars our differing points of view. Later we adjourned to the conference room to have a general discussion. I sympathize with Hank’s desire to yield nothing to the Soviets but do not think it is probable they will accept looser documentation than we have been in the habit of giving them. He believes perhaps they will. At any rate, if they refuse he is in favor of stalling the talks as long as possible and his view of “possible” is a period of many months. The British and French would never accept such a postponement if it were to interfere, as it probably would, with their present traffic. We finally decided to let the political advisers in Berlin take one more crack at this problem and insist upon the so-called simple document as presented by General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> to General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d14fn1">The Political Advisers met again with <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> on July 18.

<p>117. At his request Soviet Commandant General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> called on General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> this morning. Former opened discussion by saying he had some questions to ask about freight on autobahn. First of these was whether, during his exchanges with Chief Group Soviet Forces Germany General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> had been speaking for British and French commanders as well as for himself. He asked this question in view of recent British protests. General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> said that he was not in a position to answer questions since he did not know, but he was able to assure General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> that, since <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> conversation,<note n="1" xml:id="d16fn1">See <ref target="#d12">Document 12</ref>.</note> matter had been fully discussed tripartitely.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> continued that, while simplified form of documentation was step in right direction, Allies have objected to two aspects of Soviet position: (1) their precipitous introduction of new procedures on August 1 which provided inadequate time for Allies to make preparations, and (2) their insistence on right of inspection of Allied vehicles.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName>, who accompanied <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>, remarked at this point that all Soviets really intended was occasionally to request that American in charge of convoy or vehicle lift up rear covering of truck to permit Soviet control officer to look in. <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> said he would reveal to us confidentially that actually Soviets had issued instructions to checkpoints to apply only partial controls on convoys and trucks until August 10. He insinuated this action taken by Soviet commandant without reference to higher headquarters.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> responded that issue was not whether attempt to look into vehicles was to be occasional or regular. He objected in principle to any maintenance of right to inspect military vehicles. This involved in effect questioning of word of responsible American officers, who would enforce disciplinary measures against any personnel attempt to falsify cargo documentation. To <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>’s rejoinder that Soviets contemplated action necessary to enable such officers to know whether falsification taking place, General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> said that this was a matter of internal discipline to be controlled by convoy commander. He added that General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> obviously would not wish Americans under similar circumstances to inspect Soviet vehicles.</p>

General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> protested this incursion to <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>. (Telegram 121 from Berlin, August 7; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221/8–758) The resulting reaction in the German press resulted in the Department’s request in telegram 408 for details on the incident. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221/8–2858)</note> Main point is we will not be able endure another invasion Steinstuecken without taking more positive and forceful action unless we are willing accept sharp and perhaps vital blow to our position Berlin and West Germany. This, we believe, remains true despite (a) uproar in Berlin aggravated by newspapers and politicians intent on forthcoming elections, and (b) would seem improbable there will be another comparable incident in near future.</p>
<p>Following are answers specific questions <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>:</p>
<p>(1) West German authorities admit their police fell down badly on job and facts have been difficult to ascertain. It seems a man whose identity not clearly ascertained entered Steinstuecken early morning and asked lamplighter if he were in West Berlin. Latter simply replied affirmatively whereupon man telephoned West Berlin police.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_34" n="34" facs="0059"/>
<p>Inadequacy of latter and undoubtedly tapped lines brought <gloss target="#t_Vopo1">Vopo</gloss>s instead. Apparently at some point as many as 800 may have surrounded Steinstuecken but very few entered. Man’s whereabouts as well as identity unknown and residents Steinstuecken afraid to talk.</p>
<p>(2) West German authorities have ordered a police radio car posted Berlin border at crossing point into zone and setting up permanent police post there. Also planning two officers, possibly retired policemen, live in Steinstuecken and be equipped appropriate communication devices. We do not wish request Soviets assure unhindered passage US patrols because (a) Soviets will, we believe, refer such request <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>; (b) we wish request nothing which may be refused unless we are prepared use force fulfill our requirements.</p>
<p>(3) Have no indication attitude British and French re possible use of force and consider it inadvisable discuss such measures with them until we have firm US position.</p>
<p>(4) We consider this advisable but are not yet ready recommend how or when and of course would do so only after US position determined.<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2"><p>Question 4 in telegram 408 reads:</p>
<p>“Is it contemplated steps would be taken make sure Soviets and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be aware our intention cross Soviet Zone territory by force if necessary to preserve order in and protect Steinstuecken?”</p></note></p>

<p rend="center">OPERATIONS COORDINATING BOARD REPORT ON GERMANY (BERLIN)</p>
<p rend="center">(<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5803—Supplement I)</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Summary Evaluation</p>
<p>1. This period brought no basic change in the situation in Berlin. The Western position was successfully maintained. The U.S.S.R., no doubt deterred by a clear realization that the city could be made untenable to the Western Powers only at the risk of major war, appeared disinclined to resort to drastic measures to bring Berlin within its area of control, preferring instead to try to effect a gradual erosion of the Western position and of Berlin’s resistance. Chronic Communist harassment continued to be one of the prices of maintaining Berlin as an outpost of freedom. However, this harassment came in the main from Communist attempts to bolster the prestige of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> regime and the economy of the Soviet Zone rather than measures directed primarily at undermining the Western position in Berlin.</p>
<p>2. The continued advance in West Berlin’s economic situation was best symbolized by the drop in unemployment to a postwar low, but the rate of economic recovery appeared to be levelling off. West Berlin’s standard of living is now 98% of the Federal Republic average. The Berlin aid program is effectively demonstrating American support in tangible form.</p>
<p>3. A review of policy is not recommended.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Major Operating Problems or Difficulties Facing the United States</p>
<p>4. <hi rend="italic">Communist Pressures.</hi> The year was replete with rumors and threats of Communist action directed against Berlin, with particular emphasis on the elimination of the remaining contacts between Western Sectors and the Soviet Sector and Zone. Concern reached a critical period in October and November 1957, following the currency reform in the Soviet Zone. The only threatened measure which has materialized to date was the rerouting of through rapid transit (<gloss target="#t_SBahn1">S-Bahn</gloss>) passenger traffic from the Soviet Zone to the Soviet Sector to bypass the Western <pb xml:id="pg_37" n="37" facs="0062"/>Sectors. However, there are still indications that the Communists are attempting to find ways to stop the flight of refugees to West Berlin, to prevent East Germans from working in West Berlin, to prevent purchases by East Germans in West Berlin, to hamper anti-Communist propaganda activities directed from West Berlin, and in general to eliminate, insofar as possible without incurring grave risks, the adverse influence which Free Berlin exerts on their attempts to communize East Germany.</p>
<p>5. <hi rend="italic">Access to Berlin.</hi></p>
<p>a. Berlin’s geographic isolation continued to be its weakest point, and the maintenance of free access to the city continued to be the most urgent problem. In general, the movement of persons and goods between the Federal Republic and West Berlin proceeded on a larger scale and with less difficulties than at any time since the war, but minor harassments continued and the vulnerability of Berlin’s line of communications was demonstrated anew. All German surface traffic was stopped by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for one day in October 1957 to facilitate the East German currency conversion. At the same time the East Germans detained, examined, and in some cases confiscated, West German parcel post shipments. In May 1958 new tolls were arbitrarily imposed by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> on interzonal waterways traffic, ostensibly to obtain funds to cover expenses which would be incurred through the construction by the Federal Republic of a dam on the Elbe but in fact also as a means of pressuring the Federal Republic to enter high-level negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The waterway toll issue developed in the same unproductive fashion as had the Soviet Zone highway toll issue in 1955. The Soviets rejected the Western Powers’ protest that the Paris Agreement of 1949<note n="1" xml:id="d19fn1">See <ref target="frus1949v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 1052–1065.</note> had been violated and insisted that the question was solely within the competence of the Germans, while the Federal Republic declined to give serious consideration to economic countermeasures and decided to reimburse the carriers to cover the toll increase.</p>
<p>b. After a year of threats, minor difficulties, and discussion, the Western Powers and the Soviets agreed on new documentation for Allied official travelers between Berlin and the Federal Republic effective December 1957. The Soviets thereupon shifted their attention to the documentation and nature of freight shipments via military trains and trucks. Although the Soviets are now shown documentation (e.g., the travel orders and identity documents of Allied travelers) which they had not seen before, there has been no significant change in the types or volume of Allied travel and goods shipments to and from Berlin.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_38" n="38" facs="0063"/>
<p>Occasional minor harassments continued, but on the whole Allied access problems are at the moment quiescent.</p>
<p>6. <hi rend="italic">Contingency Planning.</hi> After three years of effort on our part to persuade them, the British explicitly and the French implicitly have not only refused to commit themselves in advance to the use of limited military force to maintain access to Berlin but have also refused to engage in further hypothetical contingency planning on this subject.</p>
<p>7. <hi rend="italic">Aviation Problems.</hi> (See para. 21 of the Federal Republic Report dated September 3, 1958.)</p>
<p>a. Although the contingency does not now appear imminent, planning has been undertaken to deal with a situation in which the Soviets refuse to cooperate in the Berlin Air Safety Center, for example, by refusing to accept flight plans for Western Allied aircraft.</p>
<p>b. It appears likely that flights of East German aircraft in the airspace of the Berlin air corridors may occur in the future on an increasing scale, and planning to deal with this situation has been initiated.</p>
<p>d. The Soviets are attempting, in violation of quadripartite agreements, to limit the Western Powers’ use of the Berlin air corridors to altitudes between 2,500 and 10,000 feet. Although these altitudes have generally been adequate to date, the introduction of new jet and turboprop aircraft will create an operational need for higher altitudes. The possibility of asserting Western rights to use high altitudes by having U.S. Air Force aircraft conduct test flights above 10,000 feet is under study.</p>

<p>Annex A<note n="3" xml:id="d19fn3">Secret.</note></p>
<p rend="center">ADDITIONAL MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS</p>
<p>8. <hi rend="italic">New Governing Mayor.</hi> The election of <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Willy Brandt</persName> as Governing Mayor in October 1957 following the death of Otto Suhr infused new vigor into the administration of the city. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> has subsequently replaced Franz Neumann as the Chairman of Berlin’s <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and as a <pb xml:id="pg_39" n="39" facs="0064"/>member of the Executive Board of the national <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>, and he appears likely to play an increasingly important role in national politics. A visit to the United States by <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> in February 1958<note n="4" xml:id="d19fn4">See <ref target="#d7">Documents 7</ref>–<ref target="#d10">10</ref>.</note> confirmed the close ties which both Berlin and its Governing Mayor have with this country and also served to increase <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>’s stature within both Germany and the U.S.</p>
<p>9. <hi rend="italic">Assurances to Berlin.</hi> The determination of the United States to maintain the status and security of Berlin was re-stated on appropriate occasions, notably by the President to Governing Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> during the latter’s visit and by the Secretary of State during a visit to Berlin in May 1958.<note n="5" xml:id="d19fn5">See <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note></p>
<p>10. <hi rend="italic">Aid Program.</hi></p>
<p>a. The continuing program of aid to Berlin is proving a very effective means of demonstrating in tangible form American support for all that free Berlin has come to represent in opposition to Soviet imperialism. In Fiscal Year 1958, the “impact projects” selected for U.S. assistance included student housing for the Ernst Reuter Foundation and the Technical University, both of which have been endorsed by an <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> housing survey team. U.S. assistance will be given in the construction of a modern hospital to operate in conjunction with the Free University Medical School.</p>
<p>b. The Berlin aid appropriation finances also the special Soviet Zone projects designed to focus and intensify Western influences on the population of the Soviet Zone.</p>
<p>11. <hi rend="italic">Congress Hall.</hi> The Benjamin Franklin Congress Hall, turned over to the City of Berlin in April 1958, was the outstanding feature of the 1957 International Building Exposition and has become the most strikingly effective symbol of American support for Berlin. Together with the Hilton and other hotels now under construction, the Congress Hall is expected to be of key importance in the City’s drive to exploit its tourist potential.</p>
<p>12. <hi rend="italic">Relations with the Federal Republic.</hi> The increasingly close relationship between Berlin and the Federal Republic was exemplified by the election of the Governing Mayor of Berlin, in turn among the Minister-Presidents of the States of the Federal Republic, as President of the Bundesrat. In this capacity Governing Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> served as acting Federal President during President <persName corresp="#p_HT1">Heuss</persName>’ visits abroad. The Third Bundestag held its constituent session in Berlin in October 1957.</p>
<p>13. <hi rend="italic">Violation of Steinstuecken Border.</hi> Members of the East German police (the exact number involved is not clear) entered the tiny U.S. <pb xml:id="pg_40" n="40" facs="0065"/>Sector exclave of Steinstuecken on August 7, 1958 to apprehend a defector. In reply to an American protest, the Soviets denied in effect that the border violation had occurred. The West German and West Berlin press, apparently inspired in part by exaggerated accounts of the incident and confused by a lack of understanding of the isolation of and situation in the exclave, not only violently denounced the Soviets but also sharply criticized the U.S. authorities for not taking more effective action. Concern about the situation was also expressed by the Berlin Senat and the Federal German Foreign Office. Means of preventing a recurrence of such violations or coping with them more effectively are now being studied. The key problem is how to get West Berlin police or American troops across the 1000 yards of well-guarded Soviet Zone territory which separate the U.S. Sector proper from the Steinstuecken exclave.</p>

<p>2. In response to guidance by the Joint Chiefs of Staff <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> submitted a U.S. Air Contingency Plan Berlin which has been reviewed and approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition, <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> has requested additional guidance in the following areas:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Recommendations for supplemental planning and implementation of subject plan including plan implementation date.</item>
<item>b.

<item>c. Degree and order of magnitude of U.S. limited military force (air) action authorized to counter Soviet and/or German Democratic Republic (<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) restrictions on U.S. air access to Berlin.
</item></list>
<p>3. In view of the implications concerning U.S. national security involved in the implementation of <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss>’s Air Contingency Plan, it is considered that the guidance to be provided <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> should be a final U.S. position.</p>
<p>4. In developing the final U.S. position, it is recommended that the Department of State be consulted. The following considerations and recommendations concerning implementing guidance are furnished:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Implementation of the testing of intentions phase of <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss>’s Air Contingency Plan will be made at an appropriate date which is advantageous to the United States in achieving its cold war objectives. An early date is recommended due to the recent advent of the C–130 aircraft into the European theater and the fact that any delay in the initiation of the proposed flights above 10,000 feet would only tend to weaken our position.</item>
<item>b. Based upon the introduction of turboprop type aircraft (C–130) into USAFE, the USSR, through the Berlin Air Safety Center, will be notified of contemplated flights into the Berlin corridors in excess of altitudes normally flown by propeller type aircraft. This notification will be made with sufficient advanced warning to provide the Soviets/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> an opportunity to revise their communications and air control procedures. The exact date of the initial flight would not be given, but they will be notified that after a specified date it is the intention of the United States to conduct flights within the Berlin air corridors as set forth above. However, the initial flights will be conducted under Visual Flight Rules. After initial visual nights, instrument flights above 10,000 feet will be initiated.</item>
<item>c. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5604 provides appropriate policy guidance on U.S. actions in the event of unprovoked Communist attack against U.S. aircraft. The proviso contained in subparagraph 4 (a) of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5604 is based on a situation in which a definite pattern of continued interference with or attacks on U.S. aircraft is encountered in areas outside Communist control. <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> should be governed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of the policy outlined in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5604 until Soviet or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> intentions have been disclosed and a pattern of substantial interference has been established.</item>
<item>d. The degree and order of magnitude of U.S. military air action in this situation is dependent upon the reaction of the Soviets and/or the German Democratic Republic. If the USSR and/or the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> were to establish a complete air blockade of the Berlin Air Corridors, full use of their jet fighters, anti-aircraft weapons, and electronic countermeasures might be required. Hostile acts of the magnitude required to establish a complete air blockade will indicate that general war is probably imminent and the action to be taken by <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> under such circumstances will be directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</item>
<item>e. <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> should be delegated the authority to determine the air effort appropriate to cope with possible contingencies other than a complete air blockade of the Berlin air corridors.</item>
<item>f. Supplemental planning should cover antiaircraft artillery (AAA) firing by the Soviet or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> on allied aircraft from positions</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_42" n="42" facs="0067"/>
<item>above ground located within or outside the corridor. It is considered that the Hot Pursuit policy contained in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5604 should be extended to include retaliatory action by combat aircraft against the AAA units concerned.</item>
</list>
<p>5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff request that they be informed of the final U.S. position at an early date.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, I do not think essential <gloss target="#t_USCOB1">USCOB</gloss> be given prior and unconditional authority undertake military action deal with any eventuality.

<p>As I see it, one constant factor is there really is no stable modus vivendi in Berlin. (This applies not only West Berlin itself but in equal measure West Berlin exclaves.) We are confronted by persistent Communist attempts undermine and erode our position there. Therefore think important we take firm position assure we cannot permit or facilitate by lack of preparation deliberate physical violation by Communists our positions whose [<hi rend="italic">in those</hi>] parts West Berlin and West Berlin exclaves for which we responsible.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> says it cannot recommend change in policy which would authorize counteractions “only after fact” but would be “particularly pleased hear any proposals which would improve situation before fact.”</p>
<p>Only proposal that might improve situation before fact would be to have it generally known that if incursion took place US armed force would be used to restore situation. Also we might assert our implicit right to overland access to exclave though this involves complex questions which no doubt Defense and State will wish to explore.</p>
<p>For all practical purposes our position Berlin is not such we can improve it fundamentally from military standpoint. Situation hardly conducive to that. However, we must do everything possible preserve our position by reacting promptly and effectively when it is jeopardized. Unless we are clearly prepared take prompt and effective actions, seems to me we inviting if not encouraging further Communist actions of increasingly serious character, especially since I think we must assume they are conscious of widespread doubts as to whether we have any settled policy regarding exercise of jurisdiction over exclaves.</p>
<p>With these considerations in mind I fully supported General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>’ first recommendation (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>). I therefore hope State and Defense will examine problem in this context.<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">In telegram 642, September 26, the Department replied to this telegram, stating that it intended to examine the problem in all its aspects but was awaiting the final views of the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Army in Europe.

<p>At his request Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> called on the Secretary today to discuss primarily the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> proposals (see separate memorandum of conversation).<note n="1" xml:id="d22fn1">No memorandum of this part of the conversation has been found; however, it was summarized in telegram 728 to Bonn, October 8.

(Telegram 697 to Bonn, October 10; Department of State, Central Files, 396.1/10–358)</note> to express this concern. What particularly bothered his Government was that, if there were to be any change in American plans involving, for example, withdrawal of forces from Quemoy, there might be unfavorable repercussions on our position in Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said that he had been satisfied with the explanations given by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, but would be glad to have the Secretary’s views on this subject.</p>
<p>The Secretary commented that Quemoy and Matsu were militarily indefensible, which was likewise the case with Berlin. Nevertheless, we were prepared to defend them. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> commented that this was much appreciated in Berlin. The Secretary continued that he would not conceal from the German Ambassador that, if American policy were to be dominated by those who tried to find excuses for falling back, and this became the general mood, the same school of thought might find itself in the same frame of mind about Berlin. Such a mood was contagious. This was one reason why the German Government should back American policy. Many columnists and other critics of our policy were prepared to fall back and back until they were all the way back home. No one who has an area to be defended by us should favor our falling back in the Far East. This would only encourage the very forces that would ask “Why <pb xml:id="pg_45" n="45" facs="0070"/>should we risk war over Berlin?” We are willing to take such a risk wherever the Communists are trying to invoke force in order to obtain something which they did not have before. The Allies must stand together on this. The Secretary referred to the recent <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> statement in Boston, to which he had alluded in his recent press conference,<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">For a transcript of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ press conference on September 30 and <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s address to the Atlantic Treaty Association in Boston on September 27, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> October 20, 1958, pp. 597–604 and 607–611.</note> stressing the need to stand together. It was therefore important, if the United States were expected to carry out its commitments in Berlin, that it not be urged to give way elsewhere.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said he could assure the Secretary that the American position had German Government support. In response to a query from the Secretary as to whether this had been made clear, <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said he was not certain. The Secretary emphasized that it would be helpful if the German Government could make its support clear. We would like to have something we could point to. Many critics of American policy have claimed that we have no support elsewhere in the free world. Hence, this was important. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said he would try to get something.</p>

<head>24. Editorial Note</head>
<p>On November 10 Soviet Premier and First Party Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Nikita S. Khrushchev</persName> addressed a friendship meeting of the peoples of the Soviet Union and Poland at the Sports Palace in Moscow. During this address, he stated that because of their violations of the Potsdam Agreement, the Western Allies had forfeited their legal basis to remain in Berlin. The Premier declared that the time had come for the powers that signed the Potsdam Agreement to give up the remnants of the occupation regime in Berlin, and to that end the Soviet Union would hand over to the German Democratic Republic those functions that the Soviet Government still exercised in Berlin. In concluding <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> called upon the Western Allies to establish their own relations with East Germany if they were interested in questions connected with Berlin. An extract of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s address is printed in <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985,</hi> pages 542–546.</p>
<p>The immediate response to this address was made by Department of State spokesman Lincoln White on the same day when he stated that none of the four powers could walk out on the occupation agreement on its own, and reiterated that the three Western powers were prepared to fight, if necessary, to defend West Berlin’s freedom. A copy of White’s statement is in Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/11–1058.</p>

(Department of State, Central Files, 601.62B49/11–1358)</note></p>
<p>Threat to end quadripartite status Berlin appears to have been deliberately stated in equivocal manner and may be only trial balloon. Difficult to see, however, how Soviets could simply let matter drop particularly in view coordinated action of East German note and memorandum. I therefore consider that speech represents a most dangerous move on part of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. It is true that this is only one of a number of recent indications of hardening of Soviet policy which appears to be aiming at deliberate increase of tension and in that respect may be less serious than if German question alone were singled out for maximum pressure.</p>
<p>It is probable that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has several motives in pursuing this general hard line. One may be that having failed to secure summit meeting by soft approach he intends to force meeting by building up tension to almost intolerable pitch. If this is primary motive, however, German problem is ill chosen since this is the one of two problems Soviets refuse to discuss with US. I believe that more likely explanation of general Soviet policy is that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has concluded that he cannot achieve his objectives by top level negotiations with present American administration and that he intends to see what effect strong pressure and heightened tension will have on cohesion of Western powers. We may expect that such pressure will as usual alternate with friendly gestures and declarations of sweet reasonableness.</p>
<p>A further reason for deliberate heightening of tension may be that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> considers this will serve his personal objectives at 21st Party Congress.<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">The 21st Party Congress met at Moscow, January 27–February 5, 1959.</note> German Ambassador thinks this is so but that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> fails realize that other members of Presidium are already <pb xml:id="pg_48" n="48" facs="0073"/>worried by his tendency to take unnecessary risks in field foreign affairs. [<hi rend="italic">8-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p>So far as the German question itself is concerned <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> clearly is aiming at forcing our recognition in some form of the East German regime. I believe he sees that with the completion in the next few years of West German rearmament, including the stationing of atomic weapons there, the position of the East German regime will become even more precarious and he fears that West German intervention in an East German revolt under such circumstances might face the Soviet Union with the choice of almost certain world war or the loss of East Germany and subsequently of most or all of his satellite empire. Having failed to maneuver the West into at least tacit recognition of the status quo in Eastern Europe through summit talks he feels compelled to resolve this issue now before West German rearmament is completed. An added factor is the failure of the East German regime to win any popular support and the dilemma the Soviets face in attempting to carry out a Stalinist policy in the rest of Eastern Europe, and in Poland in particular, so long as the East German situation is so unstable.</p>
<p>German Ambassador thinks that speech will undoubtedly change character of German note to Soviet Government<note n="4" xml:id="d25fn4">For text of the West German note on the reunification of Germany as delivered on November 17, see <hi rend="italic">Moskau Bonn,</hi> p. 459.</note> but doubts that this was important consideration in Soviet action. His general conclusion is that we are moving from a diplomatic war of position into one of manoeuvre and he agrees with me that this faces us with an exceedingly dangerous situation.</p>
<p>I shall submit shortly comments on possible U.S. actions to counter latest Soviet moves.<note n="5" xml:id="d25fn5">In telegram 1058 the following day, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> suggested that in the absence of a prompt tripartite reply to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech on Berlin the United States should make its own response in the form of a statement by the President or Secretary of State making it unmistakably clear that the United States would defend its rights in Berlin. This should be coupled with a vigorous propaganda campaign against the German Democratic Republic. In any serious private conversations with the Soviet Union, however, the United States should recognize the problem that the Soviets had created for themselves by setting up the East German regime and stress its willingness to take this into account in a settlement of the German problem.

<p>320. Bonn pass <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss> and USAFE. Paris pass <gloss target="#t_Topol1">Topol</gloss>. Following is mission reaction to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech:</p>
<p>Speech seems to aim at several objectives, but only Berlin situation appropriate for our comment. We see as most important point in this part of speech a warning directed primarily to US, UK and France to <pb xml:id="pg_50" n="50" facs="0075"/>recognize <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or face increasing pressure on access to Berlin This theme is not new, but when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> says it, presumably Soviets have moved close to, and if not all the way to, a decision to implement it.</p>
<p>Soviet objectives in trying to force allied recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> well known. There is objective in connection their German reunification policy. There is also fact that if allies can be forced into even de facto recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, basis on which allies occupy Berlin would be seriously undermined. Furthermore de facto recognition would give Communists improved stranglehold on allied access and place them in better position try to force eventual allied de jure recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> position. De jure recognition tantamount to official signing away our rights to occupy Berlin.</p>
<p>We think a key sentence re Berlin situation is that which reads: “For its part, Soviet Union will transfer to sovereign <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> those functions in Berlin which are now handled by Soviet organs.” We interpret “will” to mean “are going to, whether other three powers do or not” rather than “would if other three powers will.” From other passages in speech we conclude that “Berlin” is intended to include access thereto. Soviets have already in theory abolished occupation in Soviet zone, except for allied access which is under administrative controls of Berlin Kommandatura.</p>
<p>We have every reason believe Soviets take very seriously our security guarantee Berlin. We anticipate that turn over to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be implemented gradually, and though <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> pressure would be applied in stages, avoid any action which Communists think would bring into force our security guarantee. Gradual implementation would also presumably offer advantage of enabling Communists to test us from time to time to determine how much more pressure they think would be needed to force us to come to terms with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>It appears to us, therefore, that in forseeable future East Germans may appear in place of Soviets at the several access checkpoints—more likely on surface routes at first than at Berlin air safety center. Also, at first, East Germans may pass allied official travellers with same documentation and formalities as Soviets do now. Our standing instructions are to accept this arrangement under protest.</p>
<p>As time goes on, however, we think screws will be tightened. Perhaps next step would be <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> effort try to stamp <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> visa on allied travel documents. Under our standing instructions, we refuse accept <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> visa. Should we at this point decide not impose on ourselves a surface blockade, we would in final analysis have to be prepared reopen access at gunpoint.</p>
<p>If we do permit <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> visas to be stamped on allied travel documents, next Communist step might be to require that allied official <pb xml:id="pg_51" n="51" facs="0076"/>travellers obtain their <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> visas in advance of travel at <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Foreign Office. This would put Communists in position to deny transit travel when they chose. And so on.</p>
<p>It hard for us believe that after experience of 1948–49 Communists would not try to interfere with air traffic, although here we are better situated to contend with interference. Most likely first step in this direction appears to us to be substitution East Germans for Soviet controller <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>. Our standing instructions are to usher East Germans out. We continue to fly without Communist “flight safety guarantee” and onus is on them to fire first shot if they are in earnest in trying to stop us.</p>
<p>Mission is not in position to judge how far Communists might go in employing force to implement access harassment. We would observe, however, that in the air they would be the aggressors and the security guarantees should give them pause before they employ force to try to stop flights. On surface access they might maneuver us into a seemingly “aggressor” position, but even the Communists must be aware that dialections [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of this sort are not going to affect our decision to implement the security guarantee if we think such action necessary. Since it would be the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> rather than the Soviet Union which would be faced with implementation of access harassment by force, failure to do so would presumably not involve the same prestige considerations for Communist world as would be case were Soviet forces directly involved. And the Communists might feel resultant loss of prestige to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> could to some extent be offset by propaganda blasts to effect that three Western powers have committed armed aggression against small but sovereign <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> all because they would not accept a visa.</p>
<p>Until Soviets do take action there is opportunity for solemn warning to Soviets at high levels of the serious consequences that would ensue were they to implement <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s threat. We feel that contact with Karlshorst on this matter would be waste of time and possibly counter-productive.</p>
<p>We believe status US military liaison mission Potsdam will continue to be decided in future as it has presumably been decided in past—i.e., on considerations having nothing to do with allied position Berlin, such as benefits Soviets consider they derive from having Soviet <gloss target="#t_MLM1">MLM</gloss> in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Above comments based on German text <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech <hi rend="italic">Neues Deutschland.</hi> We are conscious of inherent defects in any translation and will be happy if our reading of speech to effect Soviets have probably decided to turn over access control to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is shown to be wrong.</p>

Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said that he was carrying out instructions received from his Foreign Office on Monday to approach the Department at the highest possible level to express the deep concern of the Federal Government at the implications of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statement.<note n="1" xml:id="d28fn1">Late on November 10 German Counselor Pauls informed the Department of State that <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> had been instructed by the Foreign Ministry to express “at high level” the Federal Republic’s concern over <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> sent Pauls instead, who was informed that there was no need for panic, and that the Embassy would be informed as the situation developed.

<p>After his conversation with the Acting Secretary (covered in a separate memorandum of conversation),<note n="1" xml:id="d29fn1">See <ref target="#d28">Document 28</ref>.</note> Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> went with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> to the latter’s office to continue the discussion of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statement on Berlin made in Moscow on November 10. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> stated that, as the Acting Secretary had mentioned, we were considering the possibility of further action by the Western three powers, and also whether it might not be desirable to have some later confirmatory action by all the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries at the December ministerial meeting in Paris.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> commented that this would be in line with the parallel action taken by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries after the tripartite statement on Berlin issued at the London Conference in 1954.<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">For text of the tripartite declaration, see section V of the Final Act of the Nine-Power Conference in <ref target="frus1952-54v05p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1952–1954, vol. V, Part 2</ref>, pp. 1352–1354.</note></p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> then reviewed in some detail the views of our Ambassador in Moscow contained in the Embassy’s telegram No. 1052 of November 11.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3"><ref target="#d25">Document 25</ref>.</note> He added that we agree this is potentially a dangerous situation but it would be even more dangerous if we did not all show a firm and united front in face of the threat. Hence the desirability of considering some form of tripartite action to be confirmed by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in December. A ringing treatment of the subject in a communiqué would be one way of doing this.</p>
<p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName>’s question as to the reactions of other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said he did not expect there would be much deviation from the common position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> commented that under normal circumstances they might be expected to favor such common action, but the present circumstances were not normal and we were accordingly interested in how they might be expected to react. Dr. <pb xml:id="pg_54" n="54" facs="0079"/><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> noted that failure to mention Berlin in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué might lead to misunderstanding. He had received no word from his Government as to what it anticipated might Happen next, but he could conceive that the Soviets might turn over their remaining functions in East Berlin to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, or turn over to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials their functions at the border checkpoints. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> commented that there were, of course, tripartite plans to meet various possible contingencies. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> indicated that he was not too familiar with how much the German Government might be informed of Allied planning in Bonn in this connection.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> then went on to make the point that the Soviet contention the Allies were in Berlin on the basis of the Potsdam Agreement should be rejected. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> said we were giving thought to the possibility of a statement on this subject.<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4"><persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> also talked with <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> about the Berlin situation along these lines on November 12. A summary of their conversation was transmitted to Paris in telegram 1739, November 13. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/11–1158)</note></p>

<p>323. From <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trimble</persName>. Accompanied by <persName corresp="#p_BFJ1">Burns</persName> and Muller I called on Mayors <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> this morning. I said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> presumably had several objectives in mind in making statement re Germany: raise stature <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, enhance world tension, probe allied determination re Berlin, weaken Western cohesion, etc. In circumstances it essential West should not be alarmed or permit any weakening its unity. Our power posture greater than that of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s and latter aware this.</p>
<p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> expressed his gratitude for my assurances. He especially pleased Secretary’s Nov 7 and press officer White’s Nov 11 statements.<note n="1" xml:id="d30fn1">Regarding White’s statement, see <ref target="#d24">Document 24</ref>; regarding Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ press conference on November 7, see <ref target="#d23">Document 23</ref>.</note> He analyzed situation from two points of view: (1) as far as <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> <pb xml:id="pg_55" n="55" facs="0080"/>concerned, East Germans have impression they were driving force behind <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s move. Reportedly, senior <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials had conferred with <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PMG1">Pervukhin</persName> and were assured of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> support in campaign against West Berlin. East German initiative designed (a) provoke shock in zone to reduce number of refugees by dramatizing instability Berlin position casting doubt on ability of refugees escape via West Berlin because prospect Commies would force cessation commercial flights; (b) shake economic stability of West Berlin to reduce investments and bring about cancellation industry orders; (c) possible belief that <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> vote might be increased by capitalizing on desire of people to “reinsure” themselves.</p>
<p>(2) As far as <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> motives concerned <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably wanted determine whether Berlin was soft spot in Western front and may have underrated strength and promptness Western reaction. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said yesterday’s <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Grotewohl</persName> statement<note n="2" xml:id="d30fn2">At his press conference on November 12, Minister President <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Otto Grotewohl</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech was designed to serve as a basis for further discussion and that both the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Soviet Union were ready to examine the agreement under which Soviet troops were stationed in East Germany. The Mission in Berlin commented that the tone of the statement was “reasonable” and “cautious” and that it appeared <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Grotewohl</persName> had been ordered to “damp down” the reaction to the speech. (Telegram 319, November 12; Department of State, Central Files, 862B.00/11–1258)</note> was significant since he referred to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> “proposal” rather than “announcement.” He nevertheless felt situation re access Western powers was serious in event replacement <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> control personnel at autobahn by East Germans in which case Western powers presumably have to accept <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control or embark on self-blockade unless they were prepared use force which <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> doubted.</p>
<p>He also stated that East Germans had capability of severing connections between two parts of city but such action would not seriously interfere with economic life West Berlin as long as transport goods continued. A much greater danger was likelihood East Germans would start with minor steps none of which would seem worth a strong reaction but cumulative effect of which would be strangulation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> then suggested (1) approach by three Western powers in Moscow as outlined by <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> (<gloss target="#t_ourtel1">ourtel</gloss> 269 to Bonn, 316 Dept)<note n="3" xml:id="d30fn3">Telegram 316, November 11, reported on a meeting of the three Western Deputy Commandants with <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> at which the latter proposed two possible steps with regard to Berlin: (1) joint call by the three Western Ambassadors on <persName corresp="#p_PMG1">Pervukhin</persName> to reaffirm the four-power status of Berlin, or (2) joint Western démarche in Moscow stating that the Allies would not tolerate any changes that would affect their position in West Berlin. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221/11–1158)</note> and (2) consideration be given to advisability of sending several Americans of national stature to Berlin not unduly to dramatize situation but rather as proof continuing interest U.S. Govt and people in Berlin. In response <pb xml:id="pg_56" n="56" facs="0081"/>to my question whom <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> had in mind he replied leading representatives both parties such as Messrs. Rockefeller and Stevenson.</p>
<p>I assured <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> that his first suggestion had already been forwarded to Dept and that we would bring second its attention.</p>
<p>I opened meeting with <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> with same remarks as made to <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> said he especially gratified with U.S. statement which headlined by West Berlin press today that 600 planes ready for another airlift; he felt this all that could be asked by way of clarification our position to population West Berlin and to Kremlin. <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> felt entire East “offensive against Berlin well planned strategy and that motives internal politics, such as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s desire fortify his position prior 21st CP USSR Congress, secondary. He emphasized <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had not spoken of “decisions” and that therefore there was time take steps against implementation his threats.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> also raised problem West rail and road access and said there was no indication that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s might propose using <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel as their agents at control points but that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech pointed to direct transfer these functions to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as sovereign state. Remarking that previous <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> measures such as imposition autobahn and waterway tolls should not have been tolerated, <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> emphasized he felt Allies should accept no <gloss target="#t_Vopo1">Vopo</gloss> control of traffic to West Berlin garrisons. Decision might have to be taken by Allies to proceed without submitting East German controls.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> then suggested time might be ripe consider new stockpile discussions, and resumption contacts with Berlin officials on this matter.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> informed his suggestion re Berlin conference three Ambassadors considered but in view already existing plans myself and British Ambassador come to Berlin independently, it felt that same purpose could be accomplished individual Rathaus calls on our part. If shortly after this three chiefs of mission were to revisit Berlin together, psychological effect might be counter-productive. <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> agreed.</p>

<p>622. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated November 10 that USSR “will hand over to sovereign <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> those functions in Berlin which are still reserved for Soviet organs” and will consider an “attack on the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as an attack on the Soviet Union.” This intimation of Soviet withdrawal from Berlin is accompanied by sharp and extensive attacks on West German “militarization” and aggressive intentions in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GW1">Gomulka</persName> speeches and Soviet-Polish communiqué and <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Grotewohl</persName> press conference November 12,<note n="1" xml:id="d31fn1">The text of the joint Soviet-Polish declaration of November 12, 1958, is printed in <hi rend="italic">Pravda,</hi> November 12, 1958.

These pronouncements and publications may presage broad Soviet diplomatic and propaganda offensive on German problem but hint of Soviet action is cautiously advanced and Soviet intentions are not yet clear.</p>
<p>USSR may be pursuing one or more of following objectives:</p>
<list>
<item>1. Testing resolve and unity of will of US, UK and France to maintain their position in Berlin;</item>
<item>2. Forcing Western Powers into de facto recognition of East German regime through creation of situations on Allied access routes to Berlin calculated compel Western Powers deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials;</item>

<item>4. Bringing about withdrawal of Western troops from Western Germany;</item>
<item>5. Bringing pressure for Four-Power talks on German peace treaty and talks between “two German states” on reunification;</item>
<item>6. In line with Communist pattern of behavior re Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, representing Western occupation of Berlin, special regime of Western Powers’ access to Berlin, and influence exerted by Berlin on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as unjustified interference with internal German affairs;</item>
<item>7. Generating intensive and continuous pressures throughout world in order divide Western Powers.</item>
</list>
<p>Following furnished for information and as background for replying questions about <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s statements.</p>
<p>In discussing subject addressees should not convey impression excitement or undue anxiety. Should point out Communist threats against <pb xml:id="pg_58" n="58" facs="0083"/>Berlin frequently made but not often implemented and whether and how latest threat will be implemented will depend greatly on firmness of Western reaction.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s basic argumentation re Berlin is not new and is essentially repetition line Soviets took as early as 1948. Most significant aspect is more explicit statement by highest Soviet official of threat Soviets have occasionally made by implication earlier, namely to relinquish and thus in effect cede to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> remaining responsibilities re Berlin which Soviets continue exercise on basis quadripartite agreements and arrangements.</p>
<p>No doubt Soviets desire withdrawal of Western Powers from Berlin and incorporation of all Berlin into Communist-controlled area. However they have been deterred from attempting accomplish this objective forcibly by experience of 1948–49 blockade, by realization world opinion would be adverse, and by explicit guarantee of Western Powers to maintain Berlin’s status and security at all costs. Though we do not discount threat implicit in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech and are fully prepared take all necessary action counter implementation of this threat, we regard speech at least in part as probing attempt in war of nerves and as propaganda statement. Following considerations may help explain why <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> made this threat at this time.</p>
<p>Soviets continue thwart any progress towards German reunification and establishment peace and security in Europe. Majority of world opinion undoubtedly blames them for lack of solutions. German problem too pressing for Soviets to ignore it and they are therefore seeking becloud real issues and disguise own intransigence with distortions, threats, and invective. Misrepresentation of situations in Federal Republic and West Berlin are no doubt part of attempt to divert attention from Soviet responsibility re German problem and from situation in Soviet Zone as well as attempt find pretexts for further repression in Zone and excuses for shortcomings of Soviet Zone regime.</p>
<p>Statements by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and East German Communists probably also occasioned in part by so-called “Volkskammer elections” to take place in Soviet Zone November 16. On this day unwilling and hostile population will be disciplined and humiliated by being obliged, with over 99 per cent majority, cast ballots in support of regime in parody of democratic process. Objective is to demonstrate to population it must riot only accept regime but must willy-nilly approve it. Such occasion naturally calls for vigorous beating of propaganda drums. One is inevitably reminded of Nazi election tactics.</p>
<p>West Berlin elections scheduled December 7 may also have been taken into consideration in Communist statements. Communists are participating in these genuinely democratic elections. At time last elections in 1954 Communists subjected Berlin population to many psychological <pb xml:id="pg_59" n="59" facs="0084"/>pressures to increase Communist vote but obtained only little over 2 per cent of vote cast. Similar pressures may be expected in connection this year’s election, but repudiation of Communism by electorate also expected to be similarly emphatic.</p>
<p>Commentaries on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s remarks indicate it would be appropriate clarify basis of Allied presence in Berlin. Western Powers’ right remain in Berlin and have free access to Berlin do not derive from Potsdam Protocol. Western Powers are in Berlin as military occupiers, with right of occupation based on defeat of Nazi Germany. Areas of occupation were fixed by Protocol of European Advisory Commission concluded London 1944.<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">For the Protocol of the European Advisory Commission, signed September 12, 1944, at London, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> The Conferences of Malta and Yalta, 1945, pp. 118–121.</note> Status of Berlin as area under joint occupation and separate from other occupation zones was formally reiterated in statement issued by Four Governments June 5, 1945.<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> June 10, 1945, p. 1052.</note> Right of access derives from right of occupation and is confirmed by numerous quadripartite agreements and arrangements. Rights of Western Powers were challenged by Soviets in 1948, but Soviets were forced to back down after failure of blockade. Rights of Western Powers confirmed not only by New York agreement of May 4, 1949 and Paris communiqué of June 20, 1949<note n="4" xml:id="d31fn4">For texts of the May 4 and June 20, 1949 agreements, see <ref target="frus1949v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 751 and 1062–1065.</note> which restored status quo ante blockade but also by continuous practice since.</p>
<p>Postwar history of Germany replete with charges and countercharges about violation of Potsdam agreements, but it is clear that accomplishment of essential purpose of occupation, creation of united democratic Germany, has been frustrated by actions of Soviets themselves. Communist statements attempt obscure historic facts. Soviet imperialism is responsible for insecurity in Europe which has led free European nations, including Federal Republic, to strengthen military defense and to request continued presence of American forces. Soviet attempts establish new totalitarian regime, with same disregard of human dignity and the values of civilization shown by the Nazi regime, are mockery of original purposes of occupation and constant obstacle to building firm foundation for peace in Europe.</p>
<p>Western position re Soviet attempts frustrate establishment democracy in Germany and reunification Germany in peace and freedom is well known. Western Powers have consistently maintained Soviets cannot unilaterally divest selves of responsibilities undertaken in quadripartite agreements, for example, by asserting problems come within jurisdiction of so-called German Democratic Republic. Following so-called <pb xml:id="pg_60" n="60" facs="0085"/>USSR–<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> agreements of September 20, 1955,<note n="5" xml:id="d31fn5">For text of the treaty signed at Moscow on September 20, 1955, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985,</hi> pp. 458–460.</note> which purported to give “sovereignty” to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, Western Powers informed USSR “These agreements cannot affect in any respect and in any way obligations or responsibilities of USSR under agreements and arrangements on subject of Germany, including Berlin, previously concluded between France, US, UK and USSR,” and that, in particular, agreements “cannot have effect of discharging USSR from responsibilities which it has assumed in matters concerning transportation and communications between the different parts of Germany, including Berlin”.</p>
<p>Seriousness with which Western Powers would view any attempt force them from Berlin is reflected in October 3, 1954 declaration of Foreign Ministers of US, UK, and France, which has been frequently reaffirmed (most recently by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in Berlin May 8, 1958)<note n="6" xml:id="d31fn6">See <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> which reads:</p>
<list><item>“Security and welfare of Berlin and maintenance of position of Three Powers there are regarded by Three Powers as essential elements of peace of free would in present international situation. Accordingly, they will maintain armed forces within territory of Berlin as long as their responsibilities require it.

<p rend="center">A STATUS REPORT ON BERLIN IN THE LIGHT OF THE KHRUSHCHEV STATEMENT OF NOVEMBER 10</p>
<p>The <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statement on Berlin has naturally caused concern in Berlin and West Germany. Newspapers carried the story in banner headlines. Editorial reactions were, however, generally moderate and cool-headed; they expressed confidence in Western guarantees to Berlin and interpreted the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statement as a move in the war of nerves, possibly connected with the coming East German and Berlin elections, rather than as a prelude to the actual withdrawal of U.S.S.R. authorities from Berlin or to drastic harassment of the city. The Berlin population has so far reacted in a similar unhysterical fashion. Berlin officials have called upon the Three Powers to demonstrate as effectively as possible the determination of the Three Powers to honor their Berlin commitments.</p>
<p>Although we have heard the reactions of one working-level Foreign Office official we do not yet know the views of Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> or Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> called on the Under Secretary on November 12<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2">See <ref target="#d28">Document 28</ref>.</note> to express the deep concern of the Federal Government at the implications of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statement.</p>
<p>Although there are a variety of speculations regarding Soviet motivation this action seems clearly related to a long-standing Soviet desire to force the Western Powers into de facto recognition of an East German regime through the creation of situations on allied access routes to Berlin calculated to compel the Western Powers to deal with East German officials.</p>
<p>The Department in public statements is emphasizing our quadripartite responsibilities in Berlin and the unacceptability of Soviet unilateral abrogation of specific quadrilateral agreements on Berlin (other than the Potsdam Agreement which is not pertinent to our position in Berlin).</p>
<p>Consideration is being given to the desirability of some tripartite reaffirmation of the Western position on Berlin. There is, however, some difference of view as to whether this would be useful at the present time. The British and Germans at the working level believe it would demonstrate our nervousness more than our determination and we think it advisable to wait at least a few days to see how the situation develops before issuing a tripartite statement. This is in line with our belief that <pb xml:id="pg_62" n="62" facs="0087"/>our wisest course is to avoid actions which might over-dramatize the present situation.</p>
<p>We are reviewing our contingency planning on Berlin in case the Soviet Union carries out <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s threat to our position in Berlin.</p>

<p>1080. In meeting with British and French Ambassadors this morning re <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech we agreed as follows. We consider most likely reason for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> action was concern over weakening internal situation in East Germany together with strengthening particularly in military field of West Germany. We disagree with German Ambassador’s estimate that motive was <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s desire to strengthen his position at 21st Party Congress.<note n="1" xml:id="d33fn1">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kroll</persName>’s views, see <ref target="#d25">Document 25</ref>.</note> We do not see that he has need for such tactics nor likelihood that this action would in fact strengthen his position. (<persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kroll</persName> agrees with latter point but thinks <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has miscalculated.) We are all three baffled by what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may expect to accomplish by this maneuver. There is possibility that he may have so misjudged Western reaction that he thinks he can get away with it. We are more inclined to think he has some subsequent step in mind after having built up tension to very dangerous point. We think one possibility may be that he has changed his estimate that a settlement of German problem could be put off indefinitely and that he is aiming at a summit meeting, possibly without an agenda other than to deal with threat to peace. I suggested this approach might enable him to get around commitment which he has undoubtedly made to East Germans not to discuss German problem on four power basis.</p>
<p>We were generally agreed that a firm warning to Soviet Govt is necessary and that this should probably be made on a confidential basis. I expressed personal opinion that the problem was whether or not we should make clear that we would be prepared to use force to maintain <pb xml:id="pg_63" n="63" facs="0088"/>land, particularly road, communications. I said I deplored talk of resumption airlift since appeared to me that if Soviets thought we would settle on such a basis they would be encouraged to push ahead. We would then be saddled with airlift indefinitely and East Germans would then be in position to take measures to weaken or at least bring strong pressure on West Berlin. Believe my colleagues were impressed by this argument.</p>
<p>We also agreed that would be advisable to reiterate our willingness to discuss German question on four power basis. I suggest this offer be made publicly possibly in connection with publication German note. Appears to me that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech makes it all the more important that German note be a firm one.<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">See <ref target="#d25fn4">footnote 4, Document 25</ref>.</note></p>

<p>1037. Reference <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 987.<note n="1" xml:id="d34fn1">Telegram 987, November 13, reported that the Department was considering reiterating the tripartite declaration of 1954 on Berlin and asked that this idea be discussed in the quadripartite meetings at Bonn. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/11–1358)</note> After meeting this morning with British and French Counselors we met this afternoon with their Ambassadors at French request.<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> left Bonn November 6 for consultations in Washington; he returned to Germany November 21.</note></p>
<p>Regarding possible tripartite declaration or démarche Moscow, British strongly opposed both. They consider that statements already made have amply shown firmness our position, that things now calmed down somewhat, that <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Grotewohl</persName> speech<note n="3" xml:id="d34fn3">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Grotewohl</persName>’s press statement of November 12; see <ref target="#d30fn2">footnote 2, Document 30</ref>.</note> indicated slight retreat, and <pb xml:id="pg_64" n="64" facs="0089"/>that in any event démarche Moscow might prove tactical error by evoking reply “formalizing” statements in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech. French Ambassador, although instructed by Paris discuss possibility of démarche, agreed with British it better leave things where they are pending further developments. We also inclined agree.</p>
<p>Other points French instructed discuss were (1) exact nature difficulties Soviets may create and (2) possible Western retaliations. On (1) it agreed that foreseeable eventualities already pretty well covered in tripartite paper on surface access to Berlin (Embdesp 1075 December 18, 1957)<note n="4" xml:id="d34fn4">Despatch 1075 transmitted the “Policy on Travel In and Through Soviet Zone of Germany (<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) Including Travel To and From Berlin.” (Department of State, Central Files, 862B.181/12–1857)</note> and in tripartite instructions to <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> (Berlin’s 315 to Department<note n="5" xml:id="d34fn5">Telegram 315, November 11, reported that the three Western powers had agreed not to allow East German controllers into <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>, and in the event that the Soviets withdrew from participation in it, to continue to file flight plans in the normal manner. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221/11–1158)</note> —British and French comments on these instructions in separate telegram<note n="6" xml:id="d34fn6">Not found in Department of State files.</note>).</p>
<p>British expressed view that any moves were apt to be against Allied access to Berlin rather than German. If Allied surface travel cut off and even if commercial air travel also stopped, they suggested, it should be possible for three powers to mount almost immediately “little airlift” to supply Berlin garrisons and provide transport for at least official travel. They thought cost and effort of this would not be great and that it would put Soviets and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in disadvantageous position. We suggested “little airlift” might have to be expanded to cover at least some civilian travel also if commercial airlines unable fly. It was agreed ask governments consider idea and what if any advance planning necessary.</p>
<p>On possible retaliations, it agreed essential press Germans join in economic countermeasures, especially re steel deliveries. British also reverted to idea put forward their paper on countermeasures (Embdesp 1865 April 14),<note n="7" xml:id="d34fn7">This eight-paragraph report suggested countermeasures that could be taken inside and out of Germany, stressed that they must be taken by all the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers as well, and explored how they might be introduced. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/4–1458)</note> about refusing visas to Soviets, and suggested that if three powers and Federal Republic, as well perhaps as all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, agreed such refusal, it would have strong impact. In reply question whether UK really likely be willing do this, British Ambassador said he believed so since idea had emanated from Foreign Office.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_65" n="65" facs="0090"/>
<p>Desirability of discussing practically all of foregoing with Germans on confidential basis was agreed and meeting now set with Northe tomorrow (Saturday) morning.<note n="8" xml:id="d34fn8"><p>At 5 p.m. on November 14 the Embassy in London also reported that the British opposed either reiteration of the 1954 declaration on Berlin or a private démarche in Moscow.

<p>Despite British opposition, the three Western powers met with the West Germans on November 15 and in a conversation characterized as “somewhat confused” and “inconclusive” it was agreed to propose that the North Atlantic Council discuss the desirability of some tripartite declaration.

Possible widespread dismay might be caused among Germans if we automatically apply agreed formula dating back to 1954 without informing them fully.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Section I of Policy Paper enclosed with reference despatch should (with tripartite concurrence) be discussed at appropriately <pb xml:id="pg_66" n="66" facs="0091"/>high level with <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss> soonest, with strong caution concerning sensitivity of information. Berlin follow same procedure to inform <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>. Stress should be placed on fact that these contingency plans, drawn up under High Commission and kept under review since, represent realistic attempt to adjust to possible new situations, on basis implied agency function of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials but stop short of action recognizing <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> controls as sovereign right.</p>
<p>We are also concerned that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries might misunderstand application agreed formula. However, security considerations probably make undesirable volunteer any discussion of subject in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> unless raised by others or until it becomes apparent contingency planning will be put in effect. Hence propose mention contingency planning only in response to specific inquiries such as made by Italian Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Brosio</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> November 13.<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4">A memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName>’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Brosio</persName> is in Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/11–1358.</note> During general discussion Berlin situation (memorandum of conversation being pouched all addressee posts) <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Brosio</persName> asked how far we prepared to go in contact with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials. It was explained that there has been considerable Allied contingency planning to meet various theoretical situations which might arise on Allied access routes. We would continue insist on ultimate Soviet responsibility, regarding <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials as essentially agents of Soviets. Obviously difficult problems involved in determining how far we can go in any given situation.</p>
<p>Concept of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials acting as agents of Soviets was spelled out in earlier versions of contingency plans. We have noted failure to make specific reference to agency concept in latest Policy Paper but assume changed wording did not derive from abandonment of usefulness of concept for public purposes.</p>
<p>Embassy Bonn should immediately work out tripartitely agreed statement for release to press and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> at moment it becomes necessary put contingency plans into operation.</p>

<p>1794. Re <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1743; <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1787.<note n="1" xml:id="d36fn1">Telegram 1743 is the same as telegram 987 to Bonn, see <ref target="#d34fn1">footnote 1, Document 34</ref>. In telegram 1787, November 14, <persName corresp="#p_LCB1">Lyon</persName> reported French views on Berlin along the lines indicated in the following paragraphs. (Department of State, Central Files, 762A.00/11–1458)</note></p>
<p>1. As indicated <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1787 Daridan has told us Fr prepared issue strong joint statement on Berlin situation, subject to <gloss target="#t_GER1">Ger</gloss> acquiescence. Working level at <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>, however (<persName corresp="#p_LJ1">Laloy</persName>, Jurgensen), continues feel that, from tactical point of view, public tripartite statement would probably be inadvisable at present juncture. They note all three capitals have already taken firm public position on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s threats and they are inclined believe that tripartite statement would appear repetitious as well as needlessly provocative at moment when crisis atmosphere appears have receded somewhat. Jurgensen expressed to us yesterday view that, if joint action to be taken vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s, it would be preferable do so through confidential, concerted approaches by <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>s in Moscow. He also thought idea of public tripartite statement could be held in abeyance for possible use at later time.</p>
<p>2. With regard to possible statement by <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> or President concerning Berlin, Jurgensen felt this would be excellent, but stated emphatically Fr would appreciate being consulted in advance re such statement. Jurgensen pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s interest in tripartite consultation obviously made such action advisable.<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">Documentation on <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s interest in tripartite (U.S.-U.K.-France) consultations on world problems is in volume VII, Part 1.</note></p>
<p>3. Re possibility of Berlin airlift, Jurgensen said Fr recently received revised plans for Allied airlift, which at first glance seemed satisfactory to <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>. He noted “pressure now on” to obtain official Fr Govt approval these plans. Jurgensen said that, although would be difficult for Fr to find very many transport planes for Berlin (bulk of Fr aircraft being tied up in Algeria), Fr would wish participate in greater measure than in 1948 if new airlift becomes necessary.</p>
<p>4. <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> has shown us instruction to Fr <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss> <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> for discussion in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Nov 17 on Berlin. Instructions not yet approved by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> but are expected be cleared without difficulty. Instructions recapitulate Fr views outlined in <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> background statement (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1750)<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">Telegram 1750, November 12, described a French background statement on Berlin, issued November 11, which noted that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s threats, if implemented, would cause a very serious crisis, and that the Soviet Premier did not seem correctly informed on the Berlin question. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/11–1258)</note> re basis of Fr presence in Berlin, and stress desirability of strongest <pb xml:id="pg_68" n="68" facs="0093"/>possible unity on Berlin, not only among three powers directly concerned but on part all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members. Fr expect that <gloss target="#t_GER1">Ger</gloss>s and US will take lead in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussion, but Fr <gloss target="#t_rep1">Rep</gloss> is instructed give them strong support.</p>
<p>5. Working level officials have expressed view, also reflected in instructions to Fr <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> <gloss target="#t_rep1">Rep</gloss>, that there is “division of labor” between <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> re Berlin and <gloss target="#t_GER1">Ger</gloss> situation. <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s, according this theory, are to concentrate on Berlin and quadripartite status, etc., while <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> <gloss target="#t_rep1">rep</gloss>s will concentrate on overall question, peace treaty, and so on.</p>
<p>Fr believe this may be explanation of alleged “discrepancy” between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s tough line on Berlin and failure of <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Grotewohl</persName> to press Berlin question.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Topol1">Topol</gloss> 1669. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech of November 10 launching idea of Western evacuation Berlin was clearly made in the face of full knowledge of basic agreements relating to status of Berlin and of clear tripartite commitment to defend Berlin. It was thus in itself a menace of aggression against a known position. When it provoked the reaction in Western capitals which had to be forthcoming <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in his second speech of November 14<note n="1" xml:id="d37fn1">For text of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech on November 14, in which he stated that the Soviet Government would prepare an appropriate document on the status of Berlin, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda,</hi> November 15, 1958, pp. 1–2.</note> followed the Soviet tactic of developing the position that Western resistance to change in Berlin would be “aggressive.” This parallels current Soviet revolutionary theory expressed by Suslov<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">Mikhail Andreevich Suslov, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.</note> at 20th Congress CPSU as follows:</p>

<list><item>...<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">Ellipsis in the source text.</note>Communists and the working class naturally prefer more painless forms of transition from one social system to another. The form of transition however, as has been shown here by Comrade <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, depends on concrete historical circumstances. Moreover, the question of whether the methods are more peaceful or more violent depends not so much on the working class as on the degree of resistance offered by the exploiting classes in the process of being overthrown, unwilling voluntarily to part with big property, political power, and other privileges in their hands.”

<p>In other words, if sheep resist being eaten by wolves this constitutes aggression by sheep. It may be useful to make this point in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussion November 17.</p>

<p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> in general terms of last night’s incident of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> detention three U.S. soldiers and trucks and stated we felt <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s had been forced to back down on this issue.<note n="1" xml:id="d38fn1">At 1 p.m. Berlin time on November 14, three covered U.S. Army vehicles were detained at the Babelsberg checkpoint for refusing to allow inspection by Soviet officials.

<p>Mayor then read excerpts from yesterday’s <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statement.<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">See <ref target="#d37fn1">footnote 1, Document 37</ref>.</note> Mayor felt these remarks constituted backdown by <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> brought up subject possible East German takeover <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> surface checkpoints. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> stated we had no information such move impending. In reply to <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> question as to what we would do in event such takeover, Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> stated one could see three alternative courses: 1) complete refusal accept East Germans at checkpoints and use of force to maintain surface access; 2) refusal transit East German checkpoints which would result in “self-imposed blockade”; 3) accept under protest controls by East Germans making clear we do so only because they agents of <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s in whom ultimate authority continues to reside. Mayor felt first course most dangerous of the three (Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> agreed) and would probably at least lead to blockade of traffic between <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and Berlin and strangulation of city. Although “self-imposed blockade” feasible because, as Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> observed, garrisons could be supplied by air, Mayor felt this step offered at best prospect <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> demand for vastly increased documentation and control measures to obtain surface access for garrisons. Although recognizing that acceptance East Germans as agents definite step in wrong direction, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> felt on balance this was best of the three courses of action.</p>
<p>Gravest danger present situation, according <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>, is throttling of Berlin economy and Mayor stated he had confidential information from high East German source who preparing to defect that this was real Communist target. In reply to query by Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> stated that some Berlin industrialists already worried, that Senate had been watching economic indices but had noted only moderate private stockpiling staple commodities, some movement family valuables and documents to <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>, and no significant bank withdrawals. Thus, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> felt local economic reaction not alarming.</p>
<p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> noted that there had been considerable speculation concerning further statements that might be made by U.S., British and French to reaffirm joint Berlin security guarantee. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> said he felt enough statements already made and that reiteration might weaken value of guarantee by casting doubt on previous assertions. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> stated that in his opinion enough has been said concerning Berlin guarantee and he thoroughly agreed further affirmation inadvisable at this time.</p>
<p>Throughout visit it apparent that <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> greatly pleased by Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>’s call and evidence solidarity it represented.</p>

From <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trimble</persName>. It view <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> with which Gen <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BFJ1">Burns</persName>, and I agree that procedure Soviets intend to follow in transferring controls to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will be gradual. They will seek avoid any steps which in itself might be regarded as Rubicon and thus provide basis to rally West public opinion in support vigorous counter-measures. Rather Soviets apparently hope by slow but steady turning of screw to bring about situation in which position West powers Berlin will eventually become untenable. They will presumably follow probing tactics and when they meet firm resistance at one point will recoil and then press at another.</p>
<p>Soviet will also, in opinion <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BFJ1">Burns</persName>, myself, use East Germans as cloak rather than employ their own forces. Indication this found last night’s incident when platoon <gloss target="#t_Vopo1">Vopo</gloss>’s surrounded vehicles while only usual small Soviet detachment at checkpoint.<note n="1" xml:id="d39fn1">See <ref target="#d38fn1">footnote 1, Document 38</ref>.</note></p>
<p>In our view stoppage convoy was carefully planned in advance and constituted most serious probe our intentions in recent times. Reply our telephonic protest made with unusual speed and unusual activity noted Karlshorst for so late in evening. Also this first time Soviet refused permit trucks return unless inspected. Although they modified position, fact remains that trucks did not get through to <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and incident provided Soviet opportunity to state categorically that they would hereafter exercise their “right inspect convoys.”</p>
<p>Consider it likely next move will be directed to air or rail access, probably latter. Re former consider essential commercial traffic be continued without interruption. <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> inspired rumor now circulating among Berliners that next move will be aimed commercial carriers. Their morale would suffer severely if service is suspended even temporarily. Therefore suggest arrangements be made with operators for requisitioning aircraft in such contingency and planes flown by Air Force crews, or similar measures which would ensure continuation service.</p>
<p>Realize that to turn trains back rather than accept <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control under protest would mean self-imposed blockade. Therefore do not <pb xml:id="pg_72" n="72" facs="0097"/>suggest we seek to alter present tripartite agreement. It will however be difficult to convince Berliners that we regard <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as exercising controls solely as agents Soviets.</p>
<p>In addition attempts interfere Allied access Berlin we consider it quite possible Soviet will take measures to weaken Berlin economy. They will as we see it, seek through propaganda methods to inspire flight of capital and a transfer of plants from Berlin to <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. Also they will presumably endeavor reduce flow industrial raw materials to Berlin. For example, tax on trucks or barges could be further increased, surface traffic impeded by “repairs” to roads, canals, etc. Resultant stagnation Berlin economy and unemployment would gravely affect morale here. In 1948 Berliners poor and had relatively little to lose. Today they reasonably prosperous.</p>
<p>While Soviet has power cripple Berlin’s economy, that of Soviet Zone also vulnerable to retaliation. Therefore suggest that if and when Soviet initiate measures along above lines, <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> in turn introduce prompt counter-measures re exports to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Realize this two-edged sword and <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> has been most reluctant employ this weapon in past. Nevertheless in our opinion it type of move which Communists would respect and occasion modification their tactics.</p>

When tested, if detention occurs, we should be prepared to recover our men and equipment by force.” (Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/11–1658)</note></p>
<p>My analysis of incident Nov 14 and our actions for future follow:</p>
<p>We have reported in reference (4) that incident of Nov 14 constituted most serious probe in recent times of our intentions and test of our willingness to stand firm. That <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s chose Nov 14th for this test could conceivably have been done to determine our likely future reaction in event <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s do try to implement threats contained <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech Nov 10. However I do not see incident Nov 14 as either beginning of a blockade or actual implementation by <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s Nov 10 threats, especially in light his Nov 14 speech and local manifestations “dampening down” (<gloss target="#t_USBER1">USBER</gloss> <gloss target="#t_tel1">tel</gloss> 285 to Bonn, 332 to Dept).<note n="6" xml:id="d40fn6">Telegram 332, November 14, summarized press and official East German statements that indicated efforts to “dampen down” reaction following <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221/11–1458)</note></p>
<p>Type of action more likely to signal beginning of implementation <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s threats could be abolition <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Kommandatura Berlin or turn-over one or more access controls to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>Inspection issue has been with us in increasingly acute form since early this summer but our access not significantly impaired as result <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> inspection demand and our non-compliance. Most U.S. supplies transported by trains and most supplies traveling on autobahn sent in open or partially covered vehicles which experience little trouble in transiting SovZone. Since interior these vehicles at least partially visible, <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s have apparently satisfied themselves re their inspection criteria.</p>
<p>Incident which occurred Nov 14 was unexpected, since we did not think <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s would go so far as to hold three American soldiers and three trucks at Nowawes (Babelsberg) checkpoint. Finding ourselves in situation we did, Gen <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> was prepared use armed force to extricate his <pb xml:id="pg_74" n="74" facs="0099"/>men and vehicles. In this proposed action <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trimble</persName>, who was in Berlin, and I concurred.</p>
<p>Since <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s finally released vehicles night of Nov 14 without inspection despite previous assertions that evening, it almost certain <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s will demand to exercise right of inspection with next U.S. covered vehicle we dispatch. (Acting <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">Pol Ad</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_SMAS1">Shilov</persName> was very specific to me night of 14 Nov on point that in future <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s will “continue to exercise right of inspection.”) I would expect <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s to hold next covered vehicle(s) and U.S. soldier driver(s) at Nowawes as they did on 14 Nov. This time <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s might feel they could not afford back down in response to even strongest protest and in end we might have to go in and get men and vehicles out with U.S. armed forces. Should this be necessary and even if we got away with it without firing a shot, such action would certainly contribute to a serious heightening of tensions here and might provoke reprisals such as possible action against Steinstuecken.</p>
<p>There are other courses <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s might follow with next covered vehicles dispatched from Berlin, such as letting them through checkpoint Nowawes and detaining them at Helmstedt—or even midway along autobahn.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon <gloss target="#t_AFN1">AFN</gloss> Berlin broadcast that U.S. military authorities planning send convoy down autobahn “to test Russian intentions.” Today, <gloss target="#t_AFN1">AFN</gloss> Berlin carried newscast stating: “President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and American Ambassador to West Germany are to meet Monday discuss Berlin situation. Meeting follows army decision send another convoy down Berlin autobahn.” (We informed material for both newscasts came from Frankfurt.)</p>
<p>If such action is taken with convoy which contains one or more covered vehicles (as proposed references 5 and 6 for Tuesday or soonest thereafter) and should it result in armed incident or even publicity resulting from probable detention U.S. soldiers, it would be difficult to explain to our public and that of our Allies why we make such an issue over a “peep under the canvas.” (There are of course sound reasons for absolutely refusing to let <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s inspect our vehicles. Dept is aware of reasons and I concur wholeheartedly with them.)</p>
<p>I do not feel that now is the time in Berlin for us to probe <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> intentions in this manner unless there are overriding considerations for doing so not apparent here. Our correct posture in Berlin at this time, it seems to me, is to remain steadfast, react firmly to any Communist effort to push us around, but not knowingly go out and seek trouble. After events of the night of Nov 14 our local position vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s in Berlin is strong enough not to require that for present we take offensive unnecessarily.</p>

I moreover fully endorse Berlin’s view that at least for time being there more to be gained by remaining steadfast and reacting firmly to any Soviet or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> pressures as they may develop than by seeking to probe their intentions by actions such as that proposed <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss>’s <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> 9–6071.<note n="4" xml:id="d41fn4">See <ref target="#d40fn5">footnote 5, Document 40</ref>.</note></p>

</list>
<p>At his request and under instructions from his Government, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> called on the Secretary today to discuss the Berlin situation. He began by saying that the Chancellor and the Foreign Minister had authorized him to express the gratitude of the Federal Republic for the prompt and very clear position taken by the American Government after the first <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statement in Moscow on November 10. He noted that the Federal Government did not believe this to be an improvised step, but one prepared for a long time. There had been articles and statements for nearly a year in the East German press and various <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> scientific publications presaging the language and argumentation which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> used. The Federal Government believes, therefore, that the situation has to be taken seriously, and that inevitable concrete developments will follow the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statement. The Federal Government had noted that, if the Soviets denounced the Potsdam Agreement (which it was realized was not the basis of the Allies’ right to be in Berlin) this would also have some effect on the German unification problem. For example, there is reference in the Potsdam Agreement to a peace settlement with one German Government.</p>
<p>The Federal Government recognized that there was a dangerous possibility that the Pankow representatives would have to be dealt with on routine matters if there were no Soviet authorities available. As the Secretary was aware, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> continued, the Federal Republic has current technical contacts with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. These might have to be intensified in a dangerous way. The Federal Government feels that the Three Powers may be forced to deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> representatives at the check points if there are no other means to maintain the flow of traffic. It foresaw special dangers in the field of air access. His Government was not certain what the consequences would be if the Soviets withdrew <pb xml:id="pg_77" n="77" facs="0102"/>from the Berlin Air Safety Center, but it seemed likely that civil traffic would end if there were to be any real difficulties. This would, of course, affect the flow of tourists and private passengers who would be afraid to travel to Berlin. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> requested American views regarding possible counter-measures, adding that he had already been told during the recent conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d42fn1">See <ref target="#d29">Document 29</ref>.</note> that there were tripartite plans in existence for handling different possible situations. As to a tripartite or <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> statement on Berlin, the German Government did not feel that this was an urgent requirement, at least for the next few days, but believed that one should be prepared for possible emergency use.</p>
<p>The Secretary noted that there were two aspects to the problem: the effort by the Soviet Union to turn over its responsibilities to the East Germans, and harassment by the Soviets of our transit movements, for example, as in the recent incident involving military truck traffic. The Secretary said that he assumed the Ambassador’s queries related more to the first rather than to the second type of problem. However, our people in Europe, especially the military, took a serious view of the recent incident on the Autobahn. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> commented that he had no information regarding this incident from the Foreign Office, and he did not have the impression that it had been taken very seriously there.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that we are having some discussions with the British and French as to the position to be taken relative to Soviet efforts to pass their responsibilities on to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to compel recognition of the latter. He added that we would, of course, be very anxious to learn what the Federal Government thinks our position ought to be, since this is obviously a matter of great concern to it. Sometimes the United States has the impression that we are inclined to react more strongly to such situations than the British, French, or the Germans. Last May, the Secretary continued, when he was in Berlin<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">See <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> and the question of tariffs and canal tolls was being discussed, he noted a certain complacency on the part of the Federal Republic and an unwillingness to take counter-measures of any kind. He did not necessarily question the decisions finally taken, but could not help but note the fact that there was this reluctance to take counter-measures which would disturb economic relations between the Federal Republic and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. However, the Secretary had noted the Chancellor’s statement of last week<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">Not further identified.</note> indicating that he might be considering the possibility of counter-measures in the present situation.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_78" n="78" facs="0103"/>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said that, in his own experience, which involved participation in governmental groups studying the possibility of counter-measures, it was difficult to find such measures which would really have a permanent effect on the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Secretary’s impressions regarding the waterways issue were correct, but he believed the present attitude of the Federal Republic to be more decisive and to involve stronger feelings about the threat to Berlin.</p>
<p>The Secretary stated that, as far as having certain practical dealings with people purporting to be <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials were concerned, he personally did not feel too strongly one way or the other. One could treat them as agents of the Soviet Union or just deal with them. After all, we deal with the Chinese Communists when necessary in certain practical situations. We do not recognize them politically, but do recognize them as a force to be dealt with, as for example, at the time of the Korean Armistice negotiations, the negotiations over Indo-China in Geneva, and in our efforts to get civilian prisoners released. The Secretary referred to the kidnapper analogy used at the time of the helicopter case.<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">Reference is to the crash of a U.S. helicopter in East Germany on June 7.</note> He said that when someone kidnapped your child, you deal with the kidnappers to get the child released. Such dealings need not have any political implications. The Secretary added that his remarks should not be interpreted as representing any definitive view, since we had not yet had any complete exchange with the British and French on the subject. If the Federal Republic has strong views on the matter they would of course have to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said he had noted the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> report of yesterday indicating that, under certain limited circumstances, the United States might be prepared to deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials holding them as agents for the Soviets. Apparently Bonn was not too happy about that. The feeling there was that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would soon begin to formulate their documents so as to make it impossible to regard their checkpoint officials merely as Soviet agents. As to the idea of direct negotiations similar to those in the Red Chinese case, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> personally felt this was a possible course of action, but he recognized that in Bonn it would create great psychological difficulties. For many years people had been taught that, if you deal with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> it means recognition; now they would have to be told that it does not really mean this.</p>
<p>The Secretary said we have a theory, as in the Red Chinese case, that you can have dealings with these people without implying recognition. The situation was obviously one where the considered views of the Federal Republic should be carefully weighed in the scales.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_79" n="79" facs="0104"/>
<p>The Secretary went on to say that we must think through the entire problem to see if we are prepared to accept the consequences. We apparently are prepared to accept more serious consequences than the British or French. The Secretary, himself, believed in the principle that where the Soviets probed to find weaknesses, there we should show strength. This policy had been fairly successful, for example, in the Far and Middle East. He had always assumed that Berlin was a logical place for a probe by the Soviets. The problem is what can be done in specific cases. The United States is not alone here. The British, French, and also the Federal Republic are involved, and we will not come to any final decisions without ascertaining the views of the Federal Republic as to contemplated courses of action. The Secretary added that he, himself, doubted the practicability of total non-recognition of the existence of something which is a fact. He felt that, if something is a fact, we have to recognize this fact even if we don’t like it. In time of war we recognize the existence of the enemy as a fact. To pretend the enemy does not exist is not a very realistic or practical policy. However, the United States will be found to be prepared to be as tough as anyone else in this situation, but not alone.</p>
<p>The Secretary continued that we are also concerned with interference to our trucks and whether to make a major issue of it or not. We will need to take account of French, British, and Federal Republic views in this matter. We should perhaps give more weight than in the past to the views of the Federal Republic, and the Federal Republic should perhaps assume more responsibility in these matters.</p>
<p>The Secretary said we had no clear view as to whether the subject should be discussed in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It would be in line with our policy of encouraging political consultation to do so. If Quemoy and Matsu were proper subjects for discussion in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, then the Berlin situation certainly seemed to be also. One could not say that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is not interested in this problem. There must probably be some discussion in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but the final responsibility for decisions must rest with the Three Powers that had juridical responsibility. This responsibility could be shared perhaps with the Federal Republic.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said he felt that Berlin should be mentioned in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué to be issued at the December Ministerial Meeting. It was mentioned last year, and also in the 1954 communiqué on the Paris Agreements.<note n="5" xml:id="d42fn5">For texts of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué, December 19, 1957, and the Paris communiqué, October 23, 1954, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> January 6, 1958, pp. 12–15 and November 15, 1954, p. 732.</note> He would like to suggest that the existing Quadripartite Committee in Bonn deal with the question of counter-measures <pb xml:id="pg_80" n="80" facs="0105"/>and the related problems. He felt that this was an adequate, body for such consultation.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> indicated he had one further short question to ask. He said his Government had, of course, followed with close attention the recent statement of Defense Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> and the subsequent statement issued by the State Department.<note n="6" xml:id="d42fn6">For texts of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>’s statement on U.S. global military strategy including a reduction in U.S. military manpower, November 13, and the Department of State statement on it, November 14, see <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Statements,</hi> vol. IV, pp. 1742–1761.</note> He noted there might be some fear that American forces would be weakened in the Federal Republic under the <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> scheme. The Secretary said he did not think there would be any substantial repercussions. We are, of course, constantly re-examining our forces here and in Asia to meet changed requirements, but no change in policy so far as Europe was concerned was intended.</p>

<p>Meeting being reported in full.<note n="1" xml:id="d43fn1"><gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 1333 from Paris, November 17. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> Following are highlights:</p>
<p>1. There was strong pressure from all members and chairman for fullest use of consultative process in North Atlantic Council on all matters connected with Berlin situation and broader context of other related Soviet moves connected with Central European area, e.g., New Rapacki Plan.<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">The Rapacki Plan, first proposed by Polish Foreign Minister Adam Rapacki in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly on October 2, 1957, and subsequently renewed through diplomatic channels, called for the establishment of a denuclearized zone in Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and the Federal Republic of Germany. See vol. X, Part 1, <ref target="#d12">Document 12</ref>.</note> [3 <hi rend="italic">lines of source text not declassified</hi>] While special role of three <pb xml:id="pg_81" n="81" facs="0106"/>Western powers recognized, strongly expressed consensus was that this was no substitute for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultation. <persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Stikker</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d43fn3"><persName corresp="#p_SDU1">Dirk U.

<p>2. Sense of meeting was that West should stand firm against Soviet moves but should use utmost wisdom and soundest deliberation to avoid provocation of incidents which Soviet seems to be seeking to have West “initiate.” In our judgment this discussion bears on handling of Babelsberg incident which was simply reported factually.</p>

<p>1012. Paris for Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>. British Embassy has given Department memorandum<note n="1" xml:id="d45fn1">A copy of the full text of the British memorandum was transmitted to Bonn in instruction <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>–4536, November 20. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.00/11–2058)</note> setting forth Foreign Office views on current Berlin situation and has asked whether Department agrees with analysis. Following is substance of memorandum.</p>
<p>We should proceed on assumption Soviets will sooner or later “hand over to sovereign <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> those functions in Berlin which are still maintained by Soviet organs” as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> threatened in November 10 speech.</p>
<p>Among Soviet motives are (1) desire create atmosphere of crisis which could produce climate of opinion in West favorable to high-level discussions of future of Germany, in which Soviets would support revised Rapacki Plan as measure to deny nuclear capability to Bundeswehr (<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> considers that Americans are on point of supplying West German forces with nuclear weapons and it may not be too late to prevent this) and (2) desire force Western Powers ultimately to recognize <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, in order to consolidate satellite empire and imprison Poland within status quo.</p>
<p>We cannot prevent <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> from carrying out his threat; main question is decide how react when he does it.</p>
<p>We must proceed from assumption we would resort to force, with all risks that entails, rather than submit to Berlin’s being starved out. But immediate issue is whether submit to dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> representatives on practical matters relating to transport and communications on same basis we have hitherto dealt with Soviets.</p>
<p>It is clearly in our interest agree in practice we should deal with representatives of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> rather than refuse do so and thus precipitate new blockade of Berlin which in last resort might have to be broken by force. It would therefore seem worthwhile work out set of rules for our authorities which would enable them when time came to deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authorities without implying this action constituted recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Government and while maintaining theory Soviets remain responsible.</p>
<p>But such modus vivendi would not be allowed operate for very long, if at all. We would soon find ourselves faced with further choice of <pb xml:id="pg_83" n="83" facs="0108"/>recognizing <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or exposing Berlin to blockade which would in last resort have to be broken by force. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, who has been for long time in position oblige us make this choice, has probably calculated we would prefer recognize <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. “So far as UK concerned, he would be right.” Nobody in West would believe avoiding recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is worth a war.</p>
<p>In short, we may have to choose between:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) abandoning Berlin;</item>
<item>(b) resorting to force;</item>
<item>(c) staying in Berlin but dealing with and, if necessary, ultimately recognizing <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</item>
</list>
<p>“Course (a) is out of the question and course (c) is greatly to be preferred to course (b).”</p>
<p>Our decision re dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> must depend partly on our ability stage a successful airlift and continue it indefinitely, which Foreign Office believes may be impossible. Airlift difficulties are such that it is unlikely blockade could be resisted for longer than about fifteen months. Would seem prudent accept this estimate for political planning purposes.</p>
<p>Foreign Office is instructing British Embassy Bonn (1) push on with negotiations with Federal Republic regarding facilities which would be required from latter in event of airlift (financial aspect of airlift and appropriate Federal Republic contribution will also require consideration and (2) concert with US and French Embassies estimates of requirements of “miniature airlift” which would take care of Allied official and military traffic only.</p>

<p>British Embassy Paris has handed same memorandum to French Foreign Office.</p>

<p>18. The Secretary welcomed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWR1">Burgess</persName> to the meeting.</p>
<p>The Ambassador reported that yesterday’s meeting of the North Atlantic Council had indicated keen interest in the Berlin situation and a desire by all members for full consultation.<note n="1" xml:id="d46fn1">See <ref target="#d43">Document 43</ref>.</note> The Germans had been given a pretty good working-over on their draft reply to the Soviet note of September 18.<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">For texts of these two notes, see <hi rend="italic">Moskau Bonn,</hi> pp. 432–434 and 459.</note></p>

I said that the rather extreme views advocated yesterday and the day before by General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had been moderated by better understanding with the British, the French and the Germans before we took a position that might lead to shooting.</p>

<p>The President reviewed at some length his recollection of the history of the Berlin arrangements; his feeling that we perhaps should not have committed ourselves as deeply as we had to Berlin, where he said the situation was basically untenable, as in the case of Quemoy and Matsu. However, he recognized that we were where we were and had to stand firm. The President emphasized, however, that we needed to have understanding with the British, the French and the Germans on this matter.</p>

<p>2752. Reference: <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2737.<note n="1" xml:id="d49fn1">See <ref target="#d45fn2">footnote 2, Document 45</ref>.</note> As were leaving a small dinner at <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s Inn last night I mentioned quite casually to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> that I wondered whether we were not getting off our joint track re Berlin. It was immediately apparent that I had struck a nerve and he asked me if I would upon leaving the party come with him to his house. There we discussed UK memo<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2">See <ref target="#d45">Document 45</ref>.</note> which I told him we had seen and which had bothered me considerably since it seemed to imply that the preferred British position involved the recognition of the East German Government. He had not seen, he said, the whole message when it was sent and it did not have his specific approval. However, it was quite apparent that it had a lot of his thinking in it. At the end of our discussion during which it was clear to me that he was fearful that his office had loosed off a premature rocket he asked that I not report our talk immediately but that we meet again “with as many people as you want to bring” at noon the following morning. After meeting with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> at Foreign Office this morning, I believe we have obtained some clarification of British views and may eliminate certain misunderstandings occasioned by original <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> memorandum.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that memorandum should certainly not be regarded as more than stimulus for discussion, since he had checked with none of his colleagues in government. He said that he was anxious we should remain on “same wavelength” re Berlin problem, but apparently we had received impression that British Government way out ahead re question recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Reading text of Bonn’s 1065 to Department,<note n="1" target="d49fn1">See <ref target="#d45fn2">footnote 2, Document 45</ref>.</note> he said that he could agree with everything stated in paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. Paragraph 5 based on misunderstanding of British point, and real point of difference between us that discussed in paragraph 3.<note n="3" xml:id="d49fn3">Paragraph 5 of telegram 1065 discussed how much the Western powers could deal directly with the East Germans without recognizing them.</note> <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that no disagreement about our being on “slippery slope” when we begin to make de facto arrangements with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, but in British view bottom of slope would be reached by recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and they saw no reason why this should lead to our ejection from Berlin. We suggested <pb xml:id="pg_87" n="87" facs="0112"/>that slope might not end there, and it would in any event involve major revision of our policy against partition of Germany. We doubted that it would be acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that everything of course depended upon acceptability to Federal Republic. British first choice was that there be no change in existing arrangement, and if Soviets or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interfered with access to Berlin we should respond vigorously in first place. He did not agree with his staff on ineffectiveness of air lift, feeling that if it could be maintained twelve months, that was as good as indefinitely. However, air lift would be a nuisance and would involve large expenses which Germans could afford much better than British. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> felt that it would be absurd of West Germans to refuse to deal with East Germans, if we made it clear that we intended to stay in Berlin. Main point of British suggestion, which had possibly been misunderstood, was that if West Germans were to decide to make arrangements with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> rather than bear cost of provisioning Berlin, and such arrangements led or amounted to West German recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, certainly British for their part would have no objection, no need to be more royal than the King. It all depended on what West Germans willing to do.</p>
<p>We suggested that our presence in Berlin and position vis-à-vis Soviets involved more than merely German considerations (i.e. what West Germans willing to accept). It seemed to us of significance for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and whole East-West position over and beyond West Germans and Berliners.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> summed up by saying that there was not much difference between us. It was clear we could not go against wishes of Federal Republic, provided they realized that we might have to submit to some de facto arrangements. This would create danger of slide toward recognition, and there was something in point that it might confirm partition of Germany, which <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> would be against. However, we were not quite in agreement that recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would lead to further slide toward our physical removal from Berlin. Agreed that at latter point issue of force would be raised. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> was worried lest British memorandum gave impression that UK “almost welcomed” recognition, and hoped that Germans would not receive wrong impression. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> de Murviile had agreed with him that merely implied recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was better than risk of war. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> felt that purpose of memorandum would be served if it led to further study of problem, before Berlin situation became acute.</p>
<p>I informed him that no instructions had been received from Department, but I had wished to obtain his considered views for Department’s information.</p>
<p>As our meeting broke up, I asked <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> what he thought <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s attitude would be about recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> if this became <pb xml:id="pg_88" n="88" facs="0113"/>issue. He replied that question will not arise in such clear cut way, but there will be a de facto process which would lead step by step towards recognition.<note n="4" xml:id="d49fn4">In telegram 2753 from London, November 17 at 5 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_WJH1">Whitney</persName> reported a further discussion of the memorandum between an Embassy officer and a Foreign Office official during which the latter indicated that the British could never go to war over the question of recognition of the German Democratic Republic. The official stressed further that the British were uncertain of the strength of the Federal Republic on the issue and would not incur risks over Berlin if the West Germans were reluctant to make sacrifices on the question.

<p>We consider British unrealistic in assumption contained “course C” their memo that recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would permit continued Allied occupation Berlin. Once recognition accorded <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, four-power status officially ended and continued Allied occupation city stripped of legal basis.</p>
<p>While compromises possible which could prolong Allied “occupation” in one form or another, stated objective of Communists is to get Allies out and continued pressures, harassments and threats would, we believe, force us ultimately either abandon city or resort to force. Meanwhile, with “writing on wall,” there little expectation city could survive economically with industry depending on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> acquiescence for imports-exports and Allied position on wane.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_89" n="89" facs="0114"/>
<p>British suggestion of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> recognition appears ignore fact that all of Berlin is claimed as capital <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It also overlooks effect such recognition on East German population and on stability <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> which could embark on harder Stalinist program internally and appreciably step up pressure on <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. UK proposal appears ignore fact that Berlin policy is but one segment of our German policy. Ramifications of our recognizing <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be manifold. One clear result would be to discredit our firmest German friends who support Western European integration policy and encourage disenchantment US leadership, with probable consequent boosting of stock of German neutralists. British, it seems to us, have failed to recognize that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s deal with Berlin as part of world power balance.</p>
<p>For foregoing reasons, mission has viewed askance any steps in direction acceptance <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control of access routes even allowing <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> “agents” place date stamp on surface travel orders as tripartite policy now envisages should <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> take over controls (Berlin <gloss target="#t_tel1">tel</gloss> 298 to Bonn, rptd Dept 345).<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">Telegram 298, November 16, reported that at a meeting on November 14 the three Western Political Advisers had reached agreement on tripartite positions on air access to Berlin and procedures to be followed if the Soviet Union transferred its remaining occupation responsibilities to the East Germans. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/11–1658)</note> In mission view, basic decision needed on whether:</p>
<list>
<item>1. Allies play for time allowing <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to nibble away until Allied position untenable, thus postponing day of decision re use force or abandoning city. Berlin’s economic position likely suffer severely meanwhile.</item>
<item>2. We take forthright stand now by refusing accept <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> controls in any form and making clear our determination remain Berlin.</item>
</list>
<p>On basic assumption of British that we cannot prevent <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> from carrying out threat, we leave it to the appropriate world capitals to determine whether this assumption is correct. We hope it is not. We believe that trap Soviets are laying for us could result in such serious consequences that every effort should be made to stop them.</p>
<p>We venture one suggestion:</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statements on Berlin beginning Nov 10 have implied willingness negotiate question and at least some Soviet and <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Bloc interpretations of that speech seem to have placed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> declaration within framework all-German settlement. Important factor now would seem to be to insure that possible four-power negotiations not begin under Soviet preconditions. Allies might therefore consider proposing immediate four-power conference with sufficiently vague and limited preconditions to permit Soviet acceptance without loss of face. Idea would be to take advantage of what may be short-lived opportunity <pb xml:id="pg_90" n="90" facs="0115"/>deal with Soviets on equal basis before we find ourselves faced with a <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> fait accompli.</p>
<p>In short, choice appears be resist now, using opportunity seize initiative with Soviets, or face having to resist Soviets together with stabilized and strengthened <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in a weakened Berlin later.</p>

Spring of trap is turnover to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> of control Allied access to Berlin.</p>
<p>On surface access Allies will, if trap sprung, be faced with three choices: (1) refuse to accept <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control and employ force; (2) accept <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control; (3) impose self-blockade.</p>
<p>First course of action might involve a considerable military operation and mission not in position to judge its feasibility. Even if first convoy gets through, it probable succeeding convoys will be faced with destroyed bridges, road blocks, mines, etc, thus rendering operation impossible short of stationing troops along entire length of autobahn and/or railroad (slightly over 100 miles each).</p>
<p>If second course of action adopted Allies will, mission believes, be faced with a series of crises, each more serious than the last, and at each step of the way the Communists will be in ever more advantageous position to apply pressure. Possible pattern of this series of crises given <gloss target="#t_ourtel1">ourtel</gloss> 273 to Bonn, 320 to Dept.<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2"><ref target="#d27">Document 27</ref>.</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_91" n="91" facs="0116"/>
<p>It is possible, of course, to draw the line at technical contact with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. However, mission sees following difficulties:</p>
<list>
<item>(A) Even technical contact with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would tarnish our prestige with West Berliners and West Germans and would lessen their resolve to stand firm;</item>
<item>(B) Mission judges, in light of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 236 to Berlin, 1012 to Bonn,<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3"><ref target="#d45">Document 45</ref>.</note> that it would be very difficult to persuade British to draw a line once they go so far as to have technical contacts;</item>
<item>(C) If we should be successful in persuading British to draw the line at technical contacts, mission believes it unlikely <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be willing to accept such a line. Communists would surely put heavy pressure on Allies to yield on the line, and allied refusal would leave us with choice of courses of action (1) and (3).</item>
</list>
<p>If we do not adopt course of action (1), then we will have to adopt course of action (3). Under these circumstances, therefore, mission believes strongly that wisest course would be to adopt course of action (3) at the outset, and do so firmly and with forthrightness.</p>
<p>If decision in connection with course of action (1) that ultimately we would choose self-imposed blockade, then to impose this blockade on ourselves from the very beginning offers two distinct advantages:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) We do not compromise ourselves in German eyes, East or West, as would be the case were we to have technical contacts with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and then later have to impose self-blockade.</item>
<item>(2) If there is any chance of shaking Communist resolve by local action once control of surface access is turned over to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, best chance of success lies in Allies making unmistakably clear from the beginning that they cannot be blackmailed into recognizing <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> (for this reason we earnestly recommend tripartite adoption in Bonn of suggestion that Allied travellers not release travel documents to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>—<gloss target="#t_ourtel1">ourtel</gloss> 298 to Bonn, 345 to Dept).<note n="4" xml:id="d51fn4">See <ref target="#d50fn2">footnote 2, Document 50</ref>.</note></item>
</list>
<p>With Allied self-imposed blockade, Communists might not at first interfere with German surface transit between <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and Berlin. Self-imposed blockade might therefore at first require only small airlift to take care of Allied garrisons. Most supplies could be purchased locally in West Berlin. If we are vouchsafed such a “breather” we are afforded a last opportunity—through diplomatic channels and if need be by some more naked form of pressure at points where we have the advantage of position—to persuade the Communists to back down on Berlin.</p>
<p>If we should be unsuccessful at this point in forcing Communists to back down on Berlin we can assume that their next step would be total land blockade. This would require Allies to supply all West Berlin by airlift.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_92" n="92" facs="0117"/>
<p>In mission’s opinion, Communist interference with air corridors to be effective would require them to initiate action by force against our planes. Mission believes it most unlikely Communists would go this far in view of our security guarantee. If they do, mission feels we will just have to be prepared to counter force with force in air corridors.</p>
<p>Mission believes, therefore, that probable ultimate price we would have to pay locally to counter threatened <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> move against Berlin is fullscale airlift. Airlift will be expensive, and it may have to go on for months. Sooner Communists realize they may be [open?] to countermeasures which the West may have to take elsewhere in the world to force the Communists give up their designs against Berlin.</p>
<p>As far as local action is concerned, mission believes that anything short of Allied willingness to go the limit on airlift entails dangerous risk of ultimate degeneration Allied position in Berlin to point where it will be untenable.</p>
<p>Mission is aware of Herculean effort involved in selling this thesis to British, possibly to French, and to our own citizens. It will be difficult to explain why we may have to support an airlift, to say nothing of other countermeasures which may be necessary, because we are unwilling to accept visas from <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s too must know how difficult this is to explain. That is what they may be counting on.</p>

<p>2. I wish to state without equivocation that it is my firm opinion that our current plan with respect to acceptance of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials as agents of the Soviets will be the first step in the wrong direction and place us in a completely untenable position.</p>
<p>3. When the Soviets carry out <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s announced intentions and turn over their remaining occupation authority, the myth of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials acting as their agents will be too obvious to find support in any quarter. Reference 1B above, with which I concur completely, fully supports this position, and gives the reasons therefor.</p>
<p>4. We cannot show weakness in this issue. Berlin is in the eyes of the entire world. If we are not ready for the eventual show down, at least a self imposed blockade will be a far stronger action than de facto recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> through the “agent” fallacy.</p>
<p>5. I cannot recommend too strongly that we accept a self-imposed blockade rather than the “agent” plan.</p>

<p>Reading from prepared statement <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Smirnov</persName> said Soviet Government attaches importance to informing Federal Government that in very near future it will notify US, UK and France it going to abolish “occupation statute” for Berlin. (<persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Smirnov</persName> did not refer to four power agreements on Berlin, nor did he say that responsibilities incurred under such agreements would be transferred to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.) It belief <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> that all governments including <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> would welcome abolition occupation statute as contributing to relaxation of tension. <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Smirnov</persName> ignored <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>’s comment that there no “occupation statute” but rather four power agreement and continued that abolition of statute necessary as it no longer corresponds to present situation Berlin, has already been violated by Western powers and is not compatible with sovereignty <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> then stated emphatically that action proposed by Soviets would not contribute to relaxation of tension, but on contrary heighten it.

Re <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1080, November 20.<note n="1" xml:id="d54fn1"><ref target="#d53">Document 53</ref>.</note> After informing British Ambassador and French and U.S. Chargés of <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Smirnov</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> conversation this morning, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said he assumed Soviet Govt will shortly notify other governments its intention to abolish Berlin “occupation statute”, and follow this up by public declaration on subject. While there is of course no occupation statute Soviet will say so for propaganda purposes. Next Soviet will presumably assert that as four power control no longer in effect, <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will exercise authority hitherto held by Soviets, not as agent but in own right as sovereign state. Thesis will then be advanced that while part of “Germany” Berlin is situated in <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Therefore anything affecting Berlin must be discussed with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. For example, in two or three weeks Soviets may well state that as all traffic to and from Berlin passes through <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> territory, latter naturally has right control it.</p>
<p>In <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>’s view Soviets will proceed by slow and cautious steps, thus making it difficult to arouse West public opinion against any one of them. Unlike situation 1948 Soviets will not resort to “brutal” measures but rather seek by gradual moves to force West to negotiate with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> felt Berlin becoming a test of Western policy and first talk West powers have with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will be end of policy we have been following. He greatly concerned and personally regards situation as very dangerous. We have reached end of chapter, and we must never forget that attitude three West powers display toward Berlin constitutes yardstick by which their steadfastness measured generally. Unilateral action of Soviet in abolishing Four Power Agreement cannot be accepted. Any willingness on part of West to deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would mean surrender to Soviet and be interpreted as such in world opinion. (<persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> avoided specific reference to tripartite démarche (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1071, Nov. 19)<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">Telegram 1071 reported that on November 19 the three Western Embassies had informed the German Foreign Ministry about Western contingency plans for a Soviet transfer of responsibilities to East Germany, Among them was a tripartite protest to the Soviet Union.

I said that I had already seen summary of paper and with due deference my British colleague disagreed with various points in it and in particular with assumption on which it appeared based that every move Soviets might take would be successful and West powerless. For example, paper seems to ignore value economic countermeasures against <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and I urged <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> give serious consideration their use.</p>
<p>Steele said British memorandum merely put forth discussion purposes and agreed with me as did <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> and French Chargé economic retaliation by <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">Fed Rep</gloss> might well serve useful purpose.</p>
<p>As example strength German feeling Berlin issue, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said that Bundestag President <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName> at recent <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> faction meeting advocated break diplomatic relations in event <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> transfer authority to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>Fon Min stated he ordering home for consultation <gloss target="#t_GER1">Ger</gloss> Ambassadors Washington, London and Paris. He added that “if something should happen in Berlin”, he would propose immediate meeting three West Foreign Ministers and himself in London, Paris or Washington.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> concluded conversation by reiterating that any concession to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be very dangerous. Berlin will be a test case and any weakness “would eventually lead to catastrophe for West”.</p>

<p>1. Would appear that Soviets plan two steps 1) transfer their functions re Berlin to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and 2) a notification and perhaps justification to Western powers of their refusal continue recognize special status for Berlin.

<p>2.

[3 <hi rend="italic">lines of source text not declassified</hi>] British [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] must know that acceptance their position<note n="1" xml:id="d55fn1">See <ref target="#d45">Document 45</ref>.</note> including recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and latter’s control our access would have most serious effect on German and particularly Berlin population and govt and that minimum which would satisfy <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be effective control of Berlin escape route for refugees. I see no reason why Soviets, having disengaged from responsibility, should not allow airlift to go on indefinitely unless West German and Western counter blockade imposed sufficiently heavy burden on them to maintain East German economy. Evenso wonder if gradual strangulation West Berlin would not become unbearable first. In dealing with British memorandum suggest we start by trying to get agreed valuation on what Soviet objectives are and then try to get from them commitment as to how and under what circumstances they would agree to use of force to maintain our position in Berlin. Believe such examination will show that we will never have better opportunity of taking stand than we do at present time.</p>
<p>4. My recommendation is that we attempt to reach agreement with British and French that we will be prepared use force to, maintain road and air communications with Berlin and that we so inform Soviets and West Germans promptly but confidentially. (I assume it is impracticable to maintain rail communications by force.) If this position were adopted I believe it would be wise to show Soviets we mean business by taking at least some steps to move tanks and engineering units into position near East Zone frontier along autobahn routes. At same time believe we should indicate to Soviets our willingness negotiate on this problem.</p>
<p>5. Should Soviets act before agreement reached on foregoing policy believe we should show travel documents to East German officials but announce publicly that we do so on same basis as we accept normal traffic regulations so long as they are not abused but that we will use force rather than accept interference with our access to Berlin.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_98" n="98" facs="0123"/>
<p>6. If agreement cannot be reached on policy in foregoing para believe we should resort to self-imposed blockade but should at least keep some flexibility in our position by announcing that we reserve our right to use force to maintain our position.</p>

<p>1132. Eyes only Secretary. Am inclined believe Soviets will move soon on Berlin situation. Unless it is believed we could obtain British support for strong stand before Soviets take action suggest we might consider attempting secure prompt British and French agreement to bluff based on recommendation either para 4 or 5 <gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss> 1128.<note n="1" xml:id="d56fn1"><ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> We would agree secretly with British and French that if bluff called on either of these lines of action in lieu of actual use of force we would call for top level meeting with Soviets at which we would salvage what we could from the situation. Realize extremely dangerous to attempt bluff Soviets but I cannot see that we would have much more to lose than we will if present weak British position is accepted. To be successful decision would have to be extremely closely held by all governments concerned and dressed up with all appropriate moves including meeting of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> at which decision to use force would actually be taken.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">1. Berlin</hi></p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> opened the meeting with general remarks to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> were concerned that the U.S. would have to make a move very soon in connection with the Soviet intentions concerning Berlin. They did not want to be unprepared. With this in mind, they had prepared <hi rend="italic">draft instructions to <gloss target="#t_CINCUSAREUR1">CINCUSAREUR</gloss></hi><note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">Not further identified.</note> proposing the use of minimum force necessary to extricate any U.S. military truck convoy which might be detained by the Russians (General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> had discussed the proposed instructions with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> the previous day and had indicated that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> would not approve such instructions at this time).</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> discussed the political situation in general terms. He indicated that the Department had some concern about German attitudes, citing as an example the so-called trade agreement between East Germany and the Federal Republic. However, he believed that Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was firm in his views, as indicated in his reaction to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Smirnov</persName>’s pronouncement concerning the turning over of Soviet occupation rights to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">See <ref target="#d53">Document 53</ref>.</note> He said that it was perhaps too early to jump to conclusions on probable Soviet actions concerning Berlin but that the State Department view is that we should not give in on any substantial point. The question is one of means and tactics in countering or anticipating the Russian actions.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_100" n="100" facs="0125"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then referred to press items and other loose conversation regarding an airlift for Berlin, pointing out that evidence to date does not indicate that the USSR is thinking in terms of an immediate blockade of the civilian population of West Berlin. On the contrary, this would appear to be a more limited proposition designed to harass the Allied forces in Berlin with the ultimate intention of dislocating them from the city. There has been over-emphasis on the political reporting and press coverage on the question of the Russian intent to blockade the city. There does not appear to be a parallel with the 1948 blockade operation. However, the U.S. should remain flexible on the matter of an airlift which might conceivably be required by later developments, and no arbitrary decision should be taken now to exclude the possibility of an airlift.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> expressed concern that all the conjecture with reference to an airlift, which was receiving wide publicity, might lead the Russians into a miscalculation that we intended to start an airlift as a response to their new Berlin moves. He said an airlift should be a “last resort” measure. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> quoted previous statements of the President as stating that an airlift means war. He stated that the British were openly discussing airlift possibilities and that we should do everything possible to stop public consideration of this possibility. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed, but suggested that such speculation and public discussion were not easily stopped. He further pointed out in response to General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>’s remarks that it had been General <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName>’s and his position in 1948 that an airlift was a wrong solution for the Berlin situation; that we should then have stood for a solution on the ground as distinguished from the air.</p>
<p>With reference to the <hi rend="italic">detention of convoys,</hi> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated that the Department would like to explore at this meeting a <hi rend="italic">different approach</hi> than that proposed in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> instructions to <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss>. Instead of considering extricating a detained convoy with “minimum force necessary”, which appeared to be a negative approach, we would like to consider the possibility of providing a convoy with enough force to enable it to push through to its destination. There followed a general discussion in which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> pointed out that General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>’ proposal (endorsed by General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>) to extricate a convoy came about in consideration of the recent specific case in which for the first time the Soviets had held U.S. personnel and material at the check-point.<note n="4" xml:id="d57fn4">See <ref target="#d38fn1">footnote 1, Document 38</ref>.</note> The proposal had been considered in the context of past experience in Berlin; it involved the security of U.S. forces; it was not addressed to the willingness of the U.S. Government to consider a policy of utilizing force to <pb xml:id="pg_101" n="101" facs="0126"/>push through an inspection point. Such a course of action goes far beyond, and encompasses a larger problem; than the rescue of detained American personnel. He also posed the question of the substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel at the check-points in place of Russians, and the necessity for U.S. proposed courses of action to contemplate this contingency.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated that the Department felt that the proposal to extricate personnel was not an adequate answer to the basic problem. He proposed for consideration, in elaboration of his earlier remarks, that we inform the USSR in advance of our intention to take precautionary measures and to insure adequate security for our convoys. This would be done on the basis of our right of ingress which we intended to enforce. This warning would be given in advance of any use of force. He requested the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> estimate of the military risks involved in such a course of action.</p>
<p>General Lemnitzer discussed the factual situation and the <hi rend="italic">military risks</hi> involved in pushing across 100 miles of hostile territory. He pointed out that our Berlin forces consist of two small battle groups opposed to 25 top-notch Russian divisions. He stated that the military facts of life in that situation are hard. He pointed out the ease with which bridges could be blown up and road-blocks established. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated he was fully aware of these problems and risks as well as the Soviet military strength on the spot. Our military posture is, of course, unsatisfactory when viewed exclusively in those terms and we have faced this problem for a long time. There is much more involved, of course, in that the Russians are aware that an attack against our small force would bring into play a vastly different power situation. The question is whether we can or should take the risk involved in pushing through a convoy with force. General <persName corresp="#p_LGC1">LeMay</persName> expressed the view that the Soviets would back off. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated that he felt they would also have backed off in 1948 but the Joint Chiefs at that time thought the risk was too great. We are up against the same problem today and he felt that the current <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposals represented an inadequate reaction. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the “new approach” was in his opinion better and the Joint Chiefs would consider it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out at this time that we are initiating an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc working group</hi> to consider the Berlin situation and to recommend contingency measures and that we are already in touch with <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> and the Joint Staff to secure their representation on the group.<note n="5" xml:id="d57fn5">The Ad Hoc working group on Berlin, chaired by <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> and including Defense, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, and for the first meeting British and French representatives, held its first meeting at 3 p.m.on November 21 with the aim of coordinating and expediting actions with respect to the Berlin crisis. Memoranda for the record of its meetings on November 21, 22, and 24–26 are in the Washington National Records Center, RG 330, <gloss target="#t_OASDISA1">OASD/ISA</gloss> Files: FRC 62 A 1698, 092 Germany.</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_102" n="102" facs="0127"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> commented that he was personally in sympathy with this approach. From the overall viewpoint of the Department of Defense, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> would feel that the <hi rend="italic">position of strength</hi> we have gained through the Lebanon and Quemoy operations should not be dissipated by weakness over Berlin. He raised the question, assuming U.S. acceptance of such a firm policy, as to what degree of support we would secure from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (particularly the UK, France and Germany) and what pressures we would apply on them to secure their support. Would we be willing to act without them? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> concurred with the point of view on Lebanon and Quemoy. He felt that the Soviets have two objectives: (1) to secure from the Berlin situation a restoration of their prestige adversely affected as a result of Lebanon and the Taiwan Straits (he felt their prestige particularly had suffered in the Middle East) and (2) to move toward the accomplishment of their objectives in Germany. Berlin has been on the Soviet mind throughout the years and he had expected a serious Berlin crisis sooner than this. It may be that the Soviets have arrived at a decision to force the issue but we will have to find out as we go along and as their intentions and proposed courses of action become more clear. We had hoped that the working group could conduct a study of this problem as well as that stemming from their work we would be able to reach decisions which would, of course, have ultimately to be approved by the Secretary of State and the President. The next stop after agreement on the U.S. position would be discussions with the British, French and West Germans, as well as in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Perhaps the talks should be held both here and in Bonn. We are disturbed at the British attitude which, at first glance, appears to be soft, although Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> has spoken firmly.</p>
<p>General Lemniter returned to the question of the State Department views on <hi rend="italic">Russian intentions</hi> and asked why it was believed that the Russians did not intend to blockade the civilian population in Berlin. He asked what would happen if either the Russians or the East Germans began stopping train traffic and taking related measures to deny access to the city. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated that such action would appear to be inconsistent with the present Soviet line. Their hope is to obtain a closer relationship between East and West Germany on their terms. A blockade would nullify their efforts to secure this objective and would stiffen West German resistance. It should not be overlooked also that there is an appealing aspect to some Germans to an end to the occupation of Berlin and the withdrawal of all occupation forces. To get the Allies out of Berlin would be in the Russian thinking a first step towards reunification of Germany. This would have an effect on the sentiments of a segment of German public opinion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> commented that in his opinion it would appear unlikely that there would be an immediate blockade of the civilian traffic, since the “squeeze” is now on the occupation powers. <pb xml:id="pg_103" n="103" facs="0128"/>Such a blockade could come later if the Soviets calculated that it was necessary to put the “squeeze” on us through actions against the German population.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed that we could speak of Russian intentions only as a maneuver of the moment.</p>
<p>The agenda item concluded with a brief discussion of the <hi rend="italic">Berlin air safety center</hi> in which it was pointed out that our present plans envisage not accepting East Germans as a substitute for the Russian personnel now manning the center. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then agreed that consideration of the Berlin problem should now be taken up by the ad hoc working group and that a report from the group should be received and considered as soon as possible.</p>

<p>1096. Since Chancellor away Munich today <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName> and I saw <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> this afternoon,<note n="1" xml:id="d58fn1"><persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> returned to Bonn November 21 and, accompanied by <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tyler</persName>, called on <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> at 5:30 p.m.</note> and asked him for his views Berlin. He gave me account <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Smirnov</persName> talk with Chancellor which already reported (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1080).<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2"><ref target="#d53">Document 53</ref>.</note> He emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Smirnov</persName> had not referred to transfer power to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or to what measures would be taken with regard Berlin, but had said that “occupation statute” would be abolished.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> then expressed himself in vein utmost seriousness about possible future developments. He said present situation could not be compared with 1948 as this time there would be no open blockade. After Soviet Union had denounced Four Power Agreements Berlin and had declared <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereign, latter would proceed with great caution, <pb xml:id="pg_104" n="104" facs="0129"/>would take no steps at first, and would exercise controls in just same way Soviets, “possibly even more smoothly”. Perhaps 6 weeks later, <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would say that all Germans travelling to or from Berlin must obtain <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> approval. This would have effect [in] practice sealing off Berlin from <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and choking it economically and politically to point collapse.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> stressed his opinion if Western powers do not react to first step with utmost firmness and determination, avalanche will be let loose which nothing will be able stop, with catastrophic consequences for Europe and free world. “The West would then have lost the first bloodless blow of third world war”.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> stressed repeatedly “in full awareness responsibilities he was assuming” his conviction that firm stand now would cause Soviets back down. In this connection he had been horrified (“konsterniert”) by paper which British Ambassador had given him last night (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1080), in particular by the 3 alternatives of which last accepts de facto recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. [2 <hi rend="italic">lines of source text not declassified</hi>] At this point, I said that we had also received this paper which is being studied, that we had not passed on it, and that I personally had grave doubts that we would subscribe to it, although I had as yet received no instructions on the subject. I also said that we had not been consulted on its preparation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said he was leaving immediately after our talk for Berlin and would see <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName>, and Senat. He would be back Monday and would meet Tuesday with German Ambassadors from Paris, Washington, Rome, Moscow and London, who have been called to Bonn.</p>
<p>He said Chancellor had yesterday sent off letter to Secretary<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">See <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> expressing his concern, and would like see me soon. He said Chancellor is returning tomorrow night from Munich and I plan see him Sunday if possible.<note n="4" xml:id="d58fn4"><persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> called on <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday, November 22. The Chancellor stated that it would not be useful to speculate on the Berlin situation until the Soviet communication on it had been received, and <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> briefed him on the Western plans for proceeding in the event that the Soviets turned over their responsibilities to the East Germans. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> commented further that his discussion with <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Smirnov</persName> (see <ref target="#d53">Document 53</ref>) had been both unpleasant and unproductive. (Telegram 1103 from Bonn, November 22; Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/11–2258)</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said he thought that after Soviet Union had issued statement, which was probably imminent, might be good idea hold conference between three Western Governments and <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. Whatever course was taken, he added, should be taken in complete unity.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_105" n="105" facs="0130"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> had himself suggested that Berlin be on agenda <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> talk with Chancellor next Wednesday.<note n="5" xml:id="d58fn5">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> on November 26, see <ref target="#d75fn3">Document 75 and footnote 3</ref> thereto.</note></p>
<p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> what approach he personally thought might be taken on assumption Soviet statement would denounce four power status. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> stressed we should above all absolutely reject any such statement, on grounds no state has right withdraw from commitment and hand over its responsibilities to another party. Said would be as though <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> were to withdraw from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and name Austria as its substitute. He thought this approach might have some effect Soviet Union which had shown itself sensitive to charges breaking contractual obligations.</p>
<p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> his views with regard <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> checkpoint officials being considered agents of Soviets. He said this misleading because Soviets not handing over responsibilities to East German police but to Pankow. Said agent concept could only be sustained if East German officials acting on instructions from Soviet Union but this would not be in fact case, since they would be acting on instructions <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He said <persName corresp="#p_PMG1">Pervukhin</persName> would not accept protest this basis and would simply refer us to Pankow.</p>
<p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> how he thought German political and public opinion would react to firm Western measures which might be interpreted as possibly leading to war. He replied without hesitation that vast majority Germans consider Berlin test case, particularly after numerous repeated declarations which have led them expect strong reaction.</p>
<p>Referred to Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>’s recent statements and to <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName> mention possibility breaking off relations with Moscow as evidence undoubted solid German support for firm reaction.</p>

<p>His first task this afternoon was to deliver a personal message from Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2"><ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> He drew special attention to the last sentence in which <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said that it was desirable, even necessary, for the Four Governments (i.e. the United States, United Kingdom, French and German Governments) to meet when the Soviet Union announced its measures against Berlin. The time and place could be agreed through Ambassadors.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> asked what level of meeting the Chancellor had in mind. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> replied that he had no clear instructions on this point and thought that perhaps this had purposely been left “a little open” for discussion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> assured the Ambassador that the letter would be shown to the Acting Secretary at once. The Secretary was expected back in the Department on Monday afternoon.<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> vacationed on Duck Island in the St. Lawrence Seaway, November 18–24.</note></p>
<p>The Ambassador then said that he had instructions to stress the gravity of the situation which we faced. Although he did not wish to overdramatize, great firmness was required. The German Foreign Office feels that it would be dangerous to give in on the question of negotiations with Pankow. Although it does not feel that it would be decisive whether the West entered into certain types of technical contacts with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, technical contacts on questions which would involve our <pb xml:id="pg_107" n="107" facs="0132"/>quadripartite status and would have a bearing on our relations with the Soviet Union would seriously involve the prestige of the West in its dealings with the Soviet Union. Both the Chancellor and the Foreign Minister believe that if the West should enter precipitously into some sort of an arrangement which looked like giving in to Soviet pressure this could have a very demoralizing effect on many people in Germany and elsewhere. The morale of many Europeans would be impaired. The policy of non-recognition would be seriously jeopardized by dealing with the East Germans. This would encourage direct Pankow–Bonn talks and would be dangerous. The Chancellor and the Foreign Minister recommend a very decided and strong position in the whole situation.</p>
<p>The German Ambassador went on to discuss several other points. He referred to the news reports that a new Interzonal Trade Agreement had been concluded. He explained that a clause was included in the agreement providing for traffic between West Germany and Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> stressed that the agreement was a routine matter and that it merely represented at most a legalization of the status quo. No new arrangements were provided for. Technical contacts concerning interzonal trade had been in existence for many years and this interzonal trade agreement was a renegotiation of an agreement of long standing. If there was in fact a new clause on trade between Berlin and the West the Ambassador was sure that it had not been inserted in the last few days as a result of the Berlin crisis. Negotiations had been going on for a long time. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> stressed these points because he was afraid that U.S. newspapermen might distort the situation in reporting on this matter and attempt to connect it with the current crisis.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> then discussed at some length the thinking of the German Embassy on the Berlin situation. Their analysis ran along the following lines:</p>
<p>There were several courses of action theoretically open. The first of these was to reject any sort of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control over the access routes to Berlin whatsoever. In such a situation the Western Powers might react in one of a number of possible ways to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interference. If the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> insisted on controlling Allied trains and trucks, the trains or convoys could return to the crossing point and the Three Powers could rely on an airlift to supply their garrisons in Berlin. Alternatively they could attempt to push the trucks and trains through to Berlin by force. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> raised the question of what the train or convoy would do if the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> blew up the railroad or highway bridges.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> then raised the question of what would be done in case an airlift was mounted if the Soviets withdraw from the Berlin Air Safety Center. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that it was his understanding that the <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> was not the focal point for navigational guidance for allied planes but that it was limited to the filing of flight plans. Although the withdrawal <pb xml:id="pg_108" n="108" facs="0133"/>of the Soviet representative on <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss> might create problems as to rights of way in the corridors it would not affect the actual navigational controls normally in operation.</p>
<p>The German Ambassador then mentioned a third possible course of action. The Allies could call for negotiations with the USSR either in advance of a Soviet note on Berlin or in response to it. This possibility, he said, had been discussed in the Foreign Office. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said that it was a weakness of the West that it always seemed to be on the defensive and the courses of action he had discussed so far had all been defensive responses to Soviet moves. He saw a psychological advantage to the West taking the offensive and demanding something. He suggested as an offensive move that we propose the negotiation of an extra-territorial status for road and rail communications with Berlin. He also suggested that consideration might be given to stating that we would be willing to deal with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as agents of the Soviet Union in return for a guarantee to us that the extent and frequency of traffic would be maintained at the present level. He said it would be useful to have a fuller discussion of these ideas and problems. [First Secretary Osterheld of the German Embassy on the following day discussed this last idea with <gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss>—Mr. Vigderman. He pointed out the difficulty of arousing world opinion over, such technical questions as the stamping of travel papers. He thought that the above suggestion would have the virtue of focusing blame on the Soviet Union if they refused to accept what seemed like a plausible Western proposal and their rejection of the proposal would place the West in a much better position vis-à-vis Western opinion to take rigorous measures to maintain our access to Berlin without dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials.]<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">Brackets in the source text.</note></p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> then said he would like the Ambassador’s views on certain questions. Did he think that the Soviet Union and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would only move against military traffic or against all traffic, civilian and military alike? Would there be another full blockade of Berlin or only a limited blockade directed against the Western garrisons? This question had a crucial bearing on the magnitude of the actions which the West would have to undertake. For example, it directly affected the scale of our airlift planning.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> replied that one could not exclude from one’s calculations the possibility that a blockade would be extended to all civilian traffic. The legal basis for civilian traffic was not altogether clear, especially in the air. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LET1">Lampson</persName> asked whether the new clause in the interzonal trade agreement would have any bearing on this question. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> replied that it might.)</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_109" n="109" facs="0134"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> then asked for the Ambassador’s views on economic retaliation. Was Bonn studying the matter? What economic weapons are there in our arsenal which could be used effectively? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he recalled that one of the elements in this field—and it might be a substantial factor—was the dependence of the Federal Republic on brown coal from East Germany.</p>
<p>The Ambassador replied that the general results of the studies which had been made in Bonn had not been very encouraging. The Federal Government had often tried to find measures of retaliation and the only field where there seemed to be any prospects was that of interzonal trade. Even here the Germans felt there were no countermeasures which would be effective over the long run. The Soviet Zone was in the position to find alternate sources of supply for practically all of the goods which the Federal Republic could deny them. Moreover, the Soviet Zone could retaliate on its own part in the economic field by shutting off shipments of brown coal. If this were done, the supply of brown coal for Berlin would be seriously endangered.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> asked whether civilian traffic to Berlin was inspected by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel. The Ambassador replied that it was.</p>
<p>In concluding his remarks on economic countermeasures the Ambassador commented that it was in the nature of the Communist system to put a greater weight on political than economic factors. If they were embarking on a course of action for an important political objective they would not be deterred by economic counter-measures. They would be willing to force their populations to accept economic deprivations.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> and the Ambassador agreed to keep in very close touch. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> assured the Ambassador that we viewed the Soviet moves against Berlin very seriously. In our opinion this was not a limited action but represented the opening of a major political offensive over a broad front. He said that we were not going to let ourselves be pushed around. It was very important that the Western allies move in unison.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> set up a meeting for the Ambassador with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> at 10:30 on Monday morning.<note n="5" xml:id="d59fn5">In their meeting on November 24, <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> reviewed the terms of the trade agreement between East and West Germany signed on November 20, discussed the possibility of a tripartite démarche to the Soviet Union (see <ref target="#d63">Document 63</ref>), and reviewed the Western position on dealing with East German officials instead of Soviet representatives. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> also gave <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> a seven-page memorandum summarizing the legal and political opinions of the Federal Republic on the status of Berlin.

<dateline><placeName>Bonn</placeName>, <date when="1958-11-20">November 20, 1958</date>.</dateline>
<p>My Dear Friend Mr. Dulles: This morning Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Smirnov</persName>, the Ambassador of the Soviet Union, called on me to inform me officially that the Government of the Soviet Union intends in the next few days to denounce the “Occupation Statute” for the city of Berlin. The reason given for this is known to you from the statements of the Soviet Russian Prime Minister, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and from the statements in the Soviet Russian press, especially <hi rend="italic">Pravda.</hi></p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>, acting on my instruction, has already conferred with you about the consequences of the announced actions. I have his report on his conversation with you.<note n="1" xml:id="d60fn1">See <ref target="#d42">Document 42</ref>.</note></p>
<p>Herr <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> received the British Ambassador, Minister <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trimble</persName>, and Minister Leduc this afternoon and informed them about the conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA1">Smirnov</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">See <ref target="#d53">Document 53</ref>.</note></p>
<p>The close and friendly relations which link us together prompt me to tell you in all frankness about the grave anxieties that I feel on account of this impending development. The status of the free sector of the city of Berlin is of such decisive importance that I am certainly not putting it too strongly when I say that termination of the occupation of Berlin could not but have incalculable political consequences. I need not tell you in so many words how gratefully the entire German nation has noted the repeated statements by the Governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom and France to the effect that the preservation and protection of the freedom of Berlin is one of the imperative tasks of these three countries. The political actions announced by the Soviet Union are obviously designed to test the firmness and trustworthiness of the joint policy of the free world. I say <hi rend="italic">the free world</hi> advisedly, for in the communiqué issued at the conclusion of the deliberations of the chiefs of government of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> last December all the member states of the Atlantic Community without exception committed themselves to this obligation.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">For text of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué, December 19, 1957, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> January 6, 1958, pp. 12–15.</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_111" n="111" facs="0136"/>
<p>I am fully aware that we will all be taking a political risk if in the face of the impending decision of the Soviet Union we commit ourselves to this task without wavering, and are determined to act accordingly. However, I make no secret of my anxiety lest we impair the faith in this joint policy and the solidarity of the free world if the Soviet Union succeeds, possibly by roundabout ways or by stages, in undermining this policy. I am convinced that the Soviet Union will proceed astutely and warily. It will to begin with pretend that the transfer of the rights under the Four Power Agreement to the government of the so-called <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> will not in any way alter the present status. And it will, I believe, instruct the authorities of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> to keep up this pretense for the time being. If we acquiesce in this, a second step will follow. The <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> will, for example, take the position that free civilian traffic by air is no longer permissible but requires the consent of the authorities of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. This would make it impossible for hundreds of thousands of people to find their way to freedom via the city of Berlin. At first the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> will probably not cause any difficulties for the representatives of the three Western Powers and the troops stationed in Berlin; it will restrict the freedom of traffic between Berlin and the Federal Republic and finally halt it, on the alleged grounds of its sovereignty.</p>
<p>The political, economic and in particular the psychological reactions in Berlin and in Germany are incalculable. But in other parts of the world as well, including the members of the Atlantic Community, the fear will arise that an initial concession will not be the last. In the historic world-wide conflict between communism and the free world the Soviet Union would thus easily win the first and perhaps decisive battle.</p>
<p>I consider it urgently necessary that we face these dangers with all frankness and seriousness. I am also writing to the British Prime Minister, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, to the same effect.<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s message to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, see <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Riding the Storm,</hi> pp. 571–572.</note> As you know, I am meeting with the French Premier, General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, this coming Wednesday; we have already placed this question on the agenda of the conversation. Furthermore, I consider it highly desirable, even necessary, that we come together immediately in a meeting of the four Governments when the Soviet Union announces its action. We can then quickly agree on the time and place of such a discussion through our Ambassadors.</p>
<p>With sincere greetings,</p>
<p>As ever,</p>

<p>1058. Paris for Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>. Following are working level comments on British memorandum on Berlin made November 21 to British and French.<note n="1" xml:id="d61fn1">Regarding the conversation with <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>, see <ref target="#d59fn1">footnote 1, Document 59</ref>.</note></p>
<p>There are many motives, all sound from Soviet viewpoint, which could lead Soviets to exploit difficulties implicit in West’s commitment to freedom of city 100 miles inside Communist territory. We can only speculate why Soviets chose this particular moment to launch course of action which could have been undertaken at any moment for years past. Developments since <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> November 10 speech leave no doubt firm Soviet intention to hand over to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> responsibility for functions concerning Berlin now performed by Soviet organs. Exact timing and diplomatic cover to be thrown over action by Soviets not yet clear.</p>
<p>We consider immediate target is Allied communications with Berlin, rather than a blockade of inhabitants of Berlin.</p>
<p>We read memorandum as agreeing with us that under no circumstances could we permit creation of situation in which freedom of West Berlin compromised by starvation or otherwise. At appropriate point we would resort to force to make good on our commitment.</p>
<p>Our fundamental difficulty with UK memorandum is that alternative chosen (unrestrained dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> up to and including recognition if necessary) does not solve basic problem. It only postpones for a longer or shorter period point at which choice again becomes use of force or further yielding to pressure to save the city for the West. For it is our conviction that any arrangements with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> can only be temporary however ironclad they may seem. Berlin will still be isolated from rest of free world. Arguing from the intolerability of a foreign enclave within its territory, <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, backed by Soviets, can hardly be expected to exercise self-restraint necessary for stabilization of Berlin situation for very long.</p>
<p>Thus, following British line, you arrive at best at temporary point of stabilization. Since reunification (only real long-term solution Berlin problem) not envisaged within period temporary East-West truce over Berlin, dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> hardly justified as measure to gain time.</p>
<p>Moreover, UK estimate and ours of damage done to Western position by unrestrained dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> must be quite different. For the <pb xml:id="pg_113" n="113" facs="0138"/>sake of a temporary period of stabilization (the effective duration of which is still left fundamentally to Soviets and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) we will have compromised position on dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> with all that this implies in connection Allied-German relations and Allied prestige in rest of world. Recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> (and it would have to come to this ultimately, we think, however hard we resisted it) would accomplish a fundamental change in Soviet-Satellite relationships of inestimable advantage to Soviets and corresponding detriment to West. While Three Powers would no doubt be lauded in some quarters for having taken up “realistic” position in order avoid use of force, with all its implication in nuclear age, a staggering blow would have been dealt to confidence reposed by our Allies and rest of Free World in our firmness in face of threats, in a situation in which our legal right to insist on status quo was fairly precise.</p>
<p>Goal of German reunification on any terms suitable to West would have been practically surrendered. Soviets would have proved their thesis that reunification was a task for the two Germanies, each sovereign and able to take its place at negotiating table as equals.</p>

<p>On Saturday, November 22, at 6:30 p.m., I called the President to get his approval to a suggested note to the Russians, copy attached,<note n="1" xml:id="d62fn1">Not found, but see <ref target="#d63">Document 63</ref>.</note> which we hoped to coordinate with the British and French so that similar notes from the three powers could be delivered in Moscow on Monday morning, November 24.</p>
<p>I explained to the President that there had been numerous press speculations in regard to a split among the three powers. In addition, Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had written a letter to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> and to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and to the Secretary of State<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2"><ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> which outlined, though in reasonably <pb xml:id="pg_114" n="114" facs="0139"/>moderate terms, his own anxiety in regard to the situation and which, in the case of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, asked the latter to send a personal message to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> requesting him to hold off on his proposed unilateral action in Berlin.</p>
<p>I read to the President the message which <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had sent to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">For text of this message, in which <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> expressed his anxiety over <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s statements on Berlin, see <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Riding the Storm,</hi> p. 572.</note> and explained that this had been sent without consultation because <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> felt that the time element was important, and that I also felt this had been done with the possible view of counteracting the impression that the British were somewhat wobbly in the whole situation as reflected in a lower level statement of British views which had been circulated to the three powers and Germany.<note n="4" xml:id="d62fn4">See <ref target="#d45">Document 45</ref>.</note></p>
<p>I then told the President that neither we nor our Allies had received any message from the Russians and that our knowledge of projected acts came entirely from press reports and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s conference with the Russian Ambassador in Bonn.<note n="5" xml:id="d62fn5">See <ref target="#d53">Document 53</ref>.</note> For that reason, it occurred to us that we might take the initiative both in showing solidarity and in getting our views with respect to Russian responsibility with regard to the Quadripartite Agreements affecting Berlin out publicly before any Russian note was received by us. I then read him the text of the suggested note, and he approved it with the understanding that we would plan to coordinate it at once with the British and French.</p>
<p>His final comment with respect to the Berlin situation was that he had been thinking about it for the last few days and that his instinct was to make a very simple statement to the effect that if the Russians want war over the Berlin issue, they can have it. However, in a lighter vein, he said he would certainly hold off any such statement awaiting further developments.</p>

<head>63. Editorial Note</head>
<p>Following Acting Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s telephone conversation with the President (see <ref target="#d62">Document 62</ref>), the Department of State transmitted to Bonn and repeated to London, Paris, Moscow, and Berlin the text of a six-paragraph note to the Soviet Government stating that the Western powers would continue to hold the Soviet Union responsible for its obligations in Berlin and that it was “impossible to reconcile the Soviet Government’s protestations of a desire to relax international tensions with a threat of unilateral actions which cannot fail to increase tension in a highly sensitive area.” (Telegram 1067, November 22 at 8:52 p.m.; Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/11–2258)</p>
<p>The following day, the Embassy in London reported Foreign Office support for the démarche (telegram 2843; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.00/11–2358), but the Embassy in Paris reported that the Foreign Ministry believed the note was premature until definite Soviet proposals had been received. (Telegram 1921; <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>) Further representations by the United States in Washington and by the British and U.S. Ambassadors in Paris failed to change the French position, and on November 24 the Department of State proposed to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> that the note be delivered to the Federal Republic of Germany in order to get the Western position formally on the record. (Telegram 1072 to Bonn, November 24; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.0221/11–2458) This proposal was also rejected by the French. (Telegram 1956 from Paris, November 25; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.00/11–2558)</p>
<p>Lacking tripartite agreement on the proposed note, the U.S. Government dropped the idea.</p>

<p>1. In reference A you request my views and comments with reference to the prospect that Soviets will shortly turn over to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> all Soviet control functions in Berlin and East Germany and that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will not feel bound by any existing quadripartite agreements. The problems stated of course are far broader than that of access to Berlin.</p>
<p>2. In my view it is essential to inform the Soviet immediately and preferably without public announcement that we do not intend to recognize or deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>; that we will not allow the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to impede the exercise of any right we presently hold; that we will not accept any control by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> over our movements to and from Berlin; and that we will use force if necessary to enforce our rights.</p>
<p>3. But at the same time, we should try to sieze the initiative while we have the chance and broaden the base of allied support by proposing a four-power conference on Germany (I repeat on Germany not solely on Berlin). See message to State, reference F.</p>
<p>4. Obviously it is of the highest importance that France and Britain take the same unequivocal line. A major break between allies on this subject could lead to worse disaster than the loss of Berlin itself.</p>
<p>5. Unless we are willing to begin a humiliating process of yielding step by step to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, we must draw the line now and the Russians must understand we will use force to support this position if necessary. As for the tactics to be employed regarding access to Berlin: First, I suggest that the instructions which Embassy Bonn issued to cover individual travel to Berlin by Autobahn (reference B), and their instructions covering train travel (reference C) be applied on the broadest basis possible; second, we should continue to operate US military convoys as in the past so long as the checkpoints are under Soviet control, to the extent of even one Soviet representative being present on whom the responsibility can be placed. While we must maintain our rights, we should not now seek to force a test of Soviet control, in light of the larger problem which is developing. Third, if the checkpoints have been turned over completely to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control, we should choose a time and place to force the issue promptly by dispatching a test convoy supported by appropriate <pb xml:id="pg_117" n="117" facs="0142"/>force. It is not a question of the US forces in Berlin being able to defeat any force that could be brought against it, but of forcing into the open the fact that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, backed by the Soviet, is using violence to deprive the US of its established rights.<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">On November 25 the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent the following reply to <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>: “The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> concur that we should continue to operate U.S. military convoys as in the past so long as the checkpoints are under Soviet control to the extent of even one Soviet representative being present on whom the responsibility can be placed, and that although we must maintain our rights we should not now seek to force a test of Soviet control in light of the larger problem developing. Accordingly, on this basis you are authorized to resume normal military motor convoys between West Berlin and West Germany at your discretion. State concurs.” (<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Master Cable Files)</note></p>
<p>6. If an attempt is made to replace Soviet personnel with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel in <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>, the East Germans will be asked to leave and if need be, escorted out; and flight information on Western aircraft continue to be made available (reference E). The problems which may be anticipated incident to continued air travel between West Berlin and Germany include refusal of civil aircraft to enter into Berlin, with possible manning by US military crews, interference with radar and navigational aid, saturation of corridors by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Soviet aircraft, attempts to force aircraft to land and even interference with aircraft in flights.</p>
<p>7. The more I study this question the more I become convinced that we must take a very firm position in support of our rights and obligations in Berlin, and that this position be made known to the Russians. We may hope, as we do, that a show of determination may ease the situation but we cannot expect it to solve the problem. Therefore, we must balance our over-all position, we must make an effort to gain the initiative by more fundamental, longer range action as well. With all its apparent pitfalls and dangers, the idea of conference as suggested in reference F gains weight as we consider the consequences, the strengths and weaknesses of other courses of action. Finally, whatever we decide to do must be done quickly if it is to have any chance of success.<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">On November 26, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> discussed the Berlin situation with <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> who was in London for the dedication ceremony at St. Paul’s. <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> reiterated the views expressed in <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> 9–6265 and the Prime Minister “showed considerable interest, said he had been thinking of possible ‘summit meeting’ on German problem, and indicated he would probably be discussing matter with President and Secretary in near future.” (Telegram 1983 from Paris, November 27; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/11–2758)</note></p>

<p>The Pres returned the call and after exchanging amenities, the Sec said they were talking about Berlin and he referred to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s letter.<note n="1" xml:id="d65fn1"><ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> The Sec is rather disposed to answer it to the effect that while as far as we see it we would not perhaps see any great obstacles in dealing on a de facto basis with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> lower officials, nevertheless if from the Chancellor’s and <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>’s standpoint that would be interpreted as a sign of weakness and they want us to adopt a stronger line, we will. The Pres said the trouble with his scheme is—you say it but what do you do? The Sec said we would have to be prepared to send something through. The Pres mentioned his getting too rigid in his attitude that this actually constitutes recognition—he does not try to take them over by force—in his country there is a status quo rebellion. The Sec said he agreed not to use force to reunify Germany. The Pres said he wonders rather than doing it on an either-or basis if the Russians go out we deal with the lower levels on a de facto basis but that is that. We take no recognition action. They may say we will block—then we have to do something. The Sec compared it with Quemoy—one thing is reasonable but you have a psychological problem which is if doing that breaks the morale of one of your strong dependencies you have to take that into account. The Sec hates to run out on him. The Pres does not think he should. We recognize him but the only way to get back his Germany is for a peaceful agreement with the authorities there and so the Pres thinks he is a bit illogical. They are governing that area. The Sec said we have agreements with the Russians to get through. The Pres can see a place where we have to say we have to go through. The Sec thinks we should get some expression of our views to him before he sees <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> Wednesday.<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">See <ref target="#d75fn3">Document 75 and footnote 3</ref> thereto.</note> The Pres thinks so too.

<pb xml:id="pg_120" n="120" facs="0145"/>
<p><hi rend="italic">Begin text.</hi></p>
<p>“My Dear Friend:</p>
<p>On my returning this morning to Washington, I find your letter of November 20.<note n="1" xml:id="d67fn1"><ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> It deals with problems of the utmost gravity which, as you know, have been receiving the consideration of the President and myself as well as of the officers of the government. The presence here of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> a few days ago gave us the opportunity to talk over the Berlin problem.</p>
<p>Of course, the situation that we face is still hypothetical. The Soviets have given some indications as to their intentions but have not yet made these intentions precise or operative.</p>
<p>I am sure that our two Governments start from a common premise, often reiterated, that the abandonment of the free part of the city of Berlin is totally unacceptable, and this includes the rights of transit to and from the Federal Republic to Western Berlin. Our rights were won in the war, they are reflected in the Protocol of September 12, 1944<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, The Conferences at Malta and Yalta, 1945, p. 118.</note> and were reexpressed by the Soviet Union and the three Western Powers at the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers held in Paris in June 1949. It was there agreed that ‘as regards the movement of persons and goods and communications between the Eastern and the Western Zones and between the Zones in Berlin and also in regard to transit, the occupation authorities, each in his own zone, will have an obligation to take the measures necessary’<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">For text of the communiqué of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers Meeting, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., <ref target="frus1949v03">1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 1062–1065.</note> etc. Surely such an obligation, jointly agreed to, cannot be terminated by unilateral action.</p>
<p>I also recall that the directive agreed to at the Geneva Summit meeting of 1955<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4"><hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., <ref target="frus1955-57v05">1955–1957, vol. V</ref>, pp. 527–528.</note> stipulated that ‘the Heads of Government, recognizing their common responsibility for the settlement of the German question’ etc. Surely the question of Berlin is part of this ‘German question’, for which there is an agreed ‘common responsibility’ on the part of the four powers. This again is something from which the Soviet Union cannot unilaterally disengage itself.</p>
<p>I would myself have thought that it might be possible to hold the Soviet Union to its obligations and at the same time deal on a de facto basis with minor functionaries of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, so long as they merely carried out perfunctorily the present arrangements. That, in our opinion, would not and should not involve any diplomatic recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or any waiver of our rights vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. I believe that <pb xml:id="pg_121" n="121" facs="0146"/>the Federal Republic, itself, without this implying diplomatic recognition, deals in a number of respects with minor functionaries of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we recognize that there are psychological as well as purely juridical factors to be taken into account. Certainly we should not allow anyone to get the impression that there is any lack of firmness and dependability in the policies of the Western allies. Your views as to how best to display that firmness will carry great weight with us. The President and I have full confidence in your steadfastness and your judgment and your dedication to the cause of freedom.</p>
<p>So far, as we both recognize, the Soviet has not made known precisely what measures it will take. You consider it necessary that without delay there be a meeting of the four Governments when the Soviet Union makes its measures known. The United States would be glad to participate in such a meeting, although I cannot say in advance of knowing the date, at what level we could participate with the necessary promptness. But whoever speaks for us will have the full confidence and authority of the President and myself, if indeed I do not personally participate, which would be my preference if the timing permits.</p>
<p>With best regards, I am</p>
<p>Faithfully yours,</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>:</hi> I am ready to receive your questions.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, have the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany agreed on plans to meet any contingency which may arise in East Germany and Berlin?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The basic position of the three Western powers and, indeed, of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers is pretty well defined by prior decisions and declarations.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_122" n="122" facs="0147"/>
<p>You ask whether we have plans to meet any contingency. Of course, I can’t anticipate all the contingencies that there are, but I think that it is fair to say that there is basic agreement, and I do not anticipate any event that could arise which would give rise to disagreement.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, what is the position of the United States and the other powers on the question of dealing with any East German official who might be in a position previously held by a Soviet official?</hi></p>
<p>A. The position of the United States, and I think I can fairly say of the United Kingdom and of France, is that there is an obligation, an explicit obligation, on the part of the Soviet Union to assure to the United States and to the other allied powers and, indeed, to the world generally, normal access to and egress from Berlin. And that is the responsibility of the Soviet Union. It was expressed explicitly at the time of the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting held in Paris in June of 1949,<note n="1" xml:id="d68fn1">For background, see <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> of July 4, 1949, p. 857. [Footnote in the source text. The text of the final communiqué of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers Meeting is printed in <ref target="frus1949v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 1062–1065.]</note> following, you will recall, the end of the Berlin blockade and the consequent airlift. At that time the Four Powers exchanged what were formally called “obligations” to assure these rights. We do not accept the view that the Soviet Union can disengage itself from that responsibility. And, indeed, that responsibility was in essence reaffirmed at the time of the summit meeting of July 1955, when the Four Powers recognized their “responsibility” for the German question.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">For text of the Directive to Foreign Ministers, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Aug. 1, 1955, p. 176. [Footnote in the source text. The text of the Directive to the Foreign Ministers is printed in <ref target="frus1955-57v05"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1955–1957, vol. V</ref>, pp. 527–528.]</note> That phrase, “the German question,” has always been held to include the question of Berlin. And so, again, you had a reaffirmation by the Soviet Union of its responsibility in the matter. We do not accept any substitute responsibility, in that situation, for that of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Question of Dealing With East German Authorities</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, what if, despite this responsibility, the Soviets go ahead and turn over to the East German authorities the check points on the autobahn and control to the land, sea, and air routes? Now the question would arise: Would we deal with the East German officials who would man the check points, for example, even as—</hi></p>
<p>A. Well, we would certainly not deal with them in any way which involved our acceptance of the East German regime as a substitute for the Soviet Union in discharging the obligation of the Soviet Union and the responsibility of the Soviet Union.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_123" n="123" facs="0148"/>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Does that mean that we might deal with them as agents of the Soviet Union?</hi></p>
<p>A. We might, yes. There are certain respects now in which minor functionaries of the so-called G.D.R. [German Democratic Republic]<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">Brackets in the source text.</note> are being dealt with by both the Western powers, the three allied powers, and also by the Federal Republic of Germany. It all depends upon the details of just how they act and how they function. You can’t exclude that to a minor degree because it is going on at the present time and has been. On the other hand, if the character of the activity is such as to indicate that to accept this would involve acceptance of a substitution of the G.D.R. for the present obligation and responsibilty of the Soviet Union, then that, I take it, we would not do.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, can you deal with them in such a way as to make a distinction between dealing with them as agents of the Soviet Union and dealing with them in such a way as to imply a kind of de facto recognition of their existence?</hi></p>
<p>A. I think that that certainly could be done. We often deal with people that we do not recognize diplomatically, deal with them on a practical basis. Of course, we do that with the Chinese Communists in a number of respects. And, as I pointed out, both the Federal Republic of Germany and the rest of us have, in certain practical matters, for many months been dealing with minor functionaries of the G.D.R. with respect to what might be called perfunctory, routine matters.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, you say we might deal with the East Germans as agents of the Soviet Union. Is that a matter of agreed policy between the three Western powers and the Federal Republic or only something that is possible?</hi></p>
<p>A. I think that it is agreed between us that we <hi rend="italic">might.</hi> But, as I say, the question of whether we would or would not would have to depend upon the precise circumstances which surrounded the action, and that can’t be anticipated in advance of knowing what, if anything, the Soviet Union is going to do.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, supposedly authoritative dispatches from Bonn in the last few days have reflected a concern on the part of Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s government that the Western Big Three would not “hang on tough,” so to speak, in Berlin. On the other hand, it has been widely speculated in dispatches that many Western officials want more de facto recognition of the East German regime, and as an evidence of this has been cited the renewal of the trade agreement that has just been signed this week. Can you clarify that situation a little bit?</hi></p>
<p>A. I doubt if I can clarify it very much. There have been, as you point out, dealings on a de facto basis, particularly on an economic basis and <pb xml:id="pg_124" n="124" facs="0149"/>in terms of transit back and forth between the Western sectors of Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany. There has been an appreciable degree of de facto dealing with the G.D.R., and there is this trade agreement, whereby the Federal Republic gets particularly brown coal and things of that sort from the eastern part of Germany in exchange for certain manufactured goods. As to any differences within the Federal Republic about that, I am not in a position to throw light upon it. I am not aware of any differences which are of sufficient magnitude so that they have come to my attention.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Communist Probes To Be Expected</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, can you give us your view of why the Berlin crisis was reactivated at this time? I mean the Berlin situation between the East and the West. Do you have any idea of what the Communists had in mind?</hi></p>
<p>A. I was not surprised by it at all. I think that the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists—what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> calls “the international Communist movement”—is disposed periodically to try to probe in different areas of the world to develop, if possible, weak spots—to develop, if possible, differences. I think that the probing that took place in the Taiwan area was one such effort. Now it is going on in Berlin and could go on at other places. The effort is, I think, periodically to try to find out whether they are up against firmness and strength and unity. If they find that, then I think the probing will cease. But we have got to expect these probes coming from time to time. As I say, I was not surprised that this Berlin probe took place. Indeed, I thought it probably would take place.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, you seem to draw a limit beyond which we would not go in dealing with the East Germans even as agents of the Soviet Union. Could I ask whether we would refuse, for example, to accept an East German demand that special credentials would be required from the East German Foreign Office in order to allow the traffic to continue?</hi></p>
<p>A. I think it would be unwise for me to try to give categorical answers to very particular illustrations, because, obviously, this is a situation to be dealt with upon a tripartite or quadripartite basis. I think I had better just stand on the proposition that in my opinion it is the combined judgment of all four of us that nothing should be done which would seem to give the G.D.R. an authority and responsibility to deal with the matters as to which the Soviet Union has explicitly assumed an obligation to us and a responsibility to us.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, the Mayor of West Berlin said today that this crisis might provide an opportunity for a new discussion with the Soviets on German and European security questions. Sir, do you see any possibility of renewing that discussion in view of the past deadlock, and are there any new thoughts here</hi> <pb xml:id="pg_125" n="125" facs="0150"/><hi rend="italic">on tying the Russian idea of negotiating a peace treaty with German unification?</hi></p>
<p>A. I would hardly think that the present mood of the Soviet Union makes this a propitious time for such a negotiation. Actually, of course, we would in these matters be largely guided by the views of the Federal Republic of Germany, which is primarily concerned and which has a government with which we have the closest relations and in which we have the greatest confidence. Their views in these matters would carry weight with us. I have had no intimation of this kind from the Government of the Federal Republic.</p>
<p>[Here follow questions and answers on unrelated subjects.]</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, to return to the Berlin question for a moment, there have been a number of reports while you were away that the United States and the allies, rather than accept dealing with the East Germans, might resort to another airlift to supply the city. Is this being considered, or is our policy essentially one of keeping the ground communications open, come what may?</hi></p>
<p>A. Well, we have at the present time flights and facilities which we are using which involve various media. There is the air, which is used; there is the autobahn, which is used; there is a railroad, which is used; to some extent canals which are used. We do not intend to abandon any of our rights as regards any of these particular ways. Now, in just what proportions they would be used, that I can’t say. Indeed, I don’t know today in just what proportions the four different ways are being used. But I would think you can say that we would not abandon any of the rights which were explicitly reaffirmed in the agreement of June 1949.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr: Secretary, in the beginning Poland identified herself with the Soviet Union’s position on this Berlin matter. However, Poland wants more aid from us, and she has a vested interest in her western frontiers. Do you figure there is any possibility that Warsaw has given this position a second look, and, if so, is it remotely possible that this may be a partial explanation for Moscow’s delay in executing it?</hi></p>
<p>A. Yes, that is possible, because, if the Soviet Union takes the position that the Potsdam agreement is nonexistent, the consequences of that would be not to destroy our rights in Berlin, because they don’t rest upon the Potsdam agreement at all, but it might greatly compromise the territorial claims of Poland, which do rest upon the Potsdam agreement primarily.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Means of Access to Berlin</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, is it right to infer from what you said to Mr. [Chalmers]<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">All brackets in this paragraph are in the source text.</note> <persName corresp="#p_RSF1">Roberts</persName> [Washington Post and Times Herald] about not abandoning any of these means of attempts to get into Berlin that we would use these means, all of them, even if the East Germans or the Russians might try to block us?</hi></p>
<p>A. Yes, I think we would use all of them. Let me say, however, that nothing that has been said recently indicates that there is any intention or desire on the part of either the Soviet Union itself or the puppet regime, the G.D.R, to stop access to and from Berlin. The only issue that seems to have been raised is whether or not the Soviet Union can itself dispose of its responsibilities in the matter and turn them over to the G.D.R. But there has not been any intimation of any kind that the result of that would be a stoppage. It would be a shift of responsibility and authority.</p>
<p>Now, you will recall that at the time when we recognized the Federal Republic we reserved, in order to be able to carry out our obligations vis-à-vis the Soviet Union as regards access to and fro, we reserved out of the sovereignty which was restored to the Federal Republic the rights which we had as regards Germany as a whole and as regards Berlin, so that we did not disenable ourselves from carrying out the undertaking which had been expressed in the June 1949 agreement. And when the Soviet Union recognized the G.D.R., it made a somewhat comparable reservation so as to keep itself in the position to carry out its obligations under the June 1949 agreement.</p>
<p>And really the issue now is whether the Soviet Union can, by restoring all of these rights to what it recognizes as the government of East Germany, disenable itself from carrying out its obligations to us. And I think that, at least so far as it is exposed, the motivation at the present time would be not a purpose to drive us out of Berlin or to obstruct access to Berlin but to try to compel an increased recognition and the according of increased stature to the G.D.R.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, the last time this issue was up, without giving up any of our rights we did restrain ourselves from going forward on the ground, even though General <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName> at that time favored such a policy. And am I right in understanding you are now saying that we would go forward on the ground if we were blocked?</hi></p>
<p>A. I’d rather put it this way, that nothing that has been said or intimated indicates that that issue will arise. We do not intend to waive, either in fact or in law, any of the rights which we have. But I prefer not to speak in terms of a military threat, you might say, in relation to a situation which we have no reason to believe will occur.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_127" n="127" facs="0152"/>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Mr. Secretary, supposing that the question of a blockade did not come up but the East Germans insisted upon being dealt with as an independent nation rather than as agents of the Soviet Union, would we still insist upon using the three routes?</hi></p>
<p>A. I really think that I have clarified our position on these matters as far as it is useful for me to try to do it at this time, bearing in mind this is a tripartite or quadripartite matter. While I can state and have stated the common principles that are held and upon which we stand, I don’t think it’s wise for me to try, just on behalf of one of the four countries involved, to be more particular.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Q. Can I ask the question, Mr. Secretary, have we ruled out the possibility of using force to back up our right to unimpeded access to Berlin should the East Germans seek to stop us?</hi></p>
<p>A. We have not ruled out any of our rights at all. All I have said is that nothing that was said, which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> or anybody else in recent weeks has said, suggests that there is now any purpose on the part of either the Soviet Union or the G.D.R. to impede or obstruct our access by the various media that are available to us to and from Berlin. Therefore it seems to me that the question as to whether, if they did it, we would use force is an academic proposition because, as I say, nothing has happened to indicate that there is any present intention on their part to do that.</p>

<p>John Haskell left after lunch.</p>
<p>We spent most of the day talking about Berlin. In the Embassy we are unanimous, as are General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> and members of the Berlin Mission, in favor of cancellation of existing contingency instructions for travel in case Soviet personnel is replaced by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials at checkpoints. We have recommended replacing existing orders by a new set, <pb xml:id="pg_128" n="128" facs="0153"/>part of which would provide for an immediate turn-back of trains or vehicles if any documents should be demanded of their conductors by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> came to see me this afternoon. He said nothing interesting had transpired at the German Ambassador’s meeting yesterday. Today the Foreign Office is quiet for the Chancellor, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> and others are with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and his troupe at Bad Kreuznach.</p>
<p>Just before he left Washington, <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> talked to <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Bob Murphy</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">See <ref target="#d59fn5">footnote 5, Document 59</ref>.</note> and gained from him the impression we did not wish to resort to an airlift but would like to preserve our rights to surface access to Berlin, by force if necessary. I know there is considerable sentiment in this sense in high quarters of the Pentagon. The same idea is attributed to the President himself, although we have not been told here what may be contemplated in this regard. Obviously, the resources of our Berlin garrison are entirely insufficient for such a purpose if they were to be seriously challenged.</p>
<p>About 7 o’clock tonight a storm broke out over remarks attributed to the Secretary at his press conference in Washington this morning.<note n="3" xml:id="d69fn3">See <ref target="#d68">Document 68</ref>.</note> Our first information on the subject came from <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss> and indicated <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the Four Western Powers were in agreement on dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials as agents of the Soviet Government if the Soviets wanted to turn over their existing responsibilities to the East Germans. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> and others in Berlin were seriously alarmed<note n="4" xml:id="d69fn4">On November 27 the mission in Berlin reported that <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> was shocked and dismayed by the news reports on the press conference. (Telegram 412; Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/11–2758) In reporting press reaction, the mission stated that it ranged from “disbelief to dismay and downright anger.” (Telegram 416, November 27, 9 p.m.; <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>) An account of General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>’s recollection of the reaction to the press conference is included in his oral history interview at the U.S. Army Military History Institute.</note> and there will be a big play tomorrow about this in the German papers.</p>
<p>Before the <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> and Department Wireless Bulletin became available, I telephoned <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Livie Merchant</persName> to tell him how seriously we view the consequences of such a statement if indeed it had actually been made. He said he had read the transcript, and the <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss> story as related by me was based on a serious misinterpretation of what had actually been said. He will shortly send us the authentic text.</p>
<p>Later in the evening I received the exact transcript. As regards its effect on German public opinion, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with it. The Secretary displayed his usual ability to state the alternatives clearly, but in recognizing the possibility of regarding <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials as agents of the Soviets he is certain to alarm governmental and private circles here <pb xml:id="pg_129" n="129" facs="0154"/>to a high degree. In fact the excitement in Berlin is such that one of the Senators is flying down tonight to talk to <persName corresp="#p_WRG1">Rebecca Wellington</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d69fn5">First Secretary at Bonn.</note> about it.</p>
<p>This is another instance of what has always seemed to me to be the folly of discussing publicly diplomatic crises and negotiations when, as almost any reputable newspaper correspondent will admit, an answer from an official that a response would not be in the public interest would be accepted. Moreover, if the Soviet proposal has not already been prepared, it might have some influence on its content. In a lesser degree, the Secretary’s utterances some time ago comparing Quemoy and Matsu to Berlin had disturbing repercussions.<note n="6" xml:id="d69fn6">Not further identified.</note></p>

<head>The Soviet Note of November 27 and the Western Replies of December 31</head>

<head>72. Editorial Note</head>
<p>At 11 a.m. on November 27 Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> handed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> a 28-page note on the Berlin question. In this note the Soviet Government proposed that West Berlin be turned into a demilitarized free city with its own government. Following this transformation the four former occupation powers would guarantee the new status of the city in a manner similar to that done in Austria following the ratification of the Austrian State Treaty. Since some time would be necessary to work out the terms for the free city, the Soviet Union proposed not to introduce any changes in the existing system of military access to and from West Berlin, but if after 6 months Berlin had not become a free city, then the Soviet Union would tranfer its responsibilities in Berlin to the German Democratic Republic.</p>

<p>On the record press guidance confined to saying text not yet officially received. News agency text being studied and consultations with Allies will be next step.</p>
<p>Off the record guidance as follows: (1) note is based on premise that quadripartite obligations about Berlin have ceased to be valid and this we do not accept. (2) Whatever <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is offering to us, i.e. access to Berlin and quadripartite consultations about Berlin, he is offering as act of grace with six months time limit. These are rights which we enjoy <pb xml:id="pg_135" n="135" facs="0160"/>absolutely. (3) He seems to assume that West Berliners will be delighted at prospect of demilitarized “free city”. West Berliners will themselves no doubt express their views on this alternative to existing regime. (4) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> says that natural solution is for whole of Berlin to become part of “state” whose land surrounds it. We think that natural solution for Berlin is that it should be capital of reunited Germany. (5) Soviet Union cannot unilaterally renounce its Four Power obligations. If it chooses to give up its rights then in theory these rights revert to other three powers with whom agreements were made and not to G.D.R. Government.</p>

This would be better procedure than any special conference and would not attract much public attention. He added it would be very desirable if Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> could so arrange his schedule in Paris<note n="2" xml:id="d75fn2">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was scheduled to attend the North Atlantic Council Ministerial Meeting at Paris, December 16–18.</note> to make such a meeting possible.</p>
<p>He expressed himself as very pleased with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> visit to Bad Kreuznach.<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">For <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s record of this meeting on November 26, see <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> pp. 190–191. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> wrote that he assured the Chancellor that France would oppose any change in the status of Berlin.</note> Relationship between General and himself had been most cordial. He had talked privately for two hours with General on world politics and had found their views generally in accord.</p>
<p>In that part of meeting attended by respective advisers, two chief topics were reviewed: (1) Common Market and free trade area; (2) Berlin.</p>
<p>As to (1) General and he had decided to seek approval of the four members Common Market at forthcoming ministerial meeting and refer matter to Common Market commission under chairmanship of Hallstein, in attempt reach workable arrangement. I asked whether I was at liberty to mention this except to my own government, and he answered no, for Franco-German decision was still in course of being conveyed to other four members. He is seeing British <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> this afternoon and no doubt will communicate same to him.</p>
<p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said he had not had chance to study in detail various Russian notes on subject Berlin. He thinks they must be viewed against background of January Soviet Party Congress in Moscow and we should await conclusion that conference before fixing any definite Western decision. He does not want to have <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in position to boast during session Congress that he had sent a note and forced the four heads of Western governments to have meeting.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_137" n="137" facs="0162"/>
<p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had agreed with him that since <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> founding Soviets have made no advances in Europe, and that Berlin must continue to be garrisoned by Allied troops, since its loss would give Soviets almost fatal advantage over West.</p>
<p>Moreover, he said he had not made up his mind whether or when it would be necessary for four heads to convene. This could be discussed by <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s in Paris, but at any rate time for any such meeting was “not yet.”</p>
<p>Chancellor going to Berlin to spend Thursday and Friday next week and will make several speeches there. He is very calm and expects present excitement in German press to subside.</p>

<p>The Ambassador reported on the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">deGaulle</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> discussion of Berlin during which <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> had said that it is not possible to accept the transfer of power from the Soviets to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> even tacitly, including the idea of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials acting as agents.<note n="1" xml:id="d76fn1">See <ref target="#d75">Document 75</ref>.</note></p>
<p>The Secretary noted that we have contingency planning on this subject. He had tried to play this down in his press conference<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">See <ref target="#d68">Document 68</ref>.</note> but the press had, nevertheless, blown it up.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_138" n="138" facs="0163"/>
<p>The Ambassador said that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">deGaulle</persName> believed we must not separate on this issue but rather have firm positions. These we should take after we study the Soviet note. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">DeGaulle</persName>, he said, does not believe the Soviets will push to the ultimate end. Their aggression, additionally, will be lessened if we remain firm and united. This, of course, must include German resolutions.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that the Soviet note<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">See <ref target="#d72">Document 72</ref>.</note> was vicious and unacceptable.</p>

<p>426. Paris also pass <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> and West. Senator <persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName> and I called today on Governing Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> who received us in presence Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> and other Berlin officials and presented him with freedom bell. After exchange of pleasantries, and in response to Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>’s opening remarks about serious affairs, Senator said that he concerned at local press interpretation of Secretary’s Nov 26 remarks.<note n="1" xml:id="d77fn1">See <ref target="#d68">Document 68</ref>.</note> Senator stated that he would not criticize interpretation of remarks since they, or at least press reports of them, might give room to incorrect interpretation put upon them.<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2"><persName corresp="#p_HBB1">Hickenlooper</persName>, who had arrived in Berlin on November 27, cabled <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> earlier in the day that his press conference had caused “alarm and consternation” because of the reference to “agency”. He went on to say that any acceptance of an “agency principle” would and already had had a “catastrophic” effect on the U.S. position and prestige in Berlin and all of Germany. (Telegram 419 from Berlin; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/11–2858)</note> Senator stated that his experience <pb xml:id="pg_139" n="139" facs="0164"/>Foreign Relations Committee, and particularly his close relationship with Secretary, enable him reassure Berlin officials that in his opinion Secretary had not implied U.S. considering any “general theory of agency.” Senator emphasized that press had failed sufficiently stress positive parts of Secretary’s remarks, namely that we hold and will continue hold Soviets fully to their occupation responsibilities.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> thanked Senator for reassurance and expressed opinion that main source of misinterpretation was unfortunate comparison made between technical contacts between East and West Germans and Allied contacts with East Germans. <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> interjected that it true Soviets had transferred certain functions involving Germany to East German officials (even before establishment <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) but that it was another kind of thing for Soviets.</p>
<p>Transfer occupation rights vis-à-vis Allies to East Germans. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> agreed forcefully with <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName>’s opinion that Allied acceptance “agency theory” would qualitatively change Allied legal and actual position in Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> noted it perhaps fortunate that recent Russian note has thrust speculation concerning Secretary’s remarks into background. As result initial nervousness over these remarks on part some Berliners, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> noted parenthetically he had been criticized for not immediately telephoning Secretary or flying to the U.S. to talk to him as <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>’s critics assert Mayor Reuter would have done.</p>
<p>Senator and <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> then discussed general economic situation in a Soviet Zone and West Berlin. Governing Mayor expressed particular concern at fearfulness re Berlin’s future status and ability to perform contracts on part some Western businessmen and threat this attitude posed to continuing economic development West Berlin. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> stressed a most important task was to counteract such dangerous uncertainty.</p>
<p>In general discussion refugee situation <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> remarked that <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> in <hi rend="italic">Daily Mail</hi> interview indicated communist intention turn West Berlin sector border into state border with accompanying intensified controls.</p>
<p>In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> told Senator, “Despite minor misunderstandings Berliners rely on their friends abroad and even though the pressure is intensified our friends abroad can rely on the Berliners. The spirit that carried the Berlin population through the blockade is still present.” The Senator noted that he had come to Berlin on this, his sixth or seventh, trip because of the current increased tension and that while here he also wished to assure the Governing Mayor that the recent American elections had not in any way changed U.S. basic policy. Senator referred with approval to Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName>’s recent statement concerning <pb xml:id="pg_140" n="140" facs="0165"/>Berlin<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> had visited Berlin for 6 hours on November 23 and been briefed on the situation by <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BFJ1">Burns</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>; toured West Berlin; and held a joint press conference with the Mayor at which he reiterated the U.S. position on Berlin. A brief report on his visit was transmitted in despatch 397 from Berlin, December 4.

<p>Dear Bourke: I have your telegram from Berlin.<note n="1" xml:id="d78fn1">See <ref target="#d77fn2">footnote 2, Document 77</ref>.</note> You are, I think, quite right in assuming that my press conference statement in answer to a question was grossly misinterpreted. If you will read the full press conference, of which I enclose a copy,<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">Not found attached; see <ref target="#d68">Document 68</ref>.</note> I think you will come to the same conclusion. What happened was that the wire services quickly sent out a “flash” in an effort to get something sensational.</p>
<p>I could hardly have said that we would not under any circumstances deal with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as agents of the Soviet Union because in fact that is the basis upon which we are now dealing with them in some <pb xml:id="pg_141" n="141" facs="0166"/>respects. Also, and this is for your confidential information, there has been in existence for several years a contingency paper agreed to by the British, French and ourselves calling for precisely such a handling of the situation. You will note that I said that “if the character of the activity is such as to indicate that to accept this would involve acceptance of a substitution of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for the present obligation and responsibility of the Soviet Union, then that, I take it, we would not do.”</p>
<p>My press conference is replete with the strongest possible statements as to holding the Soviet Union to its responsibilities. It is really shocking what a false impression can be given on so little evidence. I would have thought that my reputation established over the years of being “tough” would have led to skepticism that in fact all of a sudden I was turning “soft.”</p>
<p>I am leaving for Mexico for the Inauguration on Sunday morning and then to San Francisco for a speech, so that I will not be back here until the latter part of next week. Meanwhile, I thank you for your telegram and confirm your confidence that I am strong for the maintenance of a firm position in Berlin. I think the statement that I gave out yesterday, of which I also enclose a copy,<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">Not found attached; see <ref target="#d72">Document 72</ref>.</note> bears this out.</p>

<p>Daridan suggests there are three alternatives for handling Soviet proposal:</p>
<list>
<item>1. Refuse it out of hand.</item>
<item>2. Try and seek a limited solution for Berlin itself. This would probably prove ruinous for Berlin.</item>
<item>3.

<p>2. I referred to the Soviet note of November 27 on Germany and Berlin and suggested that despite its hostile tone we need be in no hurry to reply. I thought that the occasion called for a thorough review of our whole policy on German reunification, and that in our reply to this <pb xml:id="pg_143" n="143" facs="0168"/>Soviet note we should not only reject it but also advance some constructive proposals of our own. The President agreed.</p>
<p>I referred to the importance of Berlin as an outpost and showplace of freedom. The President agreed but expressed unhappiness that here is another instance in which our political posture requires us to assume military positions that are wholly illogical.</p>
<p>I said that there is in prospect a meeting in Paris on December 15 of the Foreign Ministers of the US, Britain, France and the Federal Republic. It has been suggested that this might be followed by a meeting of the Heads of the same Governments thereafter. I thought this would have little point, although it might develop that at a later stage a meeting with the Russians at Head of Government level would be desirable. I said that I would in any event try to submit to the President new constructive proposals about Germany prior to the December 15 meeting.<note n="1" xml:id="d80fn1">For text of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ statement following his conversation with the President, which included a reaffirmation of the U.S. position on Berlin, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> December 22, 1958, p. 994.</note></p>

<p>429. Paris: <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> and West. From <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>. I had talk with <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Willy Brandt</persName> this afternoon.<note n="1" xml:id="d81fn1"><persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> visited Berlin November 30–December 1, largely to participate in the dedication of the new Hilton Hotel in the city; see <ref target="#d83">Document 83</ref>.</note> His thoughts summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Allies should deal not with problem of Berlin alone but rather of whole of Germany.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_144" n="144" facs="0169"/>
<p>Thinks Soviets have not presented a minimum but maximum program. Believes it not probable Soviets would go to war at this time. Might even agree to closer relationship between West Berlin and West Zone if they had a quid pro quo, especially in way of shutting off flow of refugees, and stopping freedom of movement of secret agents. Best solution from Soviet standpoint would be to take over Berlin, but this is not politically realistic. Soviets can already stop refugee movement if they apply their energies and facilities to it. Therefore, will probably institute strictly controlled boundary line in Berlin. Refugee question and that of underground activities is not their only motivating force, for prestige is also involved.</p>
<p>2. Re agency relationship between <gloss target="#t_GER1">Ger</gloss> and Soviet Govt. Berliners astonished as they would not have been a week previously, because <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> who was here preceding week had expressed himself as thinking such a concept quite impossible. As result of this, and conversations between <persName corresp="#p_KG1">Klein</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SAHV1">van Scherpenberg</persName>, Berlin authorities had concluded whole idea had been given up and Allies would resort to airlift, or even maintenance of surface access by force. Theoretically, de facto recognition even on an ad hoc basis would not have been so alarming to Berlin authorities, if there were not a psychological aspect as well. Consequently, the acceptance by Allies of any assertion of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authority at check points as agents of Soviets would now be disastrous. This matter, however, had been at least momentarily obscured by Soviet note, but the feeling just expressed still remained. This would be regarded as first step on slippery slope.</p>
<p>3. Maintenance of US garrison in Berlin is most important single thing US can do. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> would prefer it to be strengthened in sense of seeming to have been even if substantially little military weight were added. Showing of new units in streets would be useful.</p>
<p>4. Berliners would like <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> to be prepared to break off diplomatic relations with Soviets, but would not expect other nations to do it. However, cannot suggest such move at this time, in view standstill nature of Soviet note. This action should be reserved for possible future use.</p>
<p>5. Berliners do not want repetition of guarantees; US at appropriate time should again refer to them, but they should be taken for granted.</p>
<p>6. There should be a statement by Allies that Soviet proposal is under study and an answer will be forthcoming. The eventual reply should present Western case even if not directly responsive to substance of Soviet note. Believes no immediate response or acknowledgement of Soviet note is required but there should be a preliminary answer in early January.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_145" n="145" facs="0170"/>
<p>7. One matter is of overriding importance. Namely Soviet understanding that effective interference, especially on air routes, with Allied military communications between West Germany and Berlin will entail US war directly against Soviet Union.</p>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> thinks he should be invited to attend Paris meeting of four Foreign Ministers during that part of it devoted to Berlin problem. He intends taking this up with Chancellor next week.</p>
<p>9. He does not intend to make visit now to United States. He had been invited to do so some time ago by <gloss target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss> but is inclined to postpone acceptance until next year. I advised him to stick to this decision.</p>

<p>1160. Paris pass <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> and West. Immediate objective Soviet note seems clear. The Four Power Agreements on Berlin have been denounced and Soviet action will follow in 6 months or less, as specified in the note. Since the West is unanimous in rejecting a “free demilitarized city of Berlin”, there is no alternative to our taking the position that we will maintain our garrisons in Berlin. We cannot long maintain garrisons as Soviet note suggests by dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Therefore, we must make clear (a) we will not deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, (b) we will maintain our garrisons, (c) our readiness to use force against any interference our access to Berlin. If we are not prepared to deal with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, our surface access routes will probably be denied to us. Whether we can maintain our air access will depend on (a) the extent to which the Soviets and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> are prepared to interfere with our planes, and (b) the extent to which we are prepared to resort to force in order to overcome such interference. These are the immediate practical politicomilitary aspects of the Soviet note. However, the note has broader implications than those relating to Berlin, and these concern the future of <pb xml:id="pg_146" n="146" facs="0171"/>Germany and of the Western Alliance itself. The note is a move, couched in diplomatic form, but in reality directed to, and operating on, public opinion in Germany and the West in general. By the act of its publication, the note unleashes powerful pressures on German opinion in the direction of reaching some kind of accommodation with the Soviet Union through negotiation.</p>
<p>In the last year, the idea of disengagement has been repeatedly brought to the fore by the different versions of the Rapacki plan, by the public utterances of supporters of this general concept, e.g., George Kennan.<note n="1" xml:id="d82fn1">In 1957 Kennan delivered a series of lectures over the <gloss target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss> on international relations. Texts of the six talks are printed in George F. Kennan, <hi rend="italic">Russia, the Atom, and the West,</hi> London, 1958. Extracts from the talks and the reaction to them is in George F. Kennan, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs, 1950–1963,</hi> Boston, 1972, pp. 229 ff.</note> While there has been no wavering in the official Western reaction, the ground beneath the principal members of the Alliance is [of] varying degrees of hardness. In the case of the British it may be said to be definitely soft. The significance of the note is that it greatly encourages those elements in Germany and in the rest of the West who are in favor of reaching some kind of accommodation in Central Europe which will, in their view, appease the Soviets.</p>
<p>The six months deadline is perhaps less important in relation to the Berlin question, than in its effect on Western opinion and attitudes. It might be called, from the Soviet viewpoint, a period of “incubation” during which pressures will be generated which may compel the Western governments to negotiate with the Soviet Union on a basis which will place them at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Therefore it would appear that the task at the December 15<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">At this time tentative agreement had been reached for a Western four-power Foreign Ministers meeting at Paris on December 15.</note> Foreign Ministers meeting should be (1) to reach agreement on a common interpretation of the objectives of the Soviet Union as revealed by their note; (2) to make recommendations on what should be done with regard to Berlin (the Germans should be encouraged to come up with ideas); (3) to make recommendations on the substance and timing of a reply to the Soviet note.</p>
<p>If we intend to maintain our garrisons in Berlin beyond the expiration of the Soviet deadline, the Soviets should be put on notice of such determination and we should say nothing which might lead them to infer that we would not use force to maintain our land and air access.<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">In telegram 2993 from London, December 3, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJH1">Whitney</persName> expressed his agreement with <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>’s analysis and recommendations, but also proposed that a program building up Berlin’s stocks of coal and nonperishables should be initiated at once to show Western determination to remain in the city.

<p>1161. Paris pass <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> and West. During two day visit to Berlin I talked with many German political leaders, American military and civilian officials and journalists.</p>
<p>A few impressions are clear:</p>
<p>1. As long as Allied garrisons, especially United States, remain in West Berlin, the morale of its citizens will be at least moderately satisfactory, on the assumption the presence of such garrisons means that under certain circumstances the United States would be ready to go to war with the Soviet Union in order to defend its rights in Berlin.</p>
<p>2. At present the factor most adversely affecting morale is the fear that the United States might be prepared to deal at some level, even though it might be on minor points, with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> official representatives. This sentiment is expressed most immediately in connection with the possible turnover of checkpoint controls by the Soviets to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. An acceptance by the Allies of an agency or other relationship in this respect would be almost unanimously condemned. In spite of the six month waiting period specified in the Soviet note, there are some Berliners who believe Soviets may soon face us with checkpoint controls delegated to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel. Suggest speedy revision existing Tripartite Agreement to conform to recommendations <gloss target="#t_USBER1">USBER</gloss> 400 to Department<note n="1" xml:id="d83fn1">See <ref target="#d71fn2">footnote 2, Document 71</ref>.</note> be made, and favorable United States Government decision thereon be pressed for adoption by our Allies. Until this is done, I fear leak of current instructions may occur, and consequences would be extremely dangerous and certainly shattering to our prestige.</p>
<p>3. Although generally believing an attack upon our garrison would result in United States-Soviet war, there is doubt whether we would use force if required to maintain access to Berlin. Again opinion is almost unanimous we should be prepared to fight for preservation access rights, and Soviets and East Germans should be convinced such is our determination.</p>
<p>Scepticism over our ability militarily to force our way through by train or autobahn is widely prevalent. However, even if such scepticism proved justified, Berliners feel strongly we should nevertheless continue to assert our right to resume interrupted traffic and our intention to do so by force, if the occasion warrants.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_148" n="148" facs="0173"/>
<p>As to access by air, there is confidence in our ability to maintain our access, provided we intend, and orders are issued, to protect this traffic by appropriate force even at risk of war. Please refer to <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1334, October 27, 1957,<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">In telegram 1334 <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> reported that the passage of East German aircraft through Allied air corridors to Berlin was a question of “capital importance” about which the United States should make no concessions. Refusal of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> use of these corridors should be backed by employment of fighter aircraft to intercept <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> aircraft to show the Soviets that the United States would be neither bluffed nor intimidated. (Department of State, Central Files, 962.72/10–2757)</note> written for somewhat different circumstances but in principle applicable.</p>
<p>4. Many see in Soviet note opportunity for West to take hard line in refusing Berlin proposals while making counter propositions that would bring under discussion problems affecting whole of Germany.</p>
<p>I talked only to one German journalist, publisher Axel Springer. He has recently been stout in demanding firm stand by Berliners and Allies against turnover to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, is in close contact with Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>, and after long lapse again received by Chancellor. He confirmed, in the expression of his own views, the reactions I have before referred to.</p>

<p>1208. Because of importance subject sending verbatim memorandum dictated by Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> on his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d84fn1">The meeting was held on December 1. For <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName>’s published version, see <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> January 12, 1959, pp. 80–91.</note> with respect to Berlin question. Senator is convinced that chief purpose in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s mind in holding this long conference was to impress him with Soviet position on Berlin and to convey his words and thoughts to President.</p>
<p>“On Berlin. I may be very sketchy on this because it was talked about so often and interrupted by other thoughts.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_149" n="149" facs="0174"/>
<p>“The Berlin question was opened by myself after a hint or two from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. At least three times during conversation I told him my views must not be interpreted as as even views of Democratic party, much less those of government. I was speaking simply as a Senator having an informal talk with leader of a great country. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had mentioned Berlin as being thorn in relationships of four powers. He called it a cancer. I told him that I hoped USSR understands seriousness of our purpose in Berlin and that our position is firm and fully supported by both political parties and by our people. He knew of my visit to Berlin and what I had said.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">See <ref target="#d77fn3">footnote 3, Document 77</ref>.</note> He said, ‘I understand this but you must demonstrate some understanding of the real situation.’ He referred to Potsdam Agreement and US violations. In view of violations, he felt there was no reason to keep agreement of Four Powers on Berlin. This was his excuse. He said he has long been concerned over Berlin. That it is of no use to West militarily. That the 25,000 troops in Berlin surely can’t have any military significance unless we seek to wage an aggressive war. That Berlin to him meant nothing when the Soviet Bloc had 900 million people in it already. He said he had given many months of thought to Berlin situation and had finally come up with his proposal of a socalled free city. He said, ‘I don’t want to do anything detrimental to the other three countries.’ He said he felt his proposals were reasonable but if anyone had anything else to suggest he would be very happy to consider it. In fact he wanted suggestions. ‘But if you try to talk about German reunification the answer is no. There are two German states and they will have to settle reunification by themselves.’ He will never agree to liquidation of socialist system in East Germany nor would West agree to liquidation of Federal German Republic and its system, so why should Four Powers use city of Berlin as bargaining point. Berlin ought to stand alone, separate from reunification. He stands for establishment of a free city. He volunteered that he would support observers from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to guarantee non-interference and fulfillment of commitments. He talked at length about Austrian question and said Soviets had suggested withdrawal of troops and neutrality. He told me at length how Molotov had opposed this and he had responded to Council of Ministers and to Molotov that Russian troops in Austria were only worthwhile if Russia intended to expand westward and he didn’t want to do that. He wanted peace, not war, so why troops in Austria? A neutral Austria was established and a source of conflict was removed. His proposals on Berlin have similarity, except that Berlin is surrounded by East German Republic and that best proposal was free city with no troops because troops represented source of conflict, as he put it, and always offered element of danger. He said, ‘Now the three powers want to maintain <pb xml:id="pg_150" n="150" facs="0175"/>troops in Berlin, but why? 25,000 troops in Berlin are of no importance unless you want to make war. Why do you maintain this thorn? A free city, a free Berlin, could lead to the breaking of the ice between USSR and USA.’ At this point he became very firm and his voice rose. Some of your military men have made stupid statements lately—statements to effect that US will break through with tanks if East German Republic tries to get in the way. Soviets have tanks too, lots of them, and I warn you we will use them. We have rockets, too, and we don’t even have to fire them from East Germany. We can send them from USSR. So don’t threaten me by talking about breaking through with tanks. Might does not make right. Right makes might. Military argument is no answer. Our troops remain there (speaking of Berlin and East German Republic both) not to play cards. We mean business. Unless there is an agreement Soviets will carry through as suggested. This is territory of German Democratic Republic.’ I reminded him that it was not, that it was a separate arrangement and he reminded me that it was in heart of German Democratic Republic and obviously should belong to German Democratic Republic, but he was not proposing this, in fact he was preparing to give Soviet guarantees of its complete independence. ‘We are not suggesting anything offensive to US. You constantly talk of assuring freedom of two million Berliners. This is mere pretense for you to keep your troops there. I warn you this is very serious. Give us a counter proposal. We want to do away with this thorn of troops in the area and the Soviet is very suspicious that West Germany is being armed with these weapons to make war on East Germany. I know that you do not decide these affairs, but you will play a part. You are a member of the Democratic majority and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.’ I asked, if Berlin is to be a free city, what will Soviets do to guarantee access to Berlin, to guarantee freedom in fact, and to prevent it from being starved out. Khrushchev said ‘We are prepared to accept anything reasonable, ‘what do you suggest?’ I repeated my question, ‘What will you do to guarantee freedom of city—by this I mean access. We remember blockade of 1948 and airlift, and we don’t want to see the city strangled.’ Khrushchev said we could enter into an agreement to guarantee access registered with UN. He is ready to sign treaty with US, France and UK. He repeated he thought it would be good to have permanent UN observers there. ‘We want to cut this knot which spoils relations between the four powers.’ I asked, ‘Did I understand you to say that German reunification could only come as a result of an agreement between what you call the two Germanys?’ Khrushchev said, ‘Absolutely.’ He would not take part in any discussion relating to German reunification. He seeks a peace treaty on the question of Germany. There are two Germanys for time being. He mentioned phrase ‘for time being’ four times. ‘Any other settlement but an agreement between the two Germanys will <pb xml:id="pg_151" n="151" facs="0176"/>come only through force. An attack on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is war and we will support our partner in that war.’ I asked, ‘Do you see any hope for German reunification in the future?’ <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied ‘Yes. A kind of confederation with an all-German government.’ By that he meant a government that included both East and West Germany. He said then, ‘There ought to be a withdrawal of foreign troops, maybe slowly.’ I asked, ‘Does this mean that West Germany would have to be out of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>?’ He said, ‘I don’t attach much importance to this.’ Then he made a snide comment that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would disappear anyhow. I said ‘How about the Warsaw Pact, will it disappear?’ He said ‘Yes, any time now.’ Then he went on to give me an example of how plans go wrong—how plans for defense or attack sometimes have no relationship to real situation. This was effort on his part to show that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had outlived any usefulness it ever had from his point of view, and that while we were putting our faith in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Soviets were winning the economic war in the underdeveloped areas. He mentioned again that Soviet Union would not make war on Western Europe. ‘Why should we? We are waging economic competition.’ He went on to point out that Western Europe was realistic and when they saw Soviet economic progress in underdeveloped areas they would want to do business with Soviet Union. He didn’t develop this much more. I gathered his inference was that Western Europe looked too good to be destroyed. He would rather pick it up through economic attrition or by control over markets and raw materials, thereby forcing Western European economies to bend toward Soviet Union. That is just my personal analysis of what he was talking about. His reference to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> being outmoded or the wrong kind of defense related to his participation in defense of Kharkov, where Russians had prepared series of defense lines against forthcoming German attack, but Germans didn’t attack where defense lines were, in fact, they went in completely different direction and took defense lines with hardly a shot. ‘We will advance with our economy, so with your <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> maybe you have prepared for the wrong attack. We will fight you economically and you should welcome it.’ All during entire conference he went on about economic competition.</p>
<p>“<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that if we settle this question of Berlin everything will be better. ‘It is a bone in my throat.’ Again he went back to Austria and to visit of Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">Austrian Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_RJ1">Raab</persName> visited the Soviet Union July 21–28.</note> He said if Berlin is settled he could assure me that relations with all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries would improve. I assured him that we were reasonable but that we had promised Berlin freedom and we wanted no political strangulation and would not lend ourselves to any deal that would result in such strangulation. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, ‘We are prepared to cooperate with you. It would mean <pb xml:id="pg_152" n="152" facs="0177"/>much to the socialist countries for them to keep their word. A good reputation is important.’ Then he went on to say about Soviet Union, ‘Our firm is a good one and we want a good reputation. It would weaken us if we violated our word or if we let others do so.’ (I imagine referring to East Germany because I had told <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> we were of opinion his word would be final so far as East Germany was concerned and we wanted to negotiate with Russians and not with East Germans.) ‘It would be important for us to prove that we would not strangle the city—that we would keep our word to guarantee equal access to West Berlin of all countries.’ He asked me to tell President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> about this and again became very serious and said Berlin situation had to be settled—he was not going to back down. He again asked me, ‘What are your counter proposals, what do your Secretary of State and your President suggest?’ He repeated several times ‘Don’t threaten me.’ I told him I would be happy to talk this over with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and the President and asked him if I might repeat conversation in detail, and he said ‘Of course.’ At this point he showed sentimentality. ‘I have the deepest respect for President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. I like President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. We want no evil to the US or to free Berlin. You must assure the President of this.’ He said, ‘You must remember that many of your friends, the English and French, do not really want a reunited Germany. They are afraid of German reunification. USSR is not afraid. Situation isn’t like it was before war. US and Soviets need have no fear of a reunited Germany.’ Then he said, ‘Let’s test our mutual strength by economic competition. If USSR and <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> are on same side on this Berlin issue or any other there will be no war—only madman or fool would think of such a thing.’”</p>
<p>Senator made clear that in foregoing when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> used word Berlin he was referring to West Berlin.</p>

<p>1226. In my opinion both Soviet note and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s remarks to Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d85fn1">See <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note> tend to confirm that principal immediate explanation of Soviet action is desire to remove an impediment to further development of Communism in East Germany (and possibly Poland). The Soviets have never shown themselves capable of tolerating any deviation within their system and emphasis of past year in entire Communist Bloc has been toward orthodoxy and away from revisionism. I believe most important element for Soviets is the escape route for refugees. The flight of doctors and intellectuals has shown the difficulties of bringing East Germany into line so long as the Berlin escape route is open.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s long range objective is also clear, that is to absorb Berlin into <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has himself stated that our troops in Berlin serve no military purpose and he obviously would like to remove the guarantee they constitute of the continued freedom of West Berlin. I think it fair to state, however, that Khruchchev is also probably genuinely concerned at the threat to peace which could arise over the Berlin problem once Western Germany is fully armed.</p>
<p>While I think it would be possible to devise a solution to the Berlin problem which would be acceptable to us and reduce the current dangers in this situation, I do not see any solution likely to be acceptable to the Soviets which did not cut off the escape route and this I presume we could never accept. It is, of course, possible that if we show sufficient determination and unity, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would accept some solution not fully satisfactory to him as a way of backing down from the dangerous situation in which he has placed himself. In any event I suggest we should be prepared to put forward counter proposals if only to strengthen our position in the event of a showdown and to increase unity among the Western powers. As a first step, however, believe we should make strong refutation distortions and lies in Soviet note and firm statement our intention maintain our rights by force if necessary. Reply should offer discuss the problem provided we have reasonable counter proposals to put forward.</p>

<p>1232. <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 927.<note n="1" xml:id="d87fn1">Telegram 927, December 6, reported that Austrian and German diplomats were told by Soviet officials that the Soviet Union would agree to include the Eastern sector of Berlin in a city to be placed under U.N. protection, and asked if the Embassy in Moscow had heard similar reports. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/12–658)</note> Question of reason for East Berlin’s exclusion from “free city” plan was put informally by Western diplomats to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on November 28 and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on November 29. Points made in their replies were that unification of two parts of city <pb xml:id="pg_155" n="155" facs="0180"/>with different social systems would be as unrealistic as reunification Germany, that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> capital and government were actually in East Berlin, that East sector was closely tied to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in economic matters, and that future moves toward “confederation” required each German state to have own territory and capital.</p>
<p>To these typically Soviet arguments might be added Moscow’s desire to preserve control of all territory now effectively in its orbit and Kremlin unwillingness to let citizens of Communist area vote overwhelmingly for non-Communist parties (as East Berliners probably would if given chance).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we should by no means exclude possibility that Soviets not only have various fallback positions on Berlin for possible eventual use, but also have number of further moves planned for next six months to keep their initiative on question and to keep West off balance. Such moves need not be limited to pressure tactics but could include political devices to make <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> proposal less unattractive.</p>
<p>In this context, Soviet offer to include East Berlin is conceivable, and would undoubtedly be appealing to many because for first time since Berlin crisis started, East would also appear to be offering tangible concession to “reasonableness”. No doubt Soviets are genuinely reluctant to try this approach on above-noted grounds, and it is logical for them to be sounding out “third parties” and dropping hints to test reactions of West. If Western governments seem to reject it firmly, this might increase Soviet willingness to make offer (on theory that it is unlikely to be accepted), but they might still do it even though they expected to be called on to implement proposal.</p>
<p>Only specific rumor I have heard here is that reported <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1193.<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">Telegram 1193, December 2, reported that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kroll</persName> heard that the Presidium had discussed the possibility of including East Berlin in a free city, but had rejected the proposal as a step backward. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/12–258)</note> Since Presidium discussions of this importance do not leak accidentally this must be either purely speculative rumor or else deliberate plant.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note></p>
<p><gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> made certain comments but said not necessary to answer at this session except as we individually wished.</p>
<p>His chief observations were:</p>
<p>1. Does not think definitive answer to Soviet note can be produced at or immediately after Paris meeting, since answer should be complete and leave no false Soviet statement uncontradicted. Personally favors a preliminary answer for delivery early January. Replies would be made by individual governments, would contain same substance but variations in form.</p>
<p>Steel thought preliminary reply should be sent around Christmas. <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Seydoux</persName> expressed view <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué might serve as preliminary response and would take place of proposed note. I remarked I thought decision this point could well await <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s Paris conference.</p>
<p>2. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said, now that Senat and other officials Berlin, as well as many people <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and elsewhere generally familiar with content standing orders traffic to and from Berlin, Allied intention regard substitution Soviet by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials certain to be increasingly criticized in Berlin where it is already hot issue. He feels in any event since receipt of Soviet note <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials cannot plausibly be treated as Soviet agents. Therefore, in opinion <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> Govt, standing orders should be reexamined immediately and, it hopes, changed.</p>
<p>Steel observed present orders were still satisfactory but he will report request for re-examination to his govt. His govt has no intention recognizing <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> but this question standing orders is relatively unimportant compared with the larger problems needing consideration. (It has long been evident <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> favors continuance present system.) <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Seydoux</persName> said he would seek instructions from his govt. I said US Govt <pb xml:id="pg_157" n="157" facs="0182"/>internally was already in process of re-examining orders but had not yet consulted with other FonOffices concerned about possibility changes. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> declared himself content to have us report this to respective govts.</p>
<p>3. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> thinks most practicable place for a working party to deal with answer to Soviet note and other matters arising out of it would be Bonn.</p>
<p>Seydoux said this question should be put to <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s in Paris; I agreed. <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> strongly favors Bonn.</p>
<p>4. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> believes important at Paris meeting determine (a) what report should be made to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> re deliberations four <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s; (b) degree to which <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>s should consult on Berlin question. <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Seydoux</persName> suggested perhaps there should be two statements made after Paris meeting, one by the United States, United Kingdom and French Ministers, another by the four.</p>
<p>5. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said questions presented were in working paper form. He would welcome any questions our govts might have to ask, and would appreciate, if possible, having preliminary replies to his inquiries that might be discussed in Bonn before Paris meeting.</p>
<p>6. Having disposed of paper, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said Chancellor had been ill, but not seriously, yesterday from cold and fever contracted in Berlin,<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2"><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> visited Berlin December 4–6.</note>*** but was better today.</p>
<p>7. Additionally, he wished to ask one more question: should Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> come to Paris at time of meeting? I answered I had no instructions from my govt this regard, but expressed personal view this was affair to be settled between <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> Govt and <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>. It seemed to me inadvisable, indeed impossible, for him to be present in any capacity that could be construed as making him a fifth minister, but that I saw no personal objection to his going as a member of the German delegation and be available for expert advice. <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> associated himself with this view. <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Seydoux</persName> said he would consult his govt. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said he was most anxious have soonest possible any comments from our respective govts this connection. It was evident he attaches much importance to this point and strongly favors <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> going Paris. For many reasons it would be wise to have him there as member German delegation.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Thoughts on Berlin</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> probably has some flexibility in his position—he invited us through Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> to make counter-proposals, and it would in any case be very un-Russian of him not to begin a maneuver with maximum demands. But a number of signs indicate that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may be prepared to push his case to a really dangerous extreme, and therefore that his degree of flexibility is at present gravely short of any point to which contemplated proposals would reach from our side. We therefore seem to face a period in which risk of world war will rise to a very high point, perhaps higher than any so far.</p>
<p>The key question is, can we influence <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s flexibility sufficiently to bridge the dangerous gap between his position and ours, and if so how?</p>
<p>Essential components of such influence appear to be: getting <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to understand the Western position and the reasons for it more accurately, and showing him that we understand his problems better than he evidently thinks we do, and are prepared to deal with him on a frank and realistic basis with regard to problems on both sides.</p>
<p>Our basic estimate remains that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wants to pursue his aims without war. The inference is that he is crowding us on the Berlin issue partly because he does not fully grasp the importance of West Berlin to the West, and therefore does not believe that when the chips are down the West will go over the brink if necessary. For example, he spoke to <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> in terms of West Berlin’s military unimportance to us. He has evidently noted that we have recently been prepared to accept demilitarization of the offshore islands, and thinks we can reasonably accept an analogous solution for West Berlin.</p>
<p>The chief additional factor in his attitude seems to be his intense impatience with having West Berlin stuck inside the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> like a “bone in his throat”. This impatience probably derives from a number of sources—his temperament, the need to consolidate shaky spots in his empire, his feeling that the relative power position of the Bloc has grown <pb xml:id="pg_159" n="159" facs="0184"/>and that changes to reflect this fact in international relations are overdue, and the frustration of his efforts to obtain summit talks on his terms.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is by far the most “open” character yet to rule the USSR. Communication is more possible with him—on a thoroughly wary basis, of course. Moreover, he continues to show eager interest in communication—giving <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> eight hours of his time, for example, and again hinting that he would like to visit the U.S. Conversely, he reacts very negatively to indirect methods of persuasion or pressure, such as our summitry tactics or gestures of military threat—“Don’t threaten me,” he told <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName>.</p>
<p>The conclusion to be drawn is that by far our best chance of avoiding war through some kind of acceptable modus vivendi is frank, direct talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, by the President. Formal talks would hardly serve the purpose, and the effort to plan them would get bogged down in summitry anyway. The best device would be simply to invite <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> over to see America.</p>

Bonn’s 1204 to Department.<note n="1" xml:id="d90fn1">See <ref target="#d88fn1">footnote 1, Document 88</ref>.</note> In separate conversations today with two Foreign Office officials (both Department head level) both stated belief German paper (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>) omits most important question on which answers to all others depends, namely, “what do we do on May 27” (when six months expires).</p>
<p>One of Foreign Office officials went on to elaborate his thinking as follows: If this fundamental decision is not taken now situation likely to continue for remainder of six months in which both sides saying they do not want war and Western public, at least, assuming that therefore there <pb xml:id="pg_160" n="160" facs="0185"/>will not be war. He doubted if this was sound logic. He thought if fundamental decision is not taken in adequate time Soviets sure to know this fact and to be emboldened thereby. Moreover as time runs out existing enormous pressures not to take fundamental decision until last minute will be increased and last minute decisions as they are taken will create hasty reactions from other side greatly enhancing danger of chain reaction and slide into war without either side having expected or intended it. He defined fundamental question as two-fold (a) military—what do we do May 27 (or possibly sooner, depending on Soviet actions) and (b) political—what are likely consequences of failing to take fundamental decisions in adequate time. He thought if decision is not taken to go to war rather than allow Ger interference with access to Berlin (he did not go into distinction if any between issue of access and issue of “recognition”) and that decision made known to Soviets, all Western thinking and preparations will be on assumption war will not happen and risks of situation leading straight to war or Western climb down will be greatly increased. After first saying he did not see how Soviets could climb down without loss of face, he agreed they could ostensibly turn over responsibilities to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and then do nothing about it and leave all existing procedures unaltered.</p>
<p>The other Foreign Office official agreed about nature fundamental decision that must be taken but added that it included decision on what terms issue of war should be met, e.g., having embarked on negotiations or not.</p>
<p>One Foreign Office official thought <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> agreed that this fundamental decision must be taken first. The other expressed great pessimism and thought it would be impossible to get <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> to decide in December what it would do in May on so great and difficult an issue. He saw no sign that any serious thinking had taken place in any Western government on this issue.<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">Next to this sentence on the source text <persName corresp="#p_MJH1">McFarland</persName> wrote: “Only too true”.</note></p>

<dateline><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1958-12-09">December 9, 1958</date>.</dateline>
<p>Dear Mr. Secretary: The study drafted by the State-Defense ad hoc working group on Berlin<note n="1" xml:id="d91fn1">Not further identified. The ad hoc working group on Berlin continued to meet on December 1, 5, and 9 and generated at least 13 position papers, which were designated with the series indicator <gloss target="#t_BER1">BER</gloss>, including a preliminary draft of telegram 1236 (<ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>), and the aide-mémoire given to the British and French on December 11 (see <ref target="#d98fn5">footnote 5, Document 98</ref>). Scattered records of the group are in Department of State, <gloss target="#t_EURSOV1">EUR/SOV</gloss> Files: Lot 64 D 291, Germany.</note> has been reviewed by the Department of Defense in the light of the Soviet note of 27 November 1958. Although the announced Soviet “half year” delay in withdrawing from quadripartite obligations in Berlin presents new considerations, it does not preclude the Soviets from initiating the necessary steps in a surprise move at almost any time they wish to establish a pretext. Accordingly, the Department of Defense considers that positive action on the Berlin situation should be taken without delay in the following respects:</p>
<list>
<item>a. The United States should recommend to the U.K. and France the immediate revision of tripartite contingency plans for travel to and from Berlin to eliminate all dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials at highway and railway checkpoints.</item>
<item>b. The United States should instruct its official personnel traveling to and from Berlin not to accept control of their movements by East German personnel acting in functions previously performed by Soviet personnel. If any such attempts at control occur, U.S. personnel should return to point of departure.</item>
<item>c. Presidential approval should be obtained which will authorize action to test <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Soviet intentions and force the issue promptly by dispatching a convoy supported by appropriate force, if and when the checkpoints are turned over completely to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control.</item>
<item>d. As part of an early note to the USSR Government, preferably without public announcement, and with British, French and West German agreement, the Soviet Government should be informed simultaneously by the Western Allies that we do not intend to deal with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in those functions involving the quadripartite occupation obligations of the USSR, that we will not allow the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to impede the exercise of any right we presently hold, that we will not accept any control by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> over our movements to and from Berlin, and that we will use force if necessary to enforce our rights.</item>
</list>
<p>The Department of Defense recognizes the possibility that the military garrisons in Berlin may have to be supplied by air in the event that it is not possible to maintain access over surface routes. However, the <pb xml:id="pg_162" n="162" facs="0187"/>Department of Defense considers that this method of resupply should be undertaken only as a last resort, after all efforts to open ground access have failed. It is understood that contingency planning on the maintenance of access to Berlin through the air corridors and for air supply of military garrisons in Berlin is currently in progress in Europe.</p>
<p>Lastly, let me say that the Department of Defense is hopeful that the U.S. can early seize the initiative in the present situation. While we have supported the view that a four-power conference should be proposed at an early date on the entire German question, it is recognized that this is primarily a political matter and that you have alternative proposals under intensive study in the Department of State.</p>
<p>It is requested that the Department of Defense be advised of your reaction to the recommendations listed above.<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">On December 19 Acting Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName>’ letter had been overtaken by events (see <ref target="#d97">Documents 97</ref> and <ref target="#d98">98</ref>), but that the Department of State agreed with him that the United States should seize the diplomatic initiative in its reply to the Soviet note.

<p>1247. I believe <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s long conversation with <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> on Berlin question indicates realization on his part of dangers involved and concern over outcome. He and other Presidium members have shown great interest in Western reaction and among others have questioned my Swedish, Austrian and Indian colleagues. While it is clear that neither <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> nor Soviet Government as a whole wishes to run real risk of war, they will be very reluctant to back down if issue is posed in <pb xml:id="pg_163" n="163" facs="0188"/>such a way as to involve great loss of prestige for Soviet Union. If in such circumstances we should use force to maintain access to Berlin they are capable, in my judgment, of allowing East Germans to respond with force. It therefore seems important that in handling the situation we leave open some way for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to retreat and save face.</p>
<p>Difficulty of devising any counter proposals on Berlin are obvious but would appear to me there are elements for a bargain which would leave neither side materially worse off and which Soviets might be brought to accept if West is firmly united in opposition to current Soviet proposals and prepared in last resort to use force. As to concessions on our part there is a wide range of possibilities running from radical to relatively minor window dressing actions. For example, we could consider such actions as 1) withdrawal our troops and their substitution by West German forces and incorporation of West Berlin into West Germany; 2) some steps toward de facto recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>; 3) turning over full responsibility for administration West Berlin to Germans, although keeping our troops there; 4) termination of overt Western activities in Berlin such as operation radio station, etc.</p>
<p>As against concessions of this nature principal concession from Soviet side would presumably be related to problem of access. We might obtain recognition right of commercial air access, some type of corridor under West German control, etc. It might also be possible to devise scheme involving creation free city including East Berlin. This does not, however, appear to me to be profitable line of approach since Soviets unlikely make concession on this point and at same time agree to satisfactory arrangements to ensure access.</p>
<p>I do not believe Soviet action on Berlin was designed to lead to discussion of German problem as a whole nor do I believe they would formally agree to a meeting for this purpose. Nevertheless I think that at a meeting on the Berlin question it might be possible to draw them into such a discussion particularly if approached from the point of view of European security.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 1631. We have been discussing with Embassy, US Element <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>, and among ourselves possible formulations of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> position concerning Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Ray Thurston</persName> has come up with following brief formulation which strikes us as excellent, and could possibly serve as core of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué on this subject:</p>
<list><item>“The Western position in Berlin is not only a symbol but also a concrete assurance that the West will persist in its efforts to obtain a peaceful and just settlement of the entire German question.

<p>We think a formulation of this kind could be a standard to which all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries could repair while discussions continue on desirability of one kind or another of initiative on German problem.

<p>Dear Livie: I have your letter of the 8th<note n="1" xml:id="d94fn1">Not found in Department of State files.</note> and naturally I am distressed to learn that the Secretary is ill. I understand that he is going to <pb xml:id="pg_165" n="165" facs="0190"/>the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting in any event and certainly I would be only too happy to do anything I could to give guidance to the Secretary in regard to the very difficult problem of Berlin.</p>
<p>On receipt of your letter I got in touch with General <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName> and Jim Conant, both of whom had received similar inquiries, as you know. I talked to <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Lucius Clay</persName> last night and then again to Jim Conant this morning. Jim, I believe, is sending you a separate statement<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2"><ref target="#d95">Document 95</ref>.</note> of his views and I will attempt to set out General <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName>’s and mine herewith.</p>
<p>We all recognize how difficult it is to give any helpful advice on the situation when we are so far removed from all communications and the general play of forces which now are centering about the problems of Berlin. In the abstract, however, we probably can state some principles while [<hi rend="italic">which?</hi>], if they are not helpful, at least represent some of our thinking.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName>’s ideas run something along this line. In the first place we should make up our minds whether or not we are prepared to make any interference with our access to Berlin, including civilian traffic as well as our military, a casus belli. Not only must we make this determination, but we have to state it clearly and at the outset so that the Russians and the world understand it. This is a sine qua non of any attempt to negotiate a satisfactory solution to the Berlin problem. <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName> feels very strongly that the Russians will not go to war over Berlin but unless it is made clear that we would, there is no base from which we can negotiate. If this is not our position, he could see no satisfactory intermediate ground we could hold.</p>
<p>Secondly, after the foregoing was made clear he would very shortly take some steps which would be preliminary to the incorporation of West Berlin into the West German State. He has felt it was an error not to have done this long ago. He is aware that there were objections on the part of West Germans themselves in the past, but he feels they were largely political in nature and that they should now be cast aside in view of the emergency and the heavy stakes Germany and Europe have in Berlin’s future. This incorporation could be undertaken under a gradual but none the less definite program. He would be disposed at a given time to reduce our garrisons to one-half of their present size and that half replenished with West German troops. He would not make any reference, of course, in the pending communication to the Russians of our willingness to negotiate with the East Germans, but he does feel that in the long run we should urge the West Germans to accept a program of negotiations for unification of all Germany with the East Germans. He said we should emphasize the fact that West Berlin has precisely the <pb xml:id="pg_166" n="166" facs="0191"/>same status as West Germany so far as our rights are concerned. What rights we had there came from conquest and they cannot be impaired. We pulled out of Saxony and they moved in, and they pulled out of West Berlin and we moved in. Since the rights came from the same source, West Berlin must be defended in precisely the same manner in which we would defend West Germany. The incorporation of the city into the West German Republic would, of course, automatically incorporate West Berlin into the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense system.</p>
<p>At a certain point, <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName> feels that it is more a matter of semantics than reality for the West Germans to refuse to deal with the East Germans, although no indication at this time should be given that we would countenance this. West Germany is already dealing with the East Germans on a low level de facto basis and he is inclined to feel that in dealing with East German Communists there may be advantages to be gained through them rather than the Russians.</p>
<p>As for my own views, I am clear that we should give a resounding “no” to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s proposals. We should make clear the history which led up to our arrangements in respect to West Germany and Berlin, pointing out the gross distortions of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s account, bearing down again on the fact of the German-Russian alliance which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> ignores in his survey of past history. I would also emphasize that we exchanged a very large part of East Germany for the part we occupy in Berlin. This last point is very strong, I think. We have a right to ask them to withdraw from that part of East Germany which we occupied if they are asking us to withdraw from Berlin.</p>
<p>I am clear that we should give no indication that we would be prepared to deal with the East German puppet regime. I would be in favor of stating that we are quite prepared to deal with East Germans who are freely elected as representatives to deal with the West Germans. I know the Russians would not accept this but it strikes a note always worth repeating. We should write <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that we agree the Germans should now be given the opportunity of determining their own destiny and immediately the future status of Berlin, but this cannot be an imposed will on the part of the Germans, but their own freely expressed one. “We are prepared to chance it, why aren’t you?”</p>
<p>I would certainly wish to make it clear to the Russians and to the world that we would consider it an act of aggression if any attempt were made to constrict in any way the present access of civilians and the military to Berlin and I would make it clear that we would be compelled to use force to remove any obstacles to our free access to the city. I think I would not talk about going to war, even though this may be involved. We must have public opinion on our side both in Europe and here. I do not think <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName> would disagree with this. The important thing is that we make it clear that we must use force if the blockade is reimposed. Both <pb xml:id="pg_167" n="167" facs="0192"/><persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName> and I feel, and I believe Jim agrees, that the reinstatement of the air lift would be a defeat for us and an act of appeasement rather than an act of defiance.</p>
<p>I am not clear in my mind about the wisdom of incorporating West Berlin into West Germany. I do believe the matter should be carefully studied and thought out. It has some advantages but I believe it may have some disadvantages as well. Conant, I believe, feels that such incorporation might destroy our access throughout the entire city of Berlin that we made such an effort to maintain. Without giving consideration to all its implications, my instinct would be to agree that <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName>’s proposal has merit.</p>
<p>I think that another effort should be made to pressure the Chancellor and the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> into a unified position on Berlin. It is most unfortunate that there is a division in West Germany and apparently between the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> in West Germany and <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Willy Brandt</persName> in Berlin. [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] I think if the Secretary really put the pressure on for a unified attitude in Germany, it would make our situation a whole lot better. It is very difficult to be critical of the lack of unity among the Allies if there is a lack of it in Germany. If any situation needed a bipartisan foreign policy, this one does.</p>
<p>One thing is perfectly clear. However reasonable and rational a solution may appear, if it does not at the same time appear that we have taken a strong position vis-à-vis Berlin and have solidly maintained it, the merit of the particular solution will be lost in the over-all effect that would follow from any impression of weakness or appeasement.</p>
<p>I think <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName> feels, as I have already pointed out, that at some time we ought to be prepared to face a negotiated settlement between the East Germans and the West Germans on unification. I am clear that this could not be done on a “de facto” basis on as crucial an issue as this or as crucial an issue as the future status of Berlin. This would be real recognition and it ought to be faced as such.</p>
<p>It may be going rather far afield to bring up another point <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName> and I talked about last night, but on a number of occasions now <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has indicated a desire to trade with the United States. <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> just brought back another statement of his in this regard. Perhaps as a means of bargaining it might be well at this time to give an indication to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that we are prepared to sit down and talk to him about trade, provided we have a satisfactory settlement in regard to Berlin.</p>
<p>There may have been a time when the restrictions on trade had a good bit to do with what we thought was our security position, but I believe everyone agrees that the Russians have a sufficient stockpile of nuclear weapons and other military equipment to damage us about as heavily as we could damage them, so what is the use of now blocking <pb xml:id="pg_168" n="168" facs="0193"/>trade. It is a strong argument that it would not be of any effect in any event. There is also an argument that to open up trade with them would accelerate their economic development and increase their standard of living more rapidly, and this would be used as a great propaganda factor in their attempt to gain the favor of other underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p>Both <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName> and I think that the increase in the Russian industrial potential is sufficiently spectacular as it is in regard to the impression on underdeveloped countries and a very good argument can be made that the higher the standard of living is increased, the more likely the Russians are to prefer a condition of peace in order to enjoy it. We do think that the whole economic and military effect of embargo as an effective weapon in the present state of the world needs to be substantially reexamined. We know this would raise great political discussions in this country, but I am not sure that you would not find very substantial public opinion in favor of trade relations, it now having been made so clear that the embargo would not interfere with Russia’s being able to amass a massive and modern military machine.</p>
<p>These are rather random thoughts and we have not had a chance to polish them up in view of the shortness of time available. Please convey to the Secretary our wishes for his rapid recovery and a very successful meeting, and also our profound admiration for his stamina. He went to Quemoy and Matsu<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> visited Taiwan October 20–23.</note> and came home with the bacon, and we are not at all sure that this may not be an easier job that he has to face now. He certainly has public opinion more solidly behind him over the Berlin issue than anything in regard to the Formosa Straits.</p>

<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName>: I have just received a letter from <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Livie Merchant</persName> in which he stated that you would like to have me write you at once about <pb xml:id="pg_169" n="169" facs="0194"/>the Berlin situation.<note n="1" xml:id="d95fn1">Not found in Department of State files.</note> I appreciate the invitation and am happy to give you my views for what they may be worth. Needless to say, the premises of my thinking reflect my experiences of two years ago. I am, of course, not up-to-date on any developments of a confidential nature.</p>
<p>I assume that the position which is finally reached would be a joint U.S.-British-French-German position. I wish that the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> leaders in Germany might be brought into the picture in some way. I suggest that the Chancellor be urged to have another talk with <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ollenhauer</persName> to see if some approach to a bipartisan foreign policy could be made. Perhaps you or one of the other Foreign Ministers might see <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ollenhauer</persName> together with the Chancellor if the latter would agree.</p>
<p>I am still firmly of the opinion that no negotiation of any sort should be opened with the German Democratic Republic. And I hope the first public statement of the Western position will make it plain that we will use force if necessary to insure that West Berlin remains under the control of the present freely elected government, and that likewise we will use force if necessary to insure that the city is supplied <hi rend="italic">as at present.</hi> In private communication to the Soviets, I would suggest spelling out in detail what this statement means. I would favor stating that the day <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> carries out his threat and declares that his government has no further responsibility in the Zone or in Berlin, we would be prepared to occupy with our troops as much of his Zone as would be necessary to insure free passage of goods to Berlin by rail and autobahn. We would consider that his abdication of authority over the East Germans leaves us no choice but to exert our authority of [<hi rend="italic">over</hi>] as much of Germany as is necessary for us to fulfill our commitment to free Berlin.</p>
<p>If it comes to a showdown the first step the East regime will probably take would involve interfering with the flow of supplies to the civilian population. (In a sense they did take this step when they raised the autobahn tolls in 1955.) I do not imagine that we would take aggressive military action against the Soviet troops in retaliation for the East German soldiers stopping civilian trucks. But, I believe it would be proper for us to react at once to such stoppage (after <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has declared the Soviet’s authority is at an end) by a disposal of our troops to insure communication between the Federal Republic and free Berlin. The East Germans would have to be the first to shoot under the conditions. I doubt if they would, and if they did public opinion in the U.S. and in the free world would be on our side.</p>
<p>If the East regime did not stop all traffic but only annoyed us by intermittent stoppages because of broken rails and bridges, I think the West Germans should reply by embargoing all exports to the Soviet <pb xml:id="pg_170" n="170" facs="0195"/>Zone. Such action was discussed in 1955, and I was then convinced that in an economic battle we had better weapons than the East. The Federal Republic did not agree as they were worried about the supply of brown coal. The possibility of an economic offensive against the East Germans might well be reexamined.</p>
<p>Finally, I venture to suggest a possible new twist to our policy on reunification. I have in mind the possible need of meeting the British Labor Party’s demand for a “new look” at this issue. I should be against any attempt to bring together representatives of the Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic. As a counter-proposal with propaganda value, we might offer to try and arrange elections in each of the states in the Federal Republic if the Soviets would do the same in the six states of their Zone. The voters would choose representatives to meet in an all-German council, which would have no administrative powers but which would be concerned solely with exploring a basis for reunification. Neither the Federal Republic nor the Democratic Republic would be represented on the council. I should not insist on supervised elections. Of course, the result would be six Communist members of the council, but since the council would be only for purposes of talk, this would not be dangerous.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">In a note attached to the source text and dated December 22, Leon Fuller and <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">George Morgan</persName> of the Policy Planning Staff noted that this suggestion was interesting and might have some value as a gimmick in dealing with the Soviet Union.</note></p>
<p>I suppose the Russians would reject the offer, but our having made it might be a good move particularly with reference to the attitude of the British Labor Party. (Gaitskell and I debated German reunification in an issue of <hi rend="italic">Western World</hi> last Spring.)<note n="3" xml:id="d95fn3">For texts of Conant’s “Against the Neutralization of a United Germany” and Gaitskell’s “Such a Policy Might Pay,” see <hi rend="italic">Western World,</hi> Spring 1958, pp. 36–44.</note> If the Russians were to accept the proposal, clearly the Berlin situation would be frozen in the present status until this all-German council could meet and proceed with their deliberations. These deliberations might take forever. Yet such a delaying action, it seems to me, is on our side.</p>
<p>I have no idea whether the Chancellor or the opposition leaders would consider such a proposal of any value. Of course, it could not be put forward unless there were agreement at least with the Chancellor. But if the idea seemed to have merit to the West, it might be pushed vigorously with the Germans, as I am afraid the Chancellor’s first reactions to any new ideas of this sort are apt to be over-conservative. It might be pointed out to him that this action would be by the four occupying powers and would simply be used as a mechanism for getting together representatives from separate German states for a preliminary negotiation, looking forward to a proposal for an all-German government.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_171" n="171" facs="0196"/>
<p>I hardly need say that I realize that many, if not all, of my ideas may be of no value because of conditions which are unknown to me. Thank you for the opportunity of replying.</p>

<p>Fought as usual today for firmness in Berlin. I see no way for the U.S. Government to avoid a decision, to be made known privately to the Soviets, that we are ready to preserve our rights in Berlin by force. This means an ultimate recourse to war, not waged in Berlin but between the US and the USSR. It would be difficult to persuade our allies to adopt such a course, but unless we have the firm intention, if driven to it, to employ force no matter what the risks, we will never in my opinion reach a satisfactory arrangement with the Soviet Government. However we should decide, there should be no publicity or use of threats, but our stand should be conveyed privately to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> so that at least he would make no miscalculations.<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">The following day <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> attended <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trimble</persName>’s staff meeting and reiterated these views.

<p>The President called this meeting as the result of learning that the contingency plans currently in effect covering a possible closing of the corridors to Berlin are not adequate. He began the meeting by announcing that we are here to consider the attitude that we will take in the face of the current Berlin situation.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> presented the basic State Department position by stating that we have now discovered that our initial position (that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> may be considered as agents of the Soviets) no longer applies. This conclusion he has reached because of: (a) the Soviet note of November twenty-seventh, which was received after the formulation of the U.S. position, and (b) the violence of the reaction of Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. Thus, since we do not recognize the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as agents of the Soviets, if <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials attempt to stamp or examine our papers, the question is what do we do?</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> went on to explain that the draft message under consideration, which is designed for transmittal to the U.S. Embassy in Bonn,<note n="1" xml:id="d97fn1">State Dept. Telegram Amembassy Bonn <gloss target="#t_Niact1">Niact</gloss> 1236. [Footnote in the source text; telegram 1236 is printed as <ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>.]</note> is to be used as a paper for tabling at an Ambassadorial level talk to our allies in Bonn.</p>
<p>This contingency plan message, and the four-power discussions with relation to it, should not be confused with the four-power discussions <pb xml:id="pg_173" n="173" facs="0198"/>which are soon to take place at the Ministerial level during the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting in Paris. This Ministerial level meeting is designed to formulate an official answer to the Soviet note of November twenty-seventh. It had been recommended that this matter be considered in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> rather than in Bonn because of the rigid attitude of the British Ambassador in Bonn. The decision had emanated from the recommendation of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> in Bonn.</p>
<p>The President agreed that this message would be all right for discussion purposes with our allies. He then went on to explain some of the difficulties which he visualizes. First of all, the U.S. now finds itself in a different situation from that in which the present agreements were formulated. These agreements came about at a time when all four powers were occupiers, which we no longer are. In the President’s view, the U.S. made an error in attempting to control Germany from Berlin, so far behind the Russian lines. But he also recognizes that we now have pledges in the form of two million Germans in West Berlin, and we must stay there for their protection if nothing else. Since the present agreements were formulated, we have recognized West Germany and the Soviets have recognized East Germany. Since we refuse to recognize East Germany, our position with respect to Berlin can best be described as a “can of worms.”</p>
<p>The President then referred to a conversation which he had recently with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">Not further identified although it might be that recorded in <ref target="#d80">Document 80</ref>.</note> At this time the two had agreed that negotiation with the Chinese Communists and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to leave our prisoners in their hands has not in itself resulted in recognition. The problem is, where do we go from here? We are in a position of using an obsolete agreement with a former occupying power as a basis on which to force our way into Berlin. In conclusion, the President stated that this paper is acceptable to table for discussion purposes with our allies, with recognition of the magnitude of the problem facing us.</p>
<p>The President then turned to another aspect of the problem, to wit, the definition of the term “token force.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> suggested that the key to the “token force” idea is to avoid letting the situation slip to the point that the force must become a major invasion. Our position must be to meet the first indications resolutely.</p>
<p>The President, in general agreement with this idea, questioned whether we shouldn’t make it clear to the Russians that we consider this no minor affair. In order to avoid beginning with the white chips and working up to the blue, we should place them on notice that our whole stack is in this play.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_174" n="174" facs="0199"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then shifted the conversation to a British paper received the other day (State Department Daily Summary, December 11)<note n="3" xml:id="d97fn3">A copy of the Daily Summary is in Department of State, Executive Secretariat Files: Lot 64 D 187. Copies of the British paper on Soviet intentions in Berlin, dated December 10, were transmitted as enclosures to despatch 1432 from London, December 18. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files 762.00/12–1858)</note> in which the focus was thrown on the issue of interference with our rights of access, and the matter of recognition downgraded. On this matter, the President stated that in some of the reports he had seen, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> has complicated the issue by taking a softer attitude toward the prospect of a free city (including all zones) than does <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. On this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, seconded by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, stated that <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> has made one statement to that effect but that his position is not quite clear.</p>
<p>The President then gave a review of the actual events that transpired in 1945 with regard to selection of Berlin as a site from which to govern Germany. (He referred to the press conference of December 10.)<note n="4" xml:id="d97fn4">For a record of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s press conference on December 10, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>, 1958,</hi> pp. 851–860.</note> He stated that he had been in favor of a cantonment type of combined headquarters located at the juncture of the zones. In contrast to this situation, we are now confronted with a group of hostages in the hands of the Soviets.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then mentioned the problem of timing of a reply to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The French are in no hurry to reply to the Soviet note. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> considers that how we approach the USSR on this matter is most important. On this, the President stated that we must give a reply after the Ministerial meeting of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. This reply should specify that we stand to guarantee the safety of West Germany.</p>
<p>Here Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> is preparing a communiqué similar to that issued after the Berlin airlift in 1948.</p>
<p>The President now questioned the State Department as to their views on the efficacy of token force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>’s answer to this was that the key issue is a willingness to use limited force to maintain our rights. The attitude of the Germans if we let the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials stamp our papers would be bad. If we accept any signs of jurisdiction by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in the first instance, we have no firm line on which to stand if later provocations follow. He repeated that we must use limited force at the first instance, and that will be the greatest deterrent.</p>
<p>General Taylor proceeded to outline the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to wit, that it is difficult to tell how far we will go ultimately in our use of force. The important thing, in the view of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, is to verify that we have been stopped, not by our own backing down, but by actual use of force on the part of the Soviets. From there we may have to proceed <pb xml:id="pg_175" n="175" facs="0200"/>to an airlift as the next step; but this is the least desirable course of action and is regarded as a form of defeat. In short, an attempt on the part of an armed convoy may be regarded as a “reconnaissance in force.” Its failure would leave us facing two choices: the use of more force, or the use of an airlift.</p>
<p>The Vice President then posed the question of what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is after. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> considers it improbable that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is seeking a fight but believes that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may be seeking a conference.</p>
<p>On this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> ventured that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is probably looking for a way out at this time. His first motive had been to point up Europe since things in the world had been going rather well for the U.S. (Lebanon and Quemoy).</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> pointed out the parallel between this situation and the Quemoy situation in that the Soviets had stirred up trouble as a device to lure us into a conference. He then asked if the U.S. is willing at this time to have a conference.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, still referring to the question of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s motives, stated the view that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had felt a need to bolster East Germany. Many people were making their escape from East Germany through Berlin. A high percentage of these people comprised intellectuals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, stating that if a free election were held in East Germany, only 10% would vote Communist.</p>
<p>The President referred back to the joint message to be formulated at Paris as an answer to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. In this message, the President feels we should use a tone which establishes that we are not seeking war and that we realize that the USSR is likewise not seeking war. This message should, after establishing our peaceful intentions, proceed to say that, “When you deny us our rights then we must reassess the situation.” This message should be sent by the U.S. and our associates should send parallel messages. These messages should be sent soon after the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. Once again the President reiterated that the messages should be in a friendly tone. To these thoughts, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> added a final view that the theme of the messages should emphasize the regrettability of unilateral repudiation of obligation on the part of the USSR.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> now brought up a new problem: the orders which are currently in effect directing personnel in the field to deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials as agents of the USSR. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> feels that this must change. General Taylor agreed, pointing out that the orders are the result of Ambassadorial agreements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> added they had been in effect since 1954.</p>
<p>This fact came somewhat as a surprise to the President, who stated that he believed he detected a correlation between this fact and the actions of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. In the President’s view, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has probably <pb xml:id="pg_176" n="176" facs="0201"/>been counting on this to be our policy. He directed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> to get the message off immediately to the Ambassador at Bonn to initiate Ambassadorial meetings with a view to revision of these instructions.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> now brought up the question of immediate action in the event of interference with convoys. Primarily, the question is one of timing. In the event a convoy is held up, do we pull back and consider the next move or is a limited use of force automatic? (The President observed that every convoy in a way is a probe.)</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> continued with the thesis that our major problem is how to make the USSR use force first. Obviously, interference with airlift requires the USSR to be the first to use force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> questioned whether our policy in this regard has changed. General Taylor specified one point: when a ground convoy is stopped it does not remain at the detention point but departs the scene. In this connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed up the weakness of railroad traffic, which is that the Communists can blow a bridge and interdict the railroad without the direct use of force. General Taylor again reiterated his former point that he dislikes to retreat to the use of airlift.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> now brought up the subject of a tack to be used in our approach to the Soviets. He feels that we should emphasize the rights of the two million people of West Berlin rather than the military rights of the occupying powers. To this the President agreed, specifying that a proper vehicle for emphasizing this point would be the talk which the Secretary of State might make when he leaves the hospital.<note n="5" xml:id="d97fn5"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was in Walter Reed Hospital December 5–12 for various tests.</note></p>
<p>In regard to the text of a reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> expressed the view that we must reject the Soviet unilateral action and propose a talk on the status of all Germany. The President interposed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had refused to consider a talk on all Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> recommended that we not accept this stand of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s. As to timing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> agreed that we should have a draft completed after the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting. However, he pointed out that the British will oppose the principle of use of limited force.</p>
<p>In view of possible difficulties with the British, the President then directed that we get our views in front of the British right now to allow them maximum time for consideration. In particular, if our policy is to be that our tack is to force the East Germans to use force, this point should be established early. However, the President specified that our main task should be to reach <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, ascertain what he wants, and proceed from there.</p>
<p>As a finale to the meeting, the President illustrated the complexity of these questions by describing a recent meeting he had had with a lady <pb xml:id="pg_177" n="177" facs="0202"/>(Queen Frederika).<note n="6" xml:id="d97fn6">President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had lunch with Queen Frederika of Greece on October 23 during her visit to the United States.</note> She had urged that he take steps to ease world tensions by making a generous offer to the Soviets, so generous that the Soviets and the world would recognize it as such—but it must be short of surrender. This, the President stated, would be the trick of the week.<note n="7" xml:id="d97fn7">According to another record of this conference drafted by Executive Secretary Lay, <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName>, Taylor, <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GBGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>, Major <persName corresp="#p_EMJSD1">Eisenhower</persName>, Lay, and the President met in the Cabinet Room immediately after this conference in the President’s office, but at Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s urging no record was kept of their conversation.

Rationale no longer convincing in light position taken by Soviets in their note of November 27. Agency theory, which at best could only have provided interim solution, breaks down when both principal (USSR) and “agent” (<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) deny such relationship and Soviet Union simply attempting to abandon its responsibilities.</p>
<p>By unilateral withdrawal from position as Occupying Power, USSR will create vacuum in Occupation arrangements. If no interference with our right of access, there no problem. However, in light present practice (in which <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> already controls West German traffic) and announced intentions, harassment may be expected but, at least initially, probably would not involve total blockade as in 1948–49 but could be limited to Allied traffic only. If there is actual or threatened harassment or interference would appear general principles applicable to joint operations would apply. When one party drops out, remaining parties entitled fill vacuum at least to extent necessary protect their rights. Under these circumstances, 3 Powers justified assert their rights take over control Autobahn and railroad and control air traffic between Federal Republic and Berlin to extent necessary ensure their unrestricted access Berlin.</p>
<p>In no event would <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> become beneficiary of attempted relinquishment by USSR of its rights and obligations or attempted voiding by USSR of Occupation rights of Western Powers in Berlin, without consent Western Powers. Further, latter cannot be divested of right as Occupying Powers without their consent, which presumably would be given only in connection with final settlement in form peace treaty.</p>
<p>In 1954, when agency theory considered feasible, it was assumed Soviets would only partially and gradually relinquish their controls. If consistent in asserting agency relationship did exist between <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and USSR, we should have no basis refusing deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> on any other matter involving Soviet responsibility in Germany.</p>
<p>Evident Berlin (Bonn’s 1161), Soviet Zone and Federal Republic populace regard any dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> checkpoint officials as first step, however tentative, toward recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> regime. Federal Republic and Berlin officials would inevitably draw conclusions from such action highly unfavorable to present Allied position on German question and Allied-German relationships. Far greater difficulty likely in mobilizing public opinion for firm stand at some later stage when already part way down “slippery slope” than at moment first <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials appear at checkpoints. Finally, recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> by Allies would make Allied access to Berlin more vulnerable with end result our position would become untenable.</p>
<p>Embassy Bonn should raise urgently with British and French reconsideration existing contingency plans with view to eliminating all proposals for dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials at Autobahn and railway <pb xml:id="pg_179" n="179" facs="0204"/>checkpoints. After tripartite agreement reached Germans should be fully informed of details.</p>
<p>In place of present plans approved U.S. course of action should be presented to British and French, as follows:</p>
<p>A. Three Ambassadors in Moscow should inform Soviet Government at appropriate time (1) that 3 Powers continue hold USSR fully responsible under quadripartite agreements and arrangements concerning Berlin; (2) that 3 Powers have noted Soviet statements to effect that USSR will withdraw from its remaining Occupation functions with respect to Berlin. That they assume this means Soviets intend withdraw Soviet personnel from interzonal Autobahn and railway checkpoints and from <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>; (3) that 3 Powers’ right unrestricted access would remain unaffected by Soviet withdrawal; (4) that 3 Powers will not tolerate attempt on part of so-called <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to assert any control over or to interfere with their traffic to and from Berlin via quadripartitely established routes, and would take all measures necessary to protect their rights in this connection; (5) that, if Soviets withdraw, Western Powers will act on assumption (a) that USSR has decided to abolish unnecessary administrative procedures at interzonal borders, and (b) that USSR can and will, without benefit of exchange of flight information in <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>, maintain absolute separation of Soviet aircraft and all other aircraft flying in Soviet Zone from aircraft of 3 Powers flying in Berlin corridors and control zone; (6) that Western Powers will expect their traffic to move freely without any presentation of documents or other formalities at interzonal borders and will assume Soviets have given blanket assurance of safety of all 3 Power aircraft in Berlin corridors and control zone.</p>
<p>B. That if Soviet personnel are then withdrawn from checkpoints, we continue to dispatch military trains and military motor convoys on normal schedule and that we instruct commanders as indicated in para C below to refuse present any documentation to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> checkpoint control officials or comply with any formalities suggested or instructions given by latter.</p>
<p>C. If <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> checkpoint personnel refuse to permit passage our trains and convoys on this basis, procedure in Berlin’s 422 and <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss>’s <gloss target="#t_SX1">SX</gloss> 7922 would apply at once.</p>
<p>D. At this stage and before considering resort to airlift, attempt to reopen access through use limited military force will be made in order demonstrate our determination maintain surface access. In any case, Soviets and East Germans should not be allowed entertain doubts as to our determination to do so if need be. Even if force not resorted to at once we should continue assert our rights to resume interrupted traffic and our intention to do so by force if necessary. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Purpose of resort to limited force proposed above, is, beyond that stated, to test Soviet intentions. If <pb xml:id="pg_180" n="180" facs="0205"/>British and French refuse to consider the limited use of force, matter will be referred to Washington for consideration of possible unilateral action in light of the circumstances prevailing at the time. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
<p>E. As concomitant to above course of action, we should consider whether 3 Powers should not take some additional step to guarantee their unrestricted air access to Berlin, which would be essential to maintaining status and security of city. Three Powers might, for example, reformulate and restate their Berlin guarantee, modifying it to add that they will regard any interference with their right and practice of unrestricted access to Berlin by air, including operation of their civil air carriers, as attack upon their forces and upon themselves. Here issue of flight in corridors over 10,000 feet might be solved by simple Three Power agreement to fly at altitude appropriate to efficient operation of individual aircraft. Communist harassment of our air access, which would be possible only through patent application of force, would be clear evidence of provocative intent. If it occurred we could then take such military/political/economic counteraction as necessary to maintain Berlin with fair assurance such action would have support of American, French, British and German public opinion.<note n="5" xml:id="d98fn5">Later on December 11 <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> handed representatives of the British and French Embassies identic aides-mémoire reflecting the position taken in this telegram.

<dateline><placeName>Bonn</placeName>, <date when="1958-12-11">December 11, 1958</date>.</dateline>
<p>Mr. Secretary, Dear Friend: I have just heard with pleasure that you have already gotten over your illness and will be able to participate in the meeting of foreign ministers and the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultations. Your presence at these meetings will be very reassuring to me.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_181" n="181" facs="0206"/>
<p>Since I am convinced that the consultations among the foreign ministers in Paris will be of decisive importance for Europe and the future of the Atlantic Alliance, I consider it advisable to acquaint you with my thoughts on this first phase of our policy. As you know, I recently spent a few days in Berlin.<note n="1" xml:id="d99fn1"><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> visited Berlin December 4–6.</note> It was reassuring for me to note that neither the population of Berlin, nor the City’s Senate are showing any signs of nervousness or weakness, and that there is unanimity between Berlin and the Federal Republic in all foreign policy questions. In the meantime, there has been an election in Berlin.<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">December 7.</note> The result of this election is clear proof of this firm attitude towards the leaders of the so-called <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the Soviet Union. In comparison with the 1954 elections, the communist <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> lost almost half of its votes. It received only 1.9% of the votes. This shows that the population of Berlin is determined to resist any Soviet threat. I am sure that this attitude of the Berlin population will not change even if the crisis should become worse, as long as the Western Powers unconditionally stand by their guarantee of the freedom of the Western part of the city, and the Federal Republic and the United States continue their economic support of the city. But I am equally sure that any hesitation or vacillation by the three guarantor powers must result in grave concern—if not panic—in Berlin. Since the 1948 blockade, the situation of Berlin has changed fundamentally. Due to American aid and the constant support by the Federal Republic, the city’s economy is flourishing considerably, and while in 1948 the citizens of Berlin were more or less all equally poor, there are now large parts of the population that have something to lose once more, and have to fear for their hard-earned property and their personal liberty. What is more, the population is now much more alert, and it is clear to any thinking person that an airlift would not nearly be able to maintain the present standard of living of West Berlin. Finally, at the time of the blockade, no one was able to leave Berlin anyway, while now anyone can. I believe that it is of decisive importance for the development of West Berlin and the Federal Republic, to which any disturbance or panic in Berlin would spread, as well as Western Europe and the Free World, that not the least doubt should arise as to the guarantor powers and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> standing by their commitments even in the most serious contingency.</p>
<p>If everything goes as planned, the consultations of the foreign ministers on Berlin will be relatively short. It is therefore very important that the communiqué be very clear and unambiguous, because the attention of the world will be focused on the wording of the communiqué. I have just explained what the effect of somewhat unclear and ambiguous formulations <pb xml:id="pg_182" n="182" facs="0207"/>would be on Berlin. Moreover, I believe that if the Soviets found even a small indication in the communiqué that we might be disposed to consider a limitation of the rights of the three Western Powers in Berlin, a genuine danger to world peace could arise from this misconception.</p>
<p>As you know, I share your oft-expressed and confirmed opinion that any retreat before the use of force and infringement of our rights by the Soviet Union would have incalculable consequences for the future of the free West. I also believe that among all the efforts of the Kremlin to undermine the unity of the West, the case of Berlin is the most dangerous. Even a partial Russian success, by striking a blow at the confidence in contractual agreements and commitments undertaken, which is the necessary basis of this unity, would shake the entire carefully built-up structure of Western unity vis-à-vis communism.</p>
<p>In recent days, there have been public debates in almost all countries on whether it would be a good idea to answer the Soviet threat to the freedom of Berlin with an offer to the Soviet government to discuss the German problem as a whole. There is no doubt that such a discussion is necessary, at the right time, and after careful preparation. But I do not believe that such negotiations can and should be undertaken under the temporal and material pressure of a Russian ultimatum. It is unthinkable that in a period of six months even the basic points of an agreement with the Russians could be found, not least because the points of departure the Russians have created for such negotiations would be the worst imaginable for the West. The six-month deadline imposed by the Russians would hang over all negotiations like a sword of Damocles. For this reason, I am of the opinion that the Berlin question and the larger problem, i.e. that of German reunification, must be treated separately. A linkage of these two questions would either endanger the freedom of Berlin, or set the solution of the general German problem on a track which would have to lead to a more or less veiled capitulation before the Soviet demands. Furthermore, a departure from the repeatedly expressed guarantees for Berlin by the Western powers—allow me to repeat this once more—would ruin the credibility of all Western guarantees. To you of all people, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, who in past years have done so immeasurably much for the cohesion among the countries of the free Western World vis-à-vis the constant communist threat, thanks to your clear conception and the firmness of your convictions and your will power, I need not explain what would be the consequences of even a slightly ambiguous attitude on the entire part of the world that is still free today. I am furthermore of the opinion that the Soviet Union will not resort to force against Berlin if the Western powers show an unmistakably firm attitude.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_183" n="183" facs="0208"/>
<p>These arguments must not be understood to mean that I do not consider it possible that after the Russian attempt with regard to Berlin has been clearly rejected, the time may be ripe, or even favorable, for dealing with other questions which would serve a general relaxation of tensions—compare the Geneva talks—and for taking up the German question in its totality with the Soviets. After the lifting of the blockade, too, negotiations were begun, which, however, did not bring any results at the time. It might be advisable to give an indication that we might be disposed to negotiate, but only after the Kremlin has been made to understand that existing or future agreements with the Soviet Union lose all their value if Moscow insists on the method of unilateral cancellation of existing agreements.</p>
<p>I am writing you these thoughts of mine because there is no possibility of discussing these serious questions with you directly. I believe, as I have already stated in the beginning, that the tone and content of the Paris communiqué will be decisive in the further course of events, for never before in the postwar period was the Western World as dependent on the support of public opinion in all free nations as it is today. It will therefore require a special propaganda effort to enlighten even the neutrally inclined nations on the true character of the Soviet offensive.</p>

While above represents minimum which reply must contain, we believe reply should also take constructive tone and not be limited <pb xml:id="pg_185" n="185" facs="0210"/>to mere restatement of our position and rejection of Soviet position. In addition making underlying issues and our position clear, we believe our reply should recognize interrelation of problems of Berlin, German reunification, European security, and disarmament and should seize opportunity for new diplomatic offensive on this complex of questions. We further believe our reply should be formulated to offset influence which Soviet note may have had on those elements of world opinion which are unfamiliar or unconcerned about Berlin situation and may thus think Western position is unduly rigid. Therefore believe it desirable our reply contain some or all of following:</p>
<list>
<item>1. Proposal for conference of Four Foreign Ministers at stated time and place to discuss problem of Germany and/or security of Berlin within framework of European security and disarmament problems.</item>
<item>2. Indication of some superficial, if not substantial, modification of our previous position re German reunification.</item>
<item>3. Following reiteration of our position re responsibility of Four Powers for Berlin, statement of our willingness discuss with Soviets ways and means of reducing tension in Berlin and improving conditions for Berlin population.</item>
<item>4. Summary of real problems of Berlin which, if Soviets wished make positive contribution, could properly be made subjects for Four Power discussions. Summary should stress maintenance of Berlin’s unity, freedom, and security; freedom of Berlin’s transport and communications; and free determination by population of Berlin both of political and economic regime within city and of city’s political relationships with other parts of Germany.</item>
<item>5. After statement that we recognize achievement of reunification may be long and difficult, proposal that Ambassadors of Four Powers in Germany, assisted by German experts, meet regularly to consider interim measures to minimize hardships which prolonged division of country imposes on population, e.g. to study possibility of assuring freedom of movement from one part of Germany to another, possibility of improving interzonal transport facilities, etc.</item>
<item>6. Statement of our readiness to submit legal dispute with USSR over status of Berlin to International Court of Justice for adjudication.</item>
</list>
<p>C. If joint decision meanwhile reached to revise our contingency planning to avoid dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials, our reply might also, after appropriate reference to six-month deadline set in Soviet note, convey to USSR warning of our intentions as set forth in para A of alternative course of action proposed in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1236 to Bonn.<note n="4" xml:id="d100fn4"><ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>.</note></p>

(Ibid., 762.00/12–1058)</note> <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> led off <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Berlin discussion afternoon December 10 by stressing necessity giving other nations chance to express views before those of four powers firmed up.</p>
<p>Italy noted present <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussion could only be preliminary and real consultation should take place in ministerial meeting. Thought West should be firm against Russian blackmail, should not take solely negative stand but should offer constructive proposal. Thought IS paper (<gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 1599)<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2"><gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 1599, December 8, transmitted the text of PO/58/1548, “The Berlin Question,” drafted by the International Staff, which reviewed the objectives that the Council should have in mind in considering the question. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/12–858)</note> was good starting point.</p>
<p>Greece agreed and added West must outline briefly legal position. Main point that Berliners cannot be abandoned. Belgium noted three points for consideration: (1) must be immediate reaction to Soviet note stating (a) agreements cannot be unilaterally changed, (b) Russians playing with dangerous fire, (c) <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> firm in resisting Soviet demands; (2) if USSR takes action as threatened in note, what happens? Can we avoid contact with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>? (3) What is final answer? Suggested proposing all Berlin be free city with access to West guaranteed and noted rumors Soviets would accept such proposal. Asked if Germans regarded Berlin situation as insoluble apart from solution whole German problem.</p>
<p>Germany, after noting usefulness of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussion, assured <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> questions raised, especially those by Belgium, very much on mind of Germans. Special four power group considering problem but too early to give their views. Certain that reply will not be merely negative. On government instructions assured <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Chancellor in recent statement had not meant Berlin problem should be settled outside general solution but intended merely point out there was 6 month deadline for some settlement on Berlin.</p>
<p>France thought three types problem involved, i.e., procedural, basic (should reply be negative or positive and cover Berlin alone or <pb xml:id="pg_187" n="187" facs="0212"/>Germany as a whole), and immediate (what if <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> replaces Soviets at check points? What about airlift? replenishment of stocks?). Did not think ministerial meeting would produce final reply. Welcomed <gloss target="#t_IS1">IS</gloss> document. Thought Berlin question should be dealt with in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué. There should neither be a counterproposal nor a flat refusal which might induce Soviets to increase pressure and step up timetable of action.</p>
<p>UK agreed with France ministerial meeting unlikely to produce final position. Said (1) Soviet proposals unacceptable; (2) Soviet position wrong juridically; (3) West cannot abandon Berlin. Felt this serious Soviet move in which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> personally involved. Agreed West must be firm but also develop positive approach. This easy to say but difficult develop. Foreign Office felt reply should meet five tests: (1) should not put us in disadvantageous military position if Soviets accept; (2) should appeal to public opinion of Germans and Berliners; (3) should also appeal to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> public opinion; (4) should be difficult for Soviets to refuse to discuss; (5) should contain element of novelty. Re <gloss target="#t_IS1">IS</gloss> paper thought first four paragraphs good but had doubts on fifth paragraph. Felt there should be no interim reply since this would encourage further communication from Soviets.</p>
<p>US welcomed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> discussion and agreed with UK that first 4 paragraphs of <gloss target="#t_IS1">IS</gloss> paper good. Agreed no final reply could be drafted by time of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ministerial meeting. Expressed some doubt re advisability. Thought ministerial meeting should result in firm yet constructive statement of principle on Berlin. Then read summary <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> conversations (<gloss target="#t_Topol1">Topol</gloss> 1952)<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3"><gloss target="#t_Topol1">Topol</gloss> 1952, December 8, transmitted a summary of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> conversation on Berlin (see <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>) for use in the Council discussion on December 10. (Department of State, Central Files, 033.1100–HU/12–858)</note> to very attentive Council.</p>
<p>Denmark agreed Soviet proposals unacceptable and thought would be wiser not have firm reply drafted by ministerial meeting. Suggested there be statement by three powers who had rights in Berlin, supported by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
<p>Canada welcomed this type discussion in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. Hoped four powers would make no statement before ministerial meeting and that formula would be found to say four powers concerned would continue to consult other nine countries.</p>
<p>Spaak concluded discussion by stressing all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries had political responsibility in this matter, though the responsibility of four is a special one. Communiqué will be difficult but must make clear to West and Soviets line beyond which we cannot go, thus meeting essential need to leave line of retreat for Russians. Very important that Western <pb xml:id="pg_188" n="188" facs="0213"/>public opinion must understand if we abandon Berlin and its 2 and a half million people, it will be beginning piecemeal advance by Soviet power akin to way Hitler operated. Stressed that comparison between similarity of Soviet operations and those of Hitler would appeal particularly to Western opinion. We must be clear in what we mean by being firm but must not get in position of making war to prevent Russians from leaving Berlin. Thought we would be faced eventually with problem dealing in some manner with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Thought if Soviets suggested settling Berlin question alone we should tell them they can’t expect us abandon Berlin except in context settlement German problem as whole.</p>

<item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Wilhelm Grewe</persName>, German Embassy</item>
<item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Livingston T. Merchant</persName>—<gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss></item>
<item>Mr. Alfred G. Vigderman—<gloss target="#t_GER1">GER</gloss></item>
</list>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> called at his request to learn the Department’s latest ideas on the Berlin problem as he was taking off for the Experts’ Meeting on Saturday, December 13, and would be seeing his Foreign Minister that evening.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he thought the Paris meetings came at a good time, before positions were frozen. As he saw it now we would deal with the problem roughly as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>1. We would reject the Soviet proposal;</item>
<item>2. We would reassert our rights in Berlin;</item>
<item>3. We would place the Berlin question in the framework of the larger question of Germany; and</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_189" n="189" facs="0214"/>
<item>4. We would express a willingness to negotiate with the Soviets in the broad frame of German reunification and European security.</item>
</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> then turned to the question of the German position on a zone of force and arms limitations, pointing out that if we were to negotiate with the Soviets we would have to have a united position on European security. The Germans had recently indicated their withdrawal from previously agreed positions on the zone of force and arms limitations.</p>
<p>The Ambassador commented that he had been surprised by his Government’s attitude. He did not believe his Government had really withdrawn from its former position and that in any case it could probably return to the old position—there was no big obstacle to overcome. Internal discussions in Bonn have not yet really resulted in firm conclusions. It was true, however, that the Chancellor was worried about too narrow a zone of force and arms limitations.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> expressed himself as reassured with what the Ambassador had said and then remarked that the Ambassador would not find the U.S. position in Paris either weak or wobbly. Any concept of “agency” in treating with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had collapsed. The problem in being firm, however, was the problem of finding the place to make a stand.</p>
<p>The Ambassador went on to describe the Chancellor’s position on Berlin. The West, according to the Chancellor, must have a common position. It cannot negotiate under threat. The elements of ultimatum in the Soviet note must be eliminated. Berlin had to be separated from any other questions about which we might negotiate with the Soviets.</p>
<p>The Ambassador then referred to a <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> article by Sulzberger<note n="1" xml:id="d102fn1"><hi rend="italic">The New York Times,</hi> December 12, 1958, p. 38.</note> in which it had been suggested that West Berlin could be integrated into the Federal Republic and the Western garrisons replaced by Bundeswehr contingents. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> went on to say it was his personal feeling that this proposal on the one hand would be unacceptable to the Soviets, and on the other hand was very dangerous. The presence of Bundeswehr units could not be equated to the presence of the allied forces for obvious psychological and political reasons. Moreover, the Sulzberger suggestion overlooks the very important question of free access to Berlin. Moreover, said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>, the people of Berlin do not mind their occupation status. In part the West Berlin election was testimony to this fact.</p>
<p>The Ambassador then adverted to the idea attributed to Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> involving the internationalization of communication lines between West Germany and West Berlin, with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces assuring the freedom of Berlin. The Ambassador then asked rhetorically which <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> <pb xml:id="pg_190" n="190" facs="0215"/>members were ready to participate and accept such a responsibility. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> was impairing the present legal position with this proposal. It would plainly be difficult to cope with public opinion in opposing a proposal involving the creation of a four-sector free city guaranteed by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. It had to be remembered that if such a proposal were to be accepted and a new blockade imposed the West would then have the problem of taking care of the people who live in East Berlin as well as those in West Berlin so that the burden of countering a blockade was increased by the needs of one and one-half million people.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> and the Ambassador agreed that there may be superficially attractive alternatives but none so far proposed were really acceptable.</p>
<p>The conversation then turned to the possibility of taking the Berlin problem to the International Court of Justice. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> thought such a move might have considerable merit at a later stage, after we made our position crystal-clear. It is a useful secondary operation, not to be undertaken until a Western reply had been registered. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> agreed that it would be useful to provide the Soviets with this kind of possibility of retreat if the Soviets had in fact decided to retreat. The Ambassador remarked semi-seriously that before the Berlin problem was allowed to go before the International Court, a careful canvass ought to be made of the makeup of the present Bench in order to have some idea of how the matter was likely to be received by the Court.</p>

Embassy telegram 2166 to Department.<note n="1" xml:id="d103fn1">Telegram 2166, December 10, transmitted French views on the paper that <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> had given to the Western Ambassadors on December 8 (see <ref target="#d88">Document 88</ref>). The French believed the reply should be made quickly with a firm rejection of the Soviet proposals, the present contingency plans were adequate, and a four-power working group should be established, but not at Bonn. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/12–1058)</note> <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> made following comments to me this morning which modify or supplement <pb xml:id="pg_191" n="191" facs="0216"/>French view on Western response to Soviet note on Berlin, as outlined referenced telegram.</p>
<p>He definitely favors sending Western reply as soon as possible, preferably before Christmas. He suggested it might be desirable in interests of speed for quadripartite drafting group to stay on in Paris after <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting to work on reply. Although expressing complete agreement to participation Federal Republic in drafting Western response, he reiterated French objections to Bonn as location for drafting group. In addition reasons previously cited and reported by Embassy for this French position, he said drafting in Bonn might be provocative as far as Soviets are concerned.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he feels Western replies should be separate, with substance the same but not identical in wording.</p>
<p>Minister confirmed that French do not believe it would be advisable to make counter-proposals on Berlin itself or advance new proposals on German reunification which would represent any change in basic Western position adopted Geneva 1955. However, he thinks Western powers should reiterate willingness discuss with Soviets questions of German reunification, European security and peace treaty.</p>
<p>On possible revision in contingency planning re access to Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he was not familiar with details this problem, which should be put to experts in first instance. (Embassy has previously reported Foreign Office working level view that present plan is about as far as we should go.)<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">See <ref target="#d102fn1">footnote 1</ref> above.</note></p>
<p>Coüve agrees there must be mention of Berlin in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué, but he feels statement should not be too detailed. He believes it will be more effective if main lines of Western position are left to be formulated in replies of US, UK and France to Soviet note.</p>
<p>Although <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> spoke firmly of unacceptability of Soviet proposals, he said it is clear that biggest and most immediate problem before us relates to use of forces to protect allied rights in Berlin. Should we use force? If so, at what stage, to what extent, and where? <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> indicated that he had come to no firm conclusions himself on these questions, which he expects will be thrashed out in Foreign Ministry talks over weekend.</p>

As regards this letter, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed the opinion that our best argument against the USSR is that the USSR has served notice that in six months they will unilaterally repudiate a four-power agreement, a thing which they have no right to do. In the light of the threatening nature of the November 27 Soviet note, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> does not recommend negotiations under these conditions. We can meet later, but in the meantime, the status quo must stand and be recognized.</p>
<p>The President stated, with respect to the <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> letter, only that he agreed on the separation of the subjects of Berlin and unification of Germany. He agrees that the issues are separate and distinct. Some discussion then transpired as to the situation in the British foreign office, with an effort to explain recent inconsistencies. The President was of the opinion that the British government is, at the moment, confused.</p>

</list>
<p>The Secretary began by noting that the Germans were anxious to have a strong substantive communiqué issued by the Foreign Ministers after their meeting on December 14. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> was opposed to this, and there was some reason for his opposition. However, the Secretary observed, it seems likely that the Foreign Ministers will have to say something. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had already prepared a draft communiqué which might be issued by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that his own disposition was to be rather tough in responding to the Soviets. Their proposal struck him as outrageous both in tone and substance. We had made an arrangement with them giving up Saxony and Thuringia in exchange for entry into the three Western sectors of Berlin. They had consolidated their position in the area which we had relinquished; now they want us to move out of Berlin. The Soviets talk of negotiating new agreements in the same breath as, they denounce the old agreements. What is the point of arriving at agreements if they are going to be subject to unilateral denunciation when they no longer serve the purpose of one of the parties?</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_194" n="194" facs="0219"/>
<p>The Secretary noted that there was some difference of view as to whether or not a proposal for general negotiations should be included in the same document replying to the Soviet note. The Germans were apparently opposed to this, particularly <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> said that it was necessary to distinguish between the position of the Chancellor now, and the position which he might take a little later. He thought that the Chancellor would eventually accept, under pressure of public and party opinion in Germany, the idea of a proposal for negotiations. We would know this a little more clearly when the Germans stated their views on December 14.</p>
<p>The Secretary commented that the difficult thing is to find the point at which physically there would be a break with the Soviets. If our new contingency paper were to be accepted, that would establish the point, but it was doubtful that it would be accepted. The Secretary said he was convinced that the Soviets did not want general war with us and will not consciously get into one. The problem is to make the issue sufficiently clear-cut. Otherwise, a little shooting might grow into big shooting. The issue in this instance is elusive, and it is not clear how it will be posed.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> said that we must be prepared to be tough from the beginning, assuming the analysis of the Soviet intentions made by the Secretary were correct. If we do not have a firm position on our part, we will not get even a comparatively firm position from our Allies. The Secretary said that this was true enough, but did not really meet the basic problem he had just mentioned. We are prepared to be strong and tough, but how does this work out in specific terms? He referred to the case of a convoyed truck and the decision which would have to be made to shoot or not, but that would not accomplish much. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> said that, if we told the Soviets we are going to maintain our access by surface and where, there may be incidents and we might be faced by a crisis, but we will never know this unless we take such a stand. The British are inclined to temporize and to accept facto recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified].</hi> However, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] the British, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassfied</hi>] are prepared to be relatively tough on Berlin. The West Germans know that the U.S. Government is determined and ready to employ force if necessary to maintain our access to Berlin. But the problem of how to deal with the other Allies who want to take a weaker position faces them.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that the decision which we may be faced with next week is whether, if the British and French refuse to accept our proposals for revision of contingency plans, we are prepared to go it alone. If such a decision is taken, the sooner we tell the Russians this, the less possibility there would be of incidents. He was opposed to changing the point at which we would be prepared to use force.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_195" n="195" facs="0220"/>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> said that, if we took a strong position on Berlin, we should also propose a conference related to this firm position to give the Soviets a way out. Such a simultaneous proposal of a conference might also make it easier for the British and French to take a firm position. Going it alone would cost the West a great deal. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> commented that, as soon as <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is certain of the firmness of our own position, he will agree to anything. He would also therefore accept the idea of a meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> said he thought that the time when we should plan to resort to force would be that point where it would be credible to the Soviets that we would do so. This point did not seem to be that where <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials would require credentials of our official travelers. A better point would be the clear blockage of our rights. The Secretary commented that there would not be any such clear blockage of our rights. Rather there would be a slow process of strangulation. The principles are elusive. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials will say that certainly they will let us go through if we comply. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> noted that, in the air, there may be incidents of a real war-like nature.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that we certainly have to stop this somewhere. We must ignore the fear of general war. It is coming anyway. Therefore we should force the issue on a point we think is right and stand on it. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is trying to scare people. If he succeeds, we are through.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> mentioned a dinner given recently by the President of the Bundestag, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName>, at which political leaders of all parties were present. They were unanimous in stressing that the U.S. must, if necessary, use force to maintain its position in Germany, even when illogically the same leaders were opposed to arming the Bundeswehr with atomic weapons. This was true also of German trade union leaders with whom the Ambassador had recently met in Dusseldorf.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that there was no doubt in anybody’s mind that, if we give way, it would be a disaster, and that we would face the same threat later under even worse conditions. We all know what the problem is, but grappling with it in specific terms is difficult.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> said that, as he saw it, it was difficult to find the point where force could be applied. Berlin was isolated and some better way of securing our access thereto should be our limited objective in the present exercise. Therefore, there should be a conference on this subject. There was no doubt in the Defense Department about the necessity of taking a firm position.</p>
<p>The Secretary mentioned that the 1949 Paris Conference reached agreement on access to Berlin, but that had not stuck. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> noted that nothing would really satisfy the Berliners except the <pb xml:id="pg_196" n="196" facs="0221"/>continuance of the American guarantee. If we get over the present situation, the same problem will still be with us.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 4. Quadripartite working level group met morning and afternoon today, Dec. 13, at <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> to consider questions of procedure and substance in connection with handling of Soviet note on Berlin. Delegations of France, Germany, UK, US headed respectively by <persName corresp="#p_LJ1">Laloy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>, Rumboldt, <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName>. Ambassadors to Bonn of France, UK, US joined group in afternoon.</p>
<p>Working group attempted to provide answers to questions posed in questionnaire prepared by French along lines of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> questionnaire given to three Ambassadors in Bonn last week by <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d106fn1">The French questionnaire had three parts: 1) procedure in responding to the Soviet note, 2) substance of the response, and 3) substantive questions about Berlin that would not be dealt with in the reply. A copy of the French text of the questionnaire is attached to a memorandum of conversation, dated December 11.

<item>1. Should communiqué to be issued after quadripartite <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> meeting Dec. 14 be substantive or non-committal? Germans are pressing for firm, substantive language in communiqué.</item>
<item>2. Can Western replies to Soviet note of Nov. 27 suggest counterproposals or should we refuse to suggest any counter-proposals until Soviets withdraw ultimative character of their note? <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> indicated Germans preferred latter.</item>
<item>3. Group agreed that, if counter-proposals made, they should not be limited to Berlin directly but should refer to German problem as whole.

<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said he had just been to see <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> about this afternoon’s Foreign Ministers meeting, and its relationship to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council meeting. The question was whether the draft communiqué prepared by the working group yesterday could form a basis for discussion this afternoon.<note n="1" xml:id="d107fn1">Not found, but see <ref target="#d106">Document 106</ref>.</note></p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he thought it could be a basis of discussion. He did not think the Secretary was likely to accept it entirely in its present form, our inclination was to keep the substantive content to a minimum, reserving a more detailed declaration for a communiqué to be published by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council. This draft, he thought, should be somewhat more factual and less declaratory.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had pointed out that we should be aware of the fact that since 1954, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had assumed its own commitments with regard to Berlin, which had been renewed in December, 1957.<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">For text of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Heads of Government communiqué, December 19, 1957, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> January 6, 1958, pp. 12–15.</note> <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s point and that we should avoid giving the impression that in today’s meeting, the Foreign Ministers had in any way prejudiced the Council’s position or decision. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> <pb xml:id="pg_198" n="198" facs="0223"/>went on to say that, while he understood <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s views, German and world opinion would react in an unfavorable manner if no strong or convincing public declaration were made by the Foreign Ministers today. There would not be much point merely in saying that they were united. The press would interpret this as meaning that the reason why they had confined themselves to speaking about unity was precisely because they were not united.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said the Secretary feels the Four should state they agree that the Soviet proposals should be rejected as being totally unacceptable. It was desirable to eliminate from the communiqué anything which would have an adverse effect, in view of the sensitivity of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> went on to say that he was adopting this course with some hesitation. He said he thought there was a danger that, because of the different views and attitudes of various members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué would represent the lowest common denominator of these views, just as the speed of a convoy is that of the slowest ship. He said he thought there were two decisions to be taken today: First, an internal decision among the Four with regard to their common position, which would remain “in the desk drawer” until Tuesday; second, a decision on the declaration to be published today, in which it would be stated that the Foreign Ministers would report to the Council on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At this point Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHAV1">Blankenhorn</persName> intervened to say that <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had insisted that, in order to preserve <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> unity, a final communiqué must on no account be published today. He summarized <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s ideas on what should be said today as follows: “The Three (or the Four) Foreign Ministers are agreed that their legal position in Berlin should be upheld. There is no legal reason to accept the Soviet proposal. However, the Soviet note carries with it certain political implications which should be discussed within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, because it has assumed certain obligations with regard to Berlin in 1954 which have been renewed in l957.”</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he hoped that this afternoon’s communiqué would essentially meet <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s concern but would make it clear that the Soviet proposal was unacceptable.</p>
<p>There followed some confused and confusing comments by <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BHAV1">Blankenhorn</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SAHV1">Van Scherpenberg</persName> on how many papers needed to be prepared. Out of this confusion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> clarified the situation as follows: He said he did not think we needed to envisage more than two papers. What was required was (1) today’s Foreign Ministers’ communiqué, which should not go into too much detail, and should protect <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s legitimate interests in the subject; (2) during the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> discussion of the Berlin item, one, or perhaps even all four Ministers, <pb xml:id="pg_199" n="199" facs="0224"/>would present an oral report along commonly agreed lines. This report would end by saying that the essential points of the position agreed on by the Four had been summarized in a paper which would then be handed to <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> for incorporation in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué as the part on Berlin.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHAV1">Blankenhorn</persName> said there was, nevertheless, a danger that the paper which <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> might draw up would be weaker than the position taken by the Four.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said, speaking personally, he felt the Four should reserve the right to publish their own statement independently of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué, in the event that the other members of the Council should insist on watering their position down too much.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said he hoped that the other members would go along with the position taken by the Four.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHAV1">Blankenhorn</persName> expressed himself as not being entirely sanguine on this point, and referred to the possible effect of yesterday’s Soviet note to all the members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">A translation of this December 13 note was transmitted in telegram 1262 from Moscow, December 13. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–PA/12–1358) The Russianlanguage text was transmitted as an enclosure to despatch 341 from Moscow, December 15. (Ibid., 396.1–PA/12–1558)</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said he had talked with Prime Minister Hansen of Denmark on December 12, and that the latter’s position at that time was perfectly clear and sound.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> observed that the Soviet note to the members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was practically standard operational procedure immediately preceding meetings of the Western powers.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHAV1">Blankenhorn</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had suggested that the discussion on Berlin take place in secret session first thing in the morning session on December 16, in order that the whole day should be available for this purpose.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> that the Berlin question should become Point I on Tuesday. It was desirable that any differences that may exist should be smoked out at once and not be allowed to subsist undiscussed.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> agreed and said he would make recommendations to the Secretary along these lines. He observed that the longer discussion was postponed and a public position taken, the more the press would speculate. He thought it might be a good thing to issue a special communiqué on Berlin by Tuesday evening.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said he thought the working group communiqué could stand some shortening, but that, essentially, it meets <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s concern.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_200" n="200" facs="0225"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> agreed that it pretty well met the criteria just discussed.</p>
<p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_BHAV1">Blankenhorn</persName> made some comments suggesting that he did not agree with this, and that he was in favor of cutting the present draft down and reserving the substantive part for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> raised some procedural questions with regard to this afternoon, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he thought it might be a good idea to start the meeting by discussing the working group communiqué.</p>
<p>In conclusion it was agreed that the German Delegation would draft a preliminary text of a communiqué for discussion in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and would have it ready in time for the 4:30 meeting this afternoon.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 10. French Chairman opened meeting French, U.K. and U.S. Foreign Ministers after tripartite lunch at Quai d’Orsay at 1440 hours today.</p>
<p>Secretary began by noting might be useful to consider at early stage, and before arrival of Germans, question of revision existing contingency plans which we had raised with British and French.<note n="1" xml:id="d108fn1">See <ref target="#d98fn5">Document 98 and footnote 5</ref> thereto.</note> American initiative had been approved at highest level of government, and in essence we would like to revise instructions for Allied personnel on military trains and autobahn. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> queried whether Secretary envisaged doing something in this field before replies sent to Soviet notes of November 27. Secretary said we wanted to change contingency plans now. We could not rely on six months waiting period stipulated by Soviets before changes to be made. If <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials appeared at check point tomorrow our people would operate on basis of agency theory which no longer valid.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> queried why there was no mention of air access in American proposals. He had impression air communications were most important <pb xml:id="pg_201" n="201" facs="0226"/>to Allied position in Berlin, and he had thought that solution, as in 1948, would be to maintain communications of Berlin garrisons by air. Secretary responded that U.S. proposal did not deal with all contingencies, but was meant to eliminate present authority to treat <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> representatives as agents of Soviets. It dealt with aspect of problem which had aroused considerable emotional response in Federal Republic.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said British could accept points A to C set forth in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1236 to Bonn, 327 to Berlin, 2147 to Paris, 559 to London and 945 to Moscow.<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2"><ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>.</note> Point D however, involving question of using military action to try force way through, he considered to be in different category. He agreed we should make our position clear to Soviets and instruct our people accordingly, but contemplated military action was not part of same exercise. This would have to be considered separately. As to point E he was not quite clear as to whether this was consistent with A B and C, but in any case paragraph D involved a completely different range of discussion.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he had same opinion as <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, and could approve proposed changes only up to and including point C. It was obvious that we could not accept idea that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials are just agents of Soviets if it said in advance that Soviets are giving up all their rights to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. However, would have to think further about point D.</p>
<p>Secretary stated that point D contemplated show of force in order to test whether there would be resistance by force. If it agreeable to colleagues to accept A to C point D could be reserved for further consideration.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> added that he thought point A re informing Soviet Government would be largely taken care of by replies to November 27 Soviet note. Secretary agreed. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> added that Foreign Ministers should accordingly instruct their representatives in Bonn to reconsider their instructions. In summary, Secretary stated agreement reached that instead of accepting <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> processing at check points, Allied officials would be instructed to turn back.</p>
<p>After further discussion in which Foreign Ministers summarized their understanding of agreement along lines indicated by Secretary above, in response to query by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, Secretary agreed that point E did not need to be considered at this juncture. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> commented that our juridical case is that we have agreements with Soviets which we cannot allow them to renounce. Foreign Ministers agreed that Germans would be told that we would not treat <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials as agents of Soviets or substitutes for Soviets.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_202" n="202" facs="0227"/>
<p>There was further discussion re agency theory. <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> noted that we could refuse <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials right to stamp our passports, but whole Allied moral position was that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials were merely stooges of Soviets. This was concept to which we must continue to adhere. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> added that stooge idea was essential, and therefore public treatment of new approach would present special problems. Secretary pointed out this was a particular case. Stooge theory was fine but when <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials purport to act as independent people then we could not accept their processing. We must, of course, be careful in any general pronouncements not to imply that they are independent. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that, if <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials put themselves forward as Soviet agents we would, of course, accept this. What we must reject was their putting themselves forward as principals. Secretary noted that our position should be put primarily in terms of not accepting responsibility of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as substitute for Soviets.</p>
<p>Discussion moved to subject of communiqué. Secretary noted that Germans wanted substantive communiqué and that <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> seemed concerned about this. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> had seen <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> at noon.<note n="3" xml:id="d108fn3">See <ref target="#d107">Document 107</ref>.</note> As a result he thought it would be agreeable to Germans if communiqué were brief indicating that Soviet note unacceptable in form and substance and that views of four powers would be laid before <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting, after which more detailed statement would be made. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that position of <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> was that it desirable to have firm four-power communiqué but not one giving impression four Ministers had agreed on all details and were presenting <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council with fait accompli. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> also felt consideration should be given to more detailed and precise statement to be issued by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Council on Tuesday, either as part of communiqué dealing with Tuesday discussion, or as separate release after Council discussion on Berlin.</p>
<p>During discussion of possible contents of four-power communiqué, Secretary said he thought it should mention exchange of views by Ministers, that they found Soviet note unacceptable in form and substance, that views of four powers were harmonious and would be laid before <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Council, after which more complete and detailed declaration would be made. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he felt communiqué should contain three points: (a) attitude of Ministers that Soviet demands unacceptable, (b) that instructions being sent to Ambassadors in Bonn to make clear that we would not accept substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials, and (c) discussion of Soviet notes by Foreign Ministers reflected wide agreement preparatory to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_203" n="203" facs="0228"/>
<p>Small drafting party formed to prepare tripartite version of communiqué which, it was agreed, French Chairman should present to four-power meeting as his own draft.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 9. After opening remarks by French Chairman, quadripartite ministerial meeting, which began 16:45 hours today, got underway with long introductory statement by <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName>. He said maintenance of Berlin as free city depended on continuing willingness of three governments to defend their position there. Ultimatum like demands of Soviet Union raised grave issues. Soviets did not propose negotiations to improve situation in Berlin, but at most were willing to elaborate their demands for basic revision Western position. Proposal for free city of West Berlin meant that present dual division of Germany would become triple division, and solution of German reunification problem would become ever more difficult as <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> moved towards complete recognition. Free portion of Berlin would have to sever ties with Federal Republic and its further development would be completely dependent on benevolence of Soviet Zone. So-called international status of West Berlin would be illusion and Soviets would find occasion to intervene. If link to Federal Republic severed, Berlin economy would quickly collapse. Mood of Berliners was still good, but could change overnight if they thought Western support not firm. Foreign Ministers should therefore show their determination, and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council should subsequently reaffirm association with Berlin guarantees. Berliners would regard what happened in next few days as test of Western steadfastness. If West failed on this issue, other countries of free world would begin to doubt firmness of purpose and would look for new ways to protect themselves through direct talks with Soviets. West must therefore respond firmly to <pb xml:id="pg_204" n="204" facs="0229"/>Soviet demands or else surrender to force. Consideration should also be given to accompanying display firm resolution by appeal to Soviet Union and entire world to rally forces interested in saving peace. He was convinced that Soviet Union would not carry through its plans if faced by determined resistance of free world. Soviet Union was intensifying war of nerves and if we were not firm, we would all go down together.</p>
<p>At this point, Governing Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> of Berlin entered room and was welcomed by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> who asked him to make statement on behalf of Berlin. After expression gratitude for help of Western countries which had assisted in reconstruction of Berlin during past decade, he emphasized all this was now threatened by new Soviet move. Berliners had much self confidence as well as confidence in their Allied friends as evidenced by elections of December 7 in which Communist Unity Party obtained only 1.9 percent of total vote. He felt that this election had been a real plebiscite in rejection of Soviet proposals. Soviet proposal only superficial solution with ultimate aim really complete absorption of Berlin into Soviet controlled area. Some damage had already been done to economic life of city, but people were prepared for difficulties. It was not appropriate for him to give advice to Foreign Ministers, but he wished to make appeal in accordance with feeling of population of Berlin that fight must be continued for freedom of city. After expression of sympathy and support by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> left room.</p>
<p>Discussion then moved to four-power communiqué. French circulated draft which had been prepared before meeting by tripartite working group.<note n="1" xml:id="d109fn1">The draft under reference has not been found, but see <ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said he also had draft to submit.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">A copy of the German draft communiqué is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1174.</note> After brief discussion, another drafting group was set up to refine German draft as basis for four-power communiqué.</p>
<p>Using map for illustrative purposes, Secretary said he would like to make a point often forgotten. He noted that 1944–45 agreements which Soviets now proposed to repudiate had been relied on by us in falling back from Saxony and Thuringia which we had occupied by end of war. Modest quid pro quo which we received was entry into three Western sectors of Berlin which at that time was little more than pile of rubble. He had noted no suggestion from Soviets that they should give up this area which we had left, whereas they were asking us to surrender our sectors of Berlin. Secretary thought it might be worthwhile to make this point to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council, since people tend to forget historical basis of agreements. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said point should be made publicly, and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> added it <pb xml:id="pg_205" n="205" facs="0230"/>would also be very good to include in reply to Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> nodded assent.</p>
<p>Ministers then spent considerable time examining draft submitted by <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> of suggested communiqué or declaration to be issued by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Council. Secretary objected to final paragraph as unnecessary at this stage since it pre-supposes that replies would contain counter-proposals. We did not yet know whether they would or not. At present point, we were confronted with Soviet note purporting unilaterally to repudiate obligations. They had given us six months ultimatum. Whether under these conditions we would want to make proposals not clear. It was not good practice to negotiate under threat of an ultimatum, and perhaps first thing to do was to get ultimatum withdrawn. In any event, we would be reluctant to see question foreclosed by having language included in communiqué expressing hope that proposals be set forth in Western replies to Soviet notes.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers agreed that last paragraph should be stricken. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> made point that document issued by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council should not, in effect, summarize future reply of Western powers to Soviet Union. This could only be finally determined when replies drafted. It was agreed that expert group would be set up to draft suggested communiqué for issuance by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Council. This was not to be presented in advance, but slipped in towards end of Berlin discussion, although it might be shown previously to <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> who also had submitted possible text of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué to Four Foreign Ministers.<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">Neither of the drafts under reference here has been found. The expert group comprised <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, Daridan, <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>, and their advisers. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D 327)</note></p>
<p>Discussion then considered series of questions and answers prepared by quadripartite working group which had met twice December 13.<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">See <ref target="#d106">Document 106</ref>.</note> Ministers accepted recommendation that portion of Soviet note containing specific proposals ought to be subject of identical replies, but that other portions of replies dealing with refutation of propaganda arguments need only be coordinated. It was understood that reply of Federal Republic would necessarily differ in form from other replies in view of its different juridical position, but that in substance <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> reply would be on same lines.</p>
<p>Re timing of reply, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> pressed for as early a date as possible, perhaps even before Christmas. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> was reluctant to move ahead so fast and pointed out that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultative processes required some time. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> and Secretary both supported moving ahead with reply as rapidly as feasible. Secretary pointed out we would be subject <pb xml:id="pg_206" n="206" facs="0231"/>to criticism if we seem to fritter away time. Accordingly, it agreed that special quadripartite drafting party would begin work in effort to achieve replies along lines indicated above as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Further discussion of whether notes should be short or long, or include historical references in text (as desired by British and Germans) or in annex (as preferred by French), led to conclusion that this really a matter to be decided in terms of needs each country. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> made point that it was easier for Soviets to suppress annex than a single unified text. Hence, British favored putting historical arguments in body of note, which might have some chance of being published in Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It agreed that there should be no provisional reply to Soviet notes, and that further meeting of Foreign Ministers to approve work of experts not required. There was also agreement that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting should reaffirm action taken re Berlin in 1954, and that <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> would make report to Ministerial Council re four-power meeting today. Decision was deferred as to whether quadripartite working group similar to that which met in 1957 and 1958 should be established to draw up proposals for procedure and further action re Berlin crisis. Experts had pointed out that such meeting would be necessary if reply were to envisage possibility of discussion of German problem as a whole. Ministers also agreed that propaganda measures to be taken to counter Soviet proposals should be handled by individual action of four governments.</p>
<p>On question of substance, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> mentioned that French draft which already prepared made no reference to counter-proposals, although it implies that discussion on German problem as a whole was always possible. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he hesitated to qualify Soviet proposal as ultimatum in Western replies. He would rather ask Soviets if they had intended to issue ultimatum, and tell them, if this were case, that it was not acceptable. Secretary agreed, remarking that it was important to leave Soviets a way out. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> concurred.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> mentioned that, in talks earlier today, it agreed that agency argument as applied to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials needed careful handling.<note n="5" xml:id="d109fn5">See <ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note> Western powers say that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials are stooges of Russians, but agree that they will not permit substitution of such officials for Soviets. If <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> representatives were to say they are acting as Soviet agents, that would be acceptable, but as they say they are acting for themselves, Western position must be one of refusing to deal with them. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> pointed out that agency theory no longer pertinent in view of assertion of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty. It would only be possible to maintain theory if Soviets were using <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials as agents to carry out their obligations, but note of November 27 states Soviets no longer have such obligations. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said <pb xml:id="pg_207" n="207" facs="0232"/>there was no disagreement on this point. All he meant was that if <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials were to claim they were acting as Soviet agents we would have no reason to object. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> agreed.</p>
<p>Secretary queried whether <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> should be asked to modify agenda for Ministerial meeting so that Berlin could be discussed on Tuesday morning. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> indicated that <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had already said this would be acceptable.</p>
<p>Ministers reworked at some length text of four-power communiqué as prepared by drafting group (sent separate message).<note n="6" xml:id="d109fn6">In <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 6 from Paris, December 14, 11 p.m. (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560) For text of this communiqué, which reaffirmed the determination of the three Western powers to maintain their rights and position in Berlin and stated that unilateral repudiation by the Soviet Union of its obligations in Berlin was unacceptable, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> December 29, 1958, pp. 1041–1042.</note></p>
<p>Before meeting terminated, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked what should be said to press. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested journalists might be told that Ministers had been discussing replies to Soviet notes. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> argued strongly against any statements going beyond communiqué on ground that different answers to various questions which might be posed would cause speculation about possible differences of views. It agreed Ministers would make no statements on meeting except generalities to effect that it had been profitable and harmonious, and that subject would again be discussed in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Council.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 1718. From: US Del. Subject: Berlin discussion at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting.<note n="1" xml:id="d112fn1">Further documentation on the North Atlantic Council Ministerial Meeting at Paris, December 16–18, is presented in volume VII, Part 1.</note> French <gloss target="#t_CF1">FonMin</gloss> began discussion on Berlin in restricted Ministerial session this morning by reporting to Council results of quadripartite meeting Dec. 14.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">The verbatim, <gloss target="#t_CVR1">C–VR</gloss>(58)61, and summary, C–R(58)61, records of this December 16 session, both dated December 16, are in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1168. A two-page summary of the meeting and drafting session that followed is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D 327. Regarding the quadripartite meeting on December 14, see <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> He made point that earlier meeting not intended to reach decisions, but to have preliminary exchange of views between the three responsible powers in Berlin and <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. As Foreign Ministers aware, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> continued, communiqué published after meeting<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">For text of this communiqué, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> December 29, 1958, pp. 1041–1042.</note> reminded world of agreement of three powers to maintain their rights in Berlin, including that of access, and that they would wish to consult their <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. Four Foreign Ministers shared view these rights could not be ended unilaterally by Soviets and that withdrawal of Western troops from Berlin could take place only as result of freely negotiated treaty. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> added that idea of free city of West Berlin was unacceptable to Foreign Ministers. It would prevent reunification of Germany. On reply to Soviet note of Nov. 27, Foreign Ministers had agreed that in drafting text they must consider need for support of public opinion. In view of six months period stipulated by Soviets, several exchanges of notes with them must be expected. One point Ministers had concluded must be stressed was that Berlin not an isolated problem. It is part of larger German problem, and Western powers must indicate that they are not unwilling to negotiate on German reunification and are always ready to do so. Foreign Ministers had reached firm agreement on principles, but had not shut door on negotiations if Soviets were willing to exclude threat of ultimatum.</p>
<p>In light of today’s discussion, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> stated, drafting would quickly get under way in order to enable replies to be sent to Moscow as quickly as possible. Replies would be coordinated as far as practicable, especially in their essential portions. Reply of Federal Republic would vary somewhat on form because of different juridical situation and differences <pb xml:id="pg_209" n="209" facs="0234"/>in note received by it from Soviets.<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4">For text of the Soviet note to the West German Government, November 27, see <hi rend="italic">Moskau Bonn,</hi> pp. 464–470.</note> In any case, four powers would further consult in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> before sending replies to obtain advice re proposed texts.</p>
<p>Next speaker was German Foreign Minister who fully supported report just made by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>. He stressed importance of Council’s issuing statement on Berlin today, since people of city were awaiting results of Paris meetings. For more than ten years, Berlin had been concern of entire free world which had shown its solidarity with city. Soviet notes would deprive Berlin of all protection and put it at mercy of Communists. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said that as free city under Soviet proposal, Berlin would cease to be symbol it now is as refugee flow from East dried up and freedom of city could be abolished at any time. He hoped Ministerial Council could adopt as its own, statement of December 14. Council was aware of role of Berlin in East-West struggle. It should remind world of this in official communiqué.</p>
<p>Only solution to Berlin problem, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> continued, is to make Berlin capital of free and united Germany. Until this achieved, there could only be regime of Western troops remaining under rights of occupation. <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> does not want to be provocative. Negotiations with Soviets are indispensable. It would be unwise to push latter into unwise decisions, but threats are not point of departure for constructive negotiations. If West adopted firm attitude, he believed Soviets would give some. If on other hand, West failed to show unity, evidencing premature willingness to negotiate, it would lose ground gradually and capitulate in long run.</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister stated that communiqué issued after Dec. 14 meeting and report just given by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had very well stressed position of firmness that must characterize Western world in face of Soviet initiative. Soviets had tried to put Berlin problem in forefront. Appropriate answer to Soviet note must reaffirm respect for Berlin status, but must also combat propaganda efforts of Soviets. Atlantic Alliance was founded to protect peace, but positions of members were not always coordinated by broader action in political field. We find ourselves in position where Soviets pretend this initiative intended make contribution to peace. West should respond quickly to Soviet note with immediate coordinated position to contain momentum of Soviet proposals.</p>
<p>Secretary, who spoke next, began by noting that bold Soviet acts in early post-war period, such as seizure of Czechoslovakia and Berlin <pb xml:id="pg_210" n="210" facs="0235"/>blockade, had largely led to creation of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.<note n="5" xml:id="d112fn5">A copy of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ remarks is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1176.</note> Since organization in being, Western countries were able to congratulate themselves that no comparable threats had arisen in Europe, although they had occurred in Far East and Mid-East. Now for first time in nearly decade, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries were faced with threat in Europe of grave character. In considering how we deal with this threat, Secretary continued, it would be well to take account of personality of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, who is different from coldly calculating Molotov or Stalin. He is a person who is easily buoyed up by success, impulsive, with certain characteristics of gambler. He reminded one of figures of the past who, having had initial successes, went on and on, and eventually brought disaster to the world. It is therefore essential to the peace of the world that he not have success, even partial success, in this instance. If he does, it will lead to a series of events culminating in disaster for us all.</p>
<p>Present stroke aimed at Berlin, probably because it an isolated and militarily indefensible city. Perhaps Soviets saw opportunity for creating dissension between Allies. In that respect, Soviet action was similar to probings elsewhere. They want to get rid of free-world position in Berlin. It provides unbearable contrast with surrounding satellite areas. Soviet rulers talk glibly of co-existence, but here where there is example of such co-existence, West Berlin’s demonstration of freedom is so much more impressive that Soviets find it unbearable. Secretary said he did not know how many of Foreign Ministers present had recently been in Berlin. He had been there in May after Copenhagen Conference<note n="6" xml:id="d112fn6">Documentation on the Copenhagen meeting of the North Atlantic Council, May 5–7, is presented in volume VII, Part 1. Regarding <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ visit to Berlin on May 8, see <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> and was impressed by sense of vibrant and creative life there which demonstrated freedom in way which it easy to understand Communists could not like. If we allowed this to be blotted out, it would be a disastrous blow to freedom and ultimately to world peace.</p>
<p>Secretary said he wished to refer briefly to Soviet note of Nov. 27 which started out with gross and insulting distortion of history. To justify their proposed action re Berlin, Soviets had re-written history to pretend World War II was caused by Western Allies, especially British and French, who incited Hitler to attack Soviets. Suggestion was history now being repeated. Because memories are short, some may have forgotten how gross a distortion this is. Secretary at this point quoted from text of speech made by Molotov to Supreme Soviet on Oct. 31, 1938<note n="7" xml:id="d112fn7">For a summary of this speech, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> The Soviet Union, 1933–1939, pp. 786–790.</note> expounding Soviet policy at that time. Statements of then Soviet Foreign Minister <pb xml:id="pg_211" n="211" facs="0236"/>were better history than distortions in Soviet note. Everyone knows that post-war policy of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> in cooperation with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies is to bring about such integration, military, political and economic, with countries of Europe that never again would there be possibility of Germany pursuing such course as under Hitler. This was great statesmanlike policy, above all reflected in views of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>.</p>
<p>As to substance of note, Secretary continued, it unilaterally asserted that agreements re Germany of 1944–45 are null and void. These were agreements entered into re respective zones of occupation in Germany when war ended. They were greatly in interest of Soviet Union. At time of end of hostilities, British and American troops occupied considerable areas which were turned over to Soviets as we fell back in reliance on these agreements (Secretary used map as at four-power meeting on Dec. 14 to illustrate graphically extent of area involved). In return Allies received few square miles of rubble in largely destroyed city of Berlin. Soviets have now consolidated their position in East Germany, and agreements are declared null and void, as far as advantages Western powers obtained concerned. Soviet Union does not propose to disgorge advantages it obtained under same agreements.</p>
<p>Note goes on to state, Secretary added, Soviets will turn over to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control of our air, water, and land space around Berlin and give it responsibility hitherto exercised by Soviets over allied transit movements to and from Berlin. Such action would violate not only agreements of 1944–45, but also more recent agreements, for example that reached in Council of Foreign Ministers in Paris in June 1949<note n="8" xml:id="d112fn8">For text of the final communiqué of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, June 20, 1949, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 1949, vol. III, pp. 1062–1065.</note> wherein Soviets assumed obligation for transit traffic to and from Berlin. It now purports unilaterally to divest itself of obligation formally assumed and not part of wartime agreements. Secretary also recalled final directive of Summit Meeting of July 1955<note n="9" xml:id="d112fn9"><hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 1955–1957, vol. V, pp. 527–528.</note> in which four powers agreed they had responsibility for solution of German question, a matter always deemed to include problem of Berlin.</p>
<p>In effect, Soviets have said that unless we accept and implement their decision in six months, they will unilaterally carry it out. We are faced with what can only be interpreted as an ultimatum in that respect. U.S. is of opinion that any compromise on this issue would be serious indeed, and it is almost grotesque to suggest that new agreements be negotiated on wreckage of unilateral denunciation by Soviets of whole series of prior agreements. If Soviets can denounce agreements whenever their purpose is served, what is value of new agreements? It would <pb xml:id="pg_212" n="212" facs="0237"/>be of utmost importance therefore that Soviets be given opportunity to qualify reported denunciation of agreements and apparent ultimatum aspect of note as condition precedent to new agreements. We need not put matter in a way difficult for Soviets in this respect, but it does seem that willingness to continue negotiations should be related to explanation by Soviet Union that it not intended unilaterally to denounce this series of existing agreements or place Western powers under threat of ultimatum. Of course, willingness of Western powers to negotiate on subject has been made manifest time and again. Note of Sept. 30<note n="10" xml:id="d112fn10">For text of this note, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> October 20, 1958, pp. 613–614.</note> has not yet received reply. It constitutes invitation to negotiate which still outstanding. Secretary said he did not suggest that offers should be withdrawn, or that there should be refusal by Allies to negotiate on reunification of Germany which is heart of any change in Berlin status.</p>
<p>Secretary said he had no doubt that, before issue resolved, we would be subjected to very severe war of nerves which had already begun. Soviet note of Dec. 13<note n="11" xml:id="d112fn11">See <ref target="#d107fn3">footnote 3, Document 107</ref>.</note>
 contained violent threat that all Europe could be wiped out. This perhaps so, equally so Soviet Union could be wiped out by the U.S. if that attempted. Soviet Union knows this, and since it a fact, he did not think we need worry about these threats. There exists in U.S. a deterrent power which is very great indeed, perhaps greater than it has been or may be, because Soviets are short of long-range bombers and do not yet have in production and in place means adequate to accomplish great results. American military advisers are confident Soviets will not risk war about Berlin, and threat to devastate Europe if West firm on Berlin is an empty one which ought not to frighten anyone. Therefore, we can proceed with confidence and refrain from encouraging bold and reckless Soviet move which, if successful, would only encourage further moves of same kind. Secretary recalled Hitler who initially, probably contrary to military advice, acted recklessly, got away with it, and became more and more reckless until the world was plunged into World War II. In U.S. opinion, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> now faces the world with comparable test. We hope it will be dealt with in a manner which will not encourage further irresponsible moves by Soviets. Peaceful co-existence presupposes sanctity of international agreements. Willingness to proceed with new agreements on basis denunciation of existing agreements would be great weakness and mistake on part of free world.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_213" n="213" facs="0238"/>
<p>Canadian Foreign Minister said that, although Canada not directly responsible in Berlin, it, like other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, was affected by what happened there and saw situation from viewpoint of country which in 1954 had associated itself with tripartite reaffirmation of Berlin guarantee. He agreed Soviet proposals on Berlin were unacceptable, and hoped that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting would say so publicly—as clearly as four Foreign Ministers had on Dec. 14. Only satisfactory solution for Berlin is to make it capital of free and united Germany. Soviet proposals were not only offensive in language, but they were bad history. Nevertheless, he wished to ask question whether this ruled out possibility of some interim arrangement for city as first step to reunification. Were there any counter-proposals re Berlin itself which could be advanced? He hoped four powers would examine possibility in course of deliberations. At some point negotiation with Soviets re German problem and European security was necessary. He hoped this would be reflected in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué and in replies of four powers to Soviet notes.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> said he had no formula to suggest, but felt Western powers should begin with re-evaluation of Western reunification policies. Were there any alternatives? He hoped willingness to negotiate would be preserved and that a tolerable modus vivendi would be sought. Said he was gratified by British <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>’s statement of Dec. 4<note n="12" xml:id="d112fn12">For text of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s statement on Europe in the House of Commons, see 596 House of Commons, <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Debates,</hi> 5th Series, cols. 1368–1382.</note> affirming British readiness to negotiate with Soviets on German problems as well as similar expression of readiness by Secretary. He referred with approval to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s view that if freely elected Government of reunified Germany chose to join <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, no strategic advantage would be taken of Eastern Germany and forces would not be moved forward. Chanceller <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> has several times made same point, <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> continued. This would involve some risk, but risk would not be greater than in present situation. Flexibility shown by these statements must b<hi rend="italic">e</hi> preserved if West is to regain initiative on Berlin.</p>
<p>Danish <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> agreed with main lines of envisaged reply to Soviet proposals. Danes appreciated intentions of three powers to reject Soviet legal position as unfounded while restating Western legal position and making it clear that they were going to maintain it. This, however, Krag continued, did not alter earnest Danish desire and hopes for summit meeting at suitable time to deal with outstanding problems, perhaps including that of European security. He felt any communiqué should reflect this point.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_214" n="214" facs="0239"/>
<p>Belgian <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> made rather lengthy analysis of situation which was partly repetitive of points previously made. He noted that once again Soviets had taken initiative at time and place of their own choosing. This gave them advantage. Western reply must accordingly not merely be repudiation, but also involve taking initiative. Western legal position was strong, but de facto situation in Berlin difficult. Berlin was an isolated city and if Soviets carried out their intentions after six months, Western powers would be faced with concrete situation. On other hand, if they were to leave Berlin, it would quickly be absorbed by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Western powers should adapt their reply to these two facts. They should not make any concessions to Soviet threat, but it would be unwise to refuse negotiations with Soviets simply because we did not believe in their good faith. Public opinion would not accept this. Hence, a strong imaginative effort was necessary that would embarrass Soviets.</p>
<p>Wigny suggested that two possibilities presented themselves— separate treatment of Berlin, or treatment of Berlin problem as part of German problem as whole. He suggested that Soviet proposal of free city might be turned around to their embarrassment by saying that we too are for a free city including all four sectors, to be established on basis free elections accompanied by provisions for firm attachment to that portion of world to which population preferred to remain attached.</p>
<p>Soviets always have advantage because they make proposals in advance they know we will refuse, Wigny continued. We must not simply renew old line, but add to it giving impression of imagination. We might respond that a demilitarized free city should not be within reach of cannons of Soviets, hence, there should be a demilitarization of East Germany, at least beyond Berlin and perhaps including Poland.</p>
<p>Wigny expressed gratification at consultation with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s assurance of future consultation. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries were in this together. It would be preferable that positive reply be sent long before end of six-month period since time must be left for negotiations. West must have firm position right from start of these negotiations. Soviets would attempt to turn tables by making West responsible for aggression by claiming aggression was being committed against East Germany police to whom they had turned over responsibility. It would be better for West to say at beginning of negotiations that any act on part of Soviets or anyone else re Allied corridor to Berlin would be considered an extremely grave act.</p>
<p>Greek <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> stated his support of firm reply, and said he agreed with Fanfani that reply should take up propaganda threat and try to embarrass Soviets. Greek Govt had impression Soviet objective re Berlin did not involve readiness to go to war, but was intended to cover up dangerous maneuvers elsewhere. Infiltration was going on in other large areas of world and periodic crises were created to make Western <pb xml:id="pg_215" n="215" facs="0240"/>countries lose sight of these developments elsewhere. West should be firm on Berlin, but not forget this basic fact. Soviets were clever in their tactics. By repeating threats and making excessive demands, they made Western public opinion willing to accept with relief solution which conceded something to Soviets. We are asked for one thousand, Averoff said. Public opinion gets frightened and if we agree to one hundred, there is great relief.</p>
<p>Netherlands <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> made strong statement. He said he agreed Soviet proposals were unacceptable and West must be resolved to remain in Berlin and protect its population. It should be made clear that if Soviets put proposed measures into effect this may lead to military measures necessary to supply Allied garrisons. Should also make clear that unilateral action not acceptable and that change can only be made by negotiation, but such negotiations could not be on basis of present Soviet proposals. Soviets were trying to put Western determination to test.</p>
<p>Position of West, Luns continued, would however be improved if we declared willingness to discuss whole German question. Such a conference perhaps in March might provide occasion for informal discussions on most urgent problem of how to avoid incidents if Soviets withdraw. He recognized that Soviets had said they would not discuss problem of German unification with other three powers. If they continue to refuse, blame can clearly be put on them. Soviet tactics are aimed not at reaching agreement, but at exhibiting weaknesses in Western public opinion forcing Governments to press for dangerous concessions such as formal recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He referred to “disengagement virus,” and said establishment of neutral zones would only create more political danger and more possibility of miscalculation. It should therefore be made clear to public opinion that Soviet Berlin initiative forms part of effort to neutralize West Germany, to confederate West and East Germany, to spread Communism in West Europe, and to demolish Western defensive system.</p>
<p>British <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said that Soviet action was part of pattern of attack on Western positions everywhere. Concessions do not make us safer, and West must be firm. He welcomed U.S. Government statement that U.S. Governement makes it absolutely clear that full force of nuclear deterrent would be used if Soviets attempted to alter status quo by force. Most people know the chances of survival for a free city of Berlin were nil. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> was glad to find unity which existed among <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries for firm refutation of Soviet proposals. He hoped that from this unity they might gain stength to deal with other matters where disagreement still existed.</p>
<p>With firmness must be linked constructive approach to German problem as a whole. Berlin should be capital of a free and united Germany. This point must be repeated. Another attempt must be made to <pb xml:id="pg_216" n="216" facs="0241"/>convince people that these proposals offer a sound basis for European security and they must be re-examined to see if they could not be better put. People are a little tired of our old proposals. There must be flexibility in tactics but absolute firmness on principles in dealing with Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was a skilled tactician and manipulator of public opinion. West needed to strengthen its position before public opinion. He thought one of strongest points for West to make was that Soviets were repudiating their pledged word and to stress what effect this would have on other negotiations with Soviet Union. We might do this more in sorrow than in anger. Even <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might be susceptible to argument that Soviets are unreliable and do not keep their pledged word.</p>
<p>Norwegian <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> also supported rejection of unilateral denunciation of international agreements. Re formulation of replies to Soviet notes by four powers, Lange agreed that views should be presented in such a way as to convince public opinion. 1955 proposals were reasonable, but it must be frankly admitted that success had not been achieved in having them accepted by public. Consideration should accordingly be given to possible revision of certain of these proposals. It was not possible to wait until expiration of six-months period before efforts were made to influence public opinion on this serious matter.</p>
<p>Turkish <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said this was obviously fresh Soviet attempt to strain Atlantic Alliance, dissolution of which principal goal since it is primary obstacle to world domination which Soviets seek. Re Western reaction, Zorlu continued, stress should be laid on importance of all-German factors in settlement of Berlin problem. Goals of unification of Germany and security of Europe were basis of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> policy and no solution was acceptable which ran counter to these objectives. West must avoid anything which weakens Alliance. Task of West was to face up to problem with solidarity.</p>
<p>Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>, in Chair, asked Foreign Ministers whether attempt should be made to draft communiqué to be issued same evening. Agreement was general that effort should be made. Agreement also reached that verbatim record of meeting should be circulated by International Staff.</p>
<p>After noting that Ministers had evidenced large measure of agreement not only in principle but even in details, <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> reviewed in some detail points arising out of Council discussion which he considered should be reflected in communiqué. Special working group made up of UK, France, U.S., <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>, Italy, Canada, chaired by Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs, met shortly after end of morning session to prepare draft.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_217" n="217" facs="0242"/>
<p>At 17:30 hours, Ministers examined product of drafting group, and after reworking for some two hours agreed on text at 19:30 hours for immediate release (text in separate message).<note n="13" xml:id="d112fn13"><gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 1717 from Paris, December 17.

<p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>We have just finished our first day of formal <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meetings, morning and afternoon. These were devoted almost exclusively to Berlin. The atmosphere on the whole was good. I made a statement which seems to have been well received.<note n="1" xml:id="d113fn1">See <ref target="#d112fn5">footnote 5, Document 112</ref>.</note> I emphasized with a map the area which the forces under your command gave up to the Soviets in order to comply with the 1944 agreement which the Soviets now denounce. Most of the statements made were strong and vigorous, the only exception being the Canadians who were rather soft. Most of the afternoon session was devoted to drawing up a communiqué on Berlin.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">For text of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> declaration on Berlin, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> January 5, 1959, p. 4.</note> You can well imagine that this was a rather harrowing experience with each one of the fifteen foreign ministers doing an editing job.

<p>The French Foreign Minister said that we should now proceed to the drafting of our reply to the Soviets. The Secretary said that he had a draft now based on the French draft which had been expanded to add certain material regarding the historical events of 1939.<note n="1" xml:id="d114fn1">Neither draft has been further identified.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that the Working Group was meeting this afternoon. It was proposed to work until December 24 and then recess for about a week, and have a draft the first week in January. The Secretary said he had no objection to proceeding sooner. He added there was some difference of opinion as to whether the reply should be delivered before or after the Communist Party meeting in January. He personally believed that to wait until the latter part of January to deliver our reply would give the impression of vacillation on our part. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said French public opinion would not understand a long delay in replying, and he thought the Germans felt the same way. He thought we should make known our firm position promptly. The Secretary agreed and said he thought we should go ahead, and have a draft by the end of the year.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">M. Couve de Murville</persName> referred to the discussions of last Sunday,<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">December 14; see <ref target="#d108">Documents 108</ref> and <ref target="#d109">109</ref>.</note> and asked for a further explanation of our ideas with regard to access to Berlin. The Secretary explained that at present our road convoys normally go through without armor. If <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> agents were to take over and <pb xml:id="pg_219" n="219" facs="0244"/>were to stop these convoys, our thought was to have them go back, and then attempt to go through again with a certain amount of armor. They would not attempt at this point to force their way through as we don’t have sufficient [armor] for that, but would serve to test the Soviets fully. If convoys were stopped under these circumstances, we would then consult again and reconsider courses of action such as adding additional armor, an air lift, etc. The purpose of our Point D<note n="3" xml:id="d114fn3">See <ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>.</note> was to make a show of force to see if the Soviets were prepared to meet force with force. We would not initially establish a self-blockade which might prove to be unnecessary. An air lift was not automatically the answer either.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he presumed that if <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> agents replaced the Soviets in the <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>, our civilian aircraft would ignore them and fly in anyway. Under these conditions, these planes would probably be interfered with. In that case we could supply them with military escort and force the Soviets to take the first overt action. The Secretary said we of course wished to maneuver the Soviets into shooting first. Our Point D was intended to test the Soviet intentions and not lead to fighting.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked what percentage of our Berlin traffic involved road transport, since virtually all of the French traffic was by rail. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said we used both rail and road while the British used virtually all road traffic. The test of the Soviets’ intentions would of course come through our utilization of road traffic and not rail.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that he was convinced these actions will not lead to war, since the Soviets do not wish a war. They are in a period of relative weakness, and are between the bomber phase and the missile phase. They have economized and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> recently stated they had ceased bomber production while they had an inadequate supply of missiles at present. The Secretary added that, if we made a show of force, we would probably get through. He did not want to have a self-imposed blockade unless the Soviets resisted a show of force, in which case we would want to consider the situation again.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked if discussions on these points would be held in Bonn. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that we thought discussions on Point D should be held in Washington, to which <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> expressed no objection. Since Points B and C were agreed, the detailed implementing instructions could now be sent to Bonn. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he personally had not previously known about the contingency planning for Berlin. The Secretary said this had been agreed in 1954 and confirmed in 1957 but that he personally had not previously been involved in this subject either.</p>

<p>[Here follows a description of other activities.]</p>
<p>Looking back on this past week in Paris, I consider it a great success. At the tripartite meeting,<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">See <ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note> the United States, France and the U.K. agreed to revise the contingency orders to avoid any recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. This resulted from a position taken in Washington with the approval of the National Security Council and President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. At the same meeting, it was agreed that the question of the military reaction to any Soviet or East German move regarding Berlin would be further discussed between the Governments. The Ambassadors in Bonn of the three powers were instructed together with their military advisers to work out new access procedures. The feeling was unanimous not to accept the substitution for Soviet authority of that asserted by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>At the Council meeting,<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3">See <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’s pronouncement of American readiness, if necessary, to resort to a general war in the face of aggression, had a tremendous effect. We can now continue our policy toward Berlin with the unanimous backing of our European allies.</p>

(Topping considers Sutulov to be <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> official in Berlin responsible for contact with West press and for conveyance, when <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s desire, of their point of view to Allied officials through West correspondents.) On Sutulov’s initiative, Topping and Sutulov repaired to local cafe so that discussion could be held in relaxed and private atmosphere.</p>
<p>Sutulov stated <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be so busy preparing for Party Congress to be held Moscow end of Jan that in absence of urgency now unforeseen <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> not expected visit East Berlin in Jan.</p>
<p>Sutulov then raised <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s forthcoming visit to U.S.<note n="1" xml:id="d116fn1">Documentation on <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s visit to the United States, January 4–20, 1959, is presented in volume X.

<p>Sutulov said <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> would be prepared to discuss whole range of subjects, not just economic matters. He said specific information not available to him as to just what subjects <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> would be prepared to discuss, but <gloss target="#t_SovEmb1">SovEmb</gloss> understood <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> would be prepared to discuss Berlin question if Pres <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> or <gloss target="#t_SecState1">SecState</gloss> were to raise subject with <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and “show positive interest.” Sutulov added that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Gov attaches highest importance to <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> visit. (Topping filed <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> story evening Dec 20 on <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> visit.) Topping saw Sutulov again on Dec 22. Sutulov indicated that Berlin is <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s principal reason for going to Washington.</p>
<p>Without prompting Sutulov also brought up <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>’s statement (<gloss target="#t_ourtel1">ourtel</gloss> 445 to Bonn, 501 to Dept)<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">Telegram 445, December 20, reported that in an interview with the East German wire service General <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> had attacked the Western response to the Soviet proposals on Berlin, stating that Western military leaders, and General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> in particular, had attempted to create a war psychosis out of the Berlin question.

Topping replied he could not understand why <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName> chose to make such a statement when situation already so tense.</p>
<p>Sutulov replied that <persName corresp="#p_XMGNF1">Zakharov</persName>’s statement was in reply to Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>’ statement made in Berlin on Nov 30 (<gloss target="#t_ourtel1">ourtel</gloss> 381 to Bonn, 432 to Dept).<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">Telegram 381, December 1, transmitted a summary of the Berlin press coverage for November 30 and December 1 including <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ meeting with <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> at Augusta, Georgia, and <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>’ press conference in Berlin on November 30. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/12–158)</note> Sutulov said it was one thing for political figures, even including <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, to make statement such as <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> had made—<gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s expect this sort of thing—but “when a senior and responsible US military <pb xml:id="pg_222" n="222" facs="0247"/>person who holds the weapons in his hands makes such a statement it becomes matter of great concern and danger to us”.</p>
<p>Topping replied that <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> had made no belligerent statements. <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> had told press he had come to Berlin to make no statement but to make routine visit and attend football game. He met with press only at latter’s insistence.</p>
<p>Sutulov said that of course <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s had to rely on West Berlin press accounts of <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName>’ interview, wherein it stated that <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> had secret plans re Berlin. (<hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USBER1">USBer</gloss> comment:</hi> <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> answered press questions in calm and circumspect manner. Certain correspondents including some from West Berlin press chose to report certain remarks out of context— as they have on other occasions.

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 962A.61/12–2258)</note> Topping replied that <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> had been asked the question “Do you have plans for contingencies?” and Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> had replied “Yes, as a general it is my job to have plans for every conceivable contingency”. This, Topping observed to Sutulov, was only reply <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> could give.</p>
<p>Sutulov next raised the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> statement and said that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s were incensed because of its negative nature, failure to make counterproposal, issuance before Allied replies to <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> note, and because Berlin was none of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s business anyway.</p>
<p>Topping has following impressions as result of talk with Sutulov:</p>

Sutulov reiterated that the Soviet note was not an ultimatum, and further discussion revealed his “obvious concern” that the Allies might use force.

<p>Arrived in Berlin. Rainy day. Office almost deserted. Had talk there with <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>—he and I see eye to eye on the local problems, and on what U.S. policy ought to be—and we hope is—in respect to them.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_WRG1">Rebecca Wellington</persName> and I motored over to the East Sector—“flying the flag” it is called. Why American Ambassadors sport two flags, a national and a diplomatic one, is unknown to me. So far as I have observed, this is not done by Ambassadors from other countries, and it seems a bit pretentious. East Berlin looked as dreary as ever, and the banal Stalinallee buildings dull as ditchwater. The people are, we are told, healthy and well-fed, but they must be unspeakably bored with their drab lives.</p>
<p>Back on glowing Kurfurstendamm, we stopped at the Hilton to sample the bar, then to lunch at home. Most of the houses in West Berlin are decked out with wreaths, and Christmas trees abound—in the East one saw nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>This afternoon, Cort Schuyler and Ham<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">General Cortlandt Van Rennsselaer Schuyler, Chief of Staff, <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>, and General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>.</note> came to see me. We talked of how to defend our position in Berlin, without engaging in general war except as a last resort. <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> has certain ideas, and Cort wants me to talk to <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> about them. Ham and I are not in favor of mere probing operations on the ground, as has been sometimes suggested. A few rails pulled on the tracks, a couple of bridges blown on the autobahn, would immobilize our military trains and convoys, and make us ridiculous, unless we were prepared to keep the routes open by the employment of substantial forces. Ham and I think, if the Soviets turn over checkpoint control to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, we ought at once to move a souped-up division to Helmstedt, to show we really mean business. As always, one must reckon with the British and the French, who are much less inclined to a tough policy than ourselves, though they have gone along nicely on the change in standing orders. Under certain circumstances, we might have to act unilaterally, in view of our much larger capabilities and the far greater expectations entertained of us by Berliners and West Germans, but I fervently hope we will not have to do so.</p>

<p>The quadripartite working group began discussion of the draft reply to the Soviet note of November 27 at the Quai d’Orsay on December 17 with <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Loftus E. Becker</persName>, Legal Adviser of the Department of State; <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Martin J. Hillenbrand</persName>, Director of the Office of German Affairs; and <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Walter J. Stoessel, Jr.</persName>, representing the United States. The following day drafts of each country’s reply had been prepared and were referred to the four countries for consideration. A variety of changes were made in the individual drafts, and on December 29 they were all discussed by the North Atlantic Council. Following a few last minute revisions the three Western replies were delivered to the Soviet Foreign Ministry the afternoon of December 31. The West German reply was delivered 5 days later on January 5, 1959.</p>

</list>
<p>The British Minister, <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Lord Hood</persName>, called today at his request to ascertain, as he said, whether we had any thoughts as to where we go next on Point D of the American proposals for the revision of Berlin contingency plans.<note n="2" xml:id="d119fn2">Reference is to point D of <ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>.</note> He noted that he had a preview of the British position and it was not the same as that of the United States. Military advisers were on their way from Germany by air and would be arriving in Washington tonight. This raised the question of whether British and American representatives should get together again tomorrow bilaterally before the talks on Monday with the French begin. If so, it would be probably advisable to include some representatives from the Pentagon.</p>
<p>He went on to say that the British feel doubts about Point D on two grounds. As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> has told the British Ambassador the other <pb xml:id="pg_226" n="226" facs="0251"/>night, the British understood that the United States preferred a land demonstration because it brought the issue to a head in a fashion that “could not be fudged”, i.e., in a way that would really test Soviet intentions. London on the other hand, felt it to be a mistake in the cold war type of exercise involved to put your opponent immediately up to the stark choice of war or surrender, and it would be a surrender if the Soviets permitted United States tanks to go through. London preferred not to bring the issue to a head at such an early stage.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> commented that the only alternative to not bringing it to a head at this stage was either to impose a blockade on oneself or to accept <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> substitution for the Soviets at the check points, which the Allies agreed they would not do. To delay only ran the risk of bringing on a total blockade of the City. It was more or less accepted that an airlift covering the needs of the entire City was not possible now, as it had been in 1948. Hence, a blockade would quickly bring economic strangulation and panic to Berlin. We may realistically assume that the Soviets will probably be aware, at least in general, of the contingency instructions issued to our people in Berlin. Any impression that we are soft would merely encourage them to take the action which we must avoid. He, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, was convinced that the best way to avoid the risk of war is to determine in advance that we are prepared to accept it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> added that unless we are prepared to do this at the first test the risk of war would, in his opinion, be enhanced a great deal.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Lord Hood</persName> said that we obviously must think this through. It was not in London’s mind to accept a blockade. We could resort to an airlift and suspend land operations temporarily. This would give time to see what would develop and what should be our best move. After all, our objective in any event is to get the Soviets to a conference and to have some negotiations on Germany as a whole. If five tanks were to get through that would not prove anything. We would be faced with the same problem every day.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> commented that we envisaged that a conference would come precisely out of this situation. We would welcome such a conference which would give the Soviets a chance privately to get off the hook. He was troubled by what the British were saying.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Lord Hood</persName> then added that the second British objection to Point D was that the Western Powers should not embark on a land probe unless prepared to push it through to its logical consequences. We could not simply draw back. As the American military people had explained to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DASM1">Denny</persName>, the first test would be made say by five tanks. If this failed, then a tank battalion would take over. If this were stopped, then the Allies must issue what amounted to an ultimatum. This would require the taking of many preliminary measures before the action could go ahead. He noted that the American military were in a higher state of <pb xml:id="pg_227" n="227" facs="0252"/>readiness than the British. Moreover, all of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies were involved, and the British wondered whether they would be willing to go to these lengths.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> added that there seemed to be some confusion about the time element. We were talking about what would happen if a conference with the Soviets failed. Our position in Point D was implicit in what had been agreed in Paris. We had given much thought to this situation at first when the details of our own position were still unformulated. We had arrived at the conclusion that this decision was inevitable once peaceful settlement procedures had been exhausted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> said the American position seemed to assume that no solutions would be available once the Soviets had turned over their controls at the check points to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> representatives.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> commented that we were over the cliff already if we could not get tripartite agreement to react when the Soviets applied force to get us out of Berlin. The sooner we knew we could not reach such a decision the better. <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Lord Hood</persName> said he did not know the processes of reasoning which had led London to come to its conclusions, if they could be called conclusions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he had had an opportunity in Paris to talk to the British Foreign Minister,<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">Not further identified.</note> who expressed concern over it being clearly established who fired the first shot on the confused situation on the Autobahn. He had made the point that, if an unarmed transport were shot down in the air corridor, the whole world would know who was the aggressor. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that, if we reviewed the statements already made, one would have to come to the conclusion that a public announcement had been made of a decision not completely taken. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> added that it was implicit in our entire posture to say that we would fight to stay in Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Lord Hood</persName> commented that we were really not faced by this problem at the present time since the garrisons could be supplied by air. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> said that it appeared the only real difference between us and the British was that they felt we could still negotiate if we once got to the point where the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> took over, whereas the United States seemed to feel that the negotiating possibilities would then be exhausted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that if, in five months, we were unsuccessful in getting the Soviets to change their position how could negotiations at this point have any chance of being successful. <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Lord Hood</persName> agreed this was cogent, but asked what it was hoped to accomplish then. Did we really believe the American convoy would be permitted to pass through? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that we hoped and sincerely expected that, if our firmness was communicated to the Soviets privately, they would never turn their controls over to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The <pb xml:id="pg_228" n="228" facs="0253"/>more confused and divided we were on this point the greater the danger every single day.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Lord Hood</persName> asked whether we were really not in the same position if we supplied ourselves by air. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said we would have surrendered a right, and an extension of the blockade to the civil population would probably be inevitable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> added that, at that point, we would still have to come back to the same decision under the most painful of circumstances. <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Lord Hood</persName> said the difficulty is in finding a method of challenge to the Soviets which is likely to produce the desired result of changing their position.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> raised the possibility that the Soviets might not wait five months, but turn over to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> within the next two or three weeks. In that event the land operation would not be preceded by talks with the Soviets. To this Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> responded that one must assume the Soviets are generally familiar with the nature of present instructions in Germany. If they were aware of what was said on the subject in Paris they would actually have an increased incentive to enter into negotiations. Agreement on Point D was therefore an essential first step in getting to negotiations. If we are to leave this issue undecided until April or May, the risk would greatly be increased. If war comes, he was convinced, it would involve a miscalculation, not a deliberate choice. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> added that we must make a decision now so that the chance of negotiations would be increased. We really could not effectively deal with the situation unless a decision were made first.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Lord Hood</persName> said this was obviously a big decision with grave consequences. The Soviets undoubtedly hoped for a disunited Western response. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> noted that the Paris meetings with their firm display of resolution were probably a surprise to the Soviets. It was agreed that a further discussion of Point D with the British would take place on January 3 with military representatives present on both sides.</p>

</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> opened the meeting by stating that the British wished to “probe our thinking” regarding paragraph D of the aide-mémoire of December 11, 1958,<note n="1" xml:id="d120fn1">See <ref target="#d98fn5">Document 98 and footnote 5</ref> thereto.</note> which deals with the use of limited military force in connection with Berlin access. He said that the British saw the situation as follows: The starting point is our intention, as reflected in Allied declarations, to maintain our position in Berlin and our access to Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has resorted to “brinksmanship” on Berlin, and our only response can be to stand firm. Firmness means that all our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies must see eye-to-eye on the problem, and an important aspect of the Soviet action was probably the attempt to sow mistrust within the Western alliance. The need for solidarity among the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers plus considerations of public opinion in our own countries require that our policy avoid giving the impression that we, rather than the Soviets, are provoking trouble. “The Russians must fire the first shot.” The British follow American thinking on paragraphs A, B, and C of the aide-mémoire, but they would like to know how the U.S. contemplates events will develop under circumstances in which we would invoke paragraph D and resort to the use of limited military force.</p>
<p>In reply, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> summarized the American position as follows: In reviewing our Berlin contingency planning, we soon realized that we had to demonstrate our readiness to fight in the last resort to maintain <pb xml:id="pg_230" n="230" facs="0255"/>our access to Berlin by road and that we could not intelligently develop a tactical response to the Soviet threat unless we faced up to this question. We wish to bring the USSR to negotiations and we wish to exhaust all peaceful remedies. But we are in a better position if we can say, for example to <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>, that the Soviets are challenging a vital American interest which we are prepared, if necessary, to maintain by force. We wish to leave no room for the Soviets to misunderstand our intentions. Unless we are prepared to do so, we have in effect publicly announced a policy with respect to Berlin, e.g. in the Berlin declarations, without actually having adopted such a policy.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> added that the basic decision we must take is to face up to the problem “at the first turn of the screw”. We should try to avoid “firing the first shot”, but there will be a point at which we shall have to take action.</p>
<p>In response to the question what specific steps were envisaged, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> mentioned the possibility of using force to extricate a convoy which was not allowed to proceed because the commander refused to show documentation to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials. General <persName corresp="#p_JMGDV1">Johnson</persName> added that the questions how one uses force and how much force is needed were a matter for the determination of the field commander. It might, however, be necessary to have a series of tests of Soviet intentions, depending on Soviet reactions to varying actions on our part. We might ultimately have to be prepared to increase our effort, always trying, if possible, to avoid shooting or at least to avoid firing the first shot. In response to <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName>’s question whether we would be prepared ultimately to take over complete control of the Autobahn, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> said that he hoped this would not be necessary. He also thought that there was a point at which the Soviets would prevent us from ensuring our ability to pass, but that the first convoy might get through.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> explained that the American position was that we should probably not reach the point where we have to take additional military action. Our proposed course of action involves the readiness ultimately to go to war, but we would have a few months in which to try to find a way to permit the Soviets to back down.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> said that two questions arose from the foregoing discussion. First, how do we put the matter to the Soviets; and second, what measures of preparedness should we take. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> replied that we contemplated “non-provocative” military preparedness measures, and General <persName corresp="#p_JMGDV1">Johnson</persName> amplified this statement by saying that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> is preparing a list of steps which might be taken to improve our readiness. General <persName corresp="#p_JMGDV1">Johnson</persName> speculated that we might wish to take such measures as cancelling announced force reductions, increasing draft <pb xml:id="pg_231" n="231" facs="0256"/>calls, increasing the flow of replacements to Europe, evacuating dependents, and stopping tourist travel.</p>
<p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DASM1">Denny</persName> expressed the view that “non-provocative” steps take time to have effect, and said that we would need to take other measures if we want “firm action at the first turn of the screw”. He mentioned the possibility of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> “general alert”, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> replied that a “general alert” would be too precipitate an action and might create greater risks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> expressed a preference for lesser steps which would put us in a better posture for a “general alert” at a later juncture. <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> inquired whether it was contemplated that there would be a series of preparedness measures (e.g. evacuation of dependents) in advance of any military operation, however limited, but this question remained unanswered. It was agreed that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-wide coordination would be required in any case.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> said that the British were of the opinion that there were other means of probing Soviet intentions, for example by setting up a “garrison airlift” rather than making use of limited military force on the road. He thought a “garrison airlift” would be an equally effective demonstration of our intention to maintain access to Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> responded that a “garrison airlift” might seem to be only an evasion of the real problem and that the result would be that we should eventually have to face the test of force in worse circumstances. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> also expressed opposition to an airlift.</p>
<p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DASM1">Denny</persName> declared that an airlift offered additional advantages as a test of Soviet intentions. First, an airlift would give us time to get physically ready for a test of force; and second, an airlift would make it necessary for the Soviets to precipitate the crisis by making the initial use of force.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied that a Soviet “attack” to which we would have to reply would not necessarily involve shooting. The Soviets would, in effect, “pull the trigger” by withdrawing from their obligations regarding our surface access. General <persName corresp="#p_JMGDV1">Johnson</persName> added that an airlift amounted to “accepting the blockade” and that the Soviets would not take our determination to maintain our access seriously.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> expressed a preference for a “garrison airlift” as a “first gambit”, because it would maintain access but would at the same time be a peaceful action. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DASM1">Denny</persName> added that the air route would also be a much more certain route for supplying the Berlin forces, for the road could not be held open by force. Furthermore, in Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DASM1">Denny</persName>’s opinion, a “garrison airlift” had the advantage that it would not be interrupted, as could surface access, by “passive force” on the part of the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> reiterated his belief that one could not <pb xml:id="pg_232" n="232" facs="0257"/>establish surface access by using armed convoys and that a “garrison airlift” was preferable.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reiterated the view that an airlift would be a “measure of surrender” and said that, since we would have to face a show-down some day, the only solution would come from being willing to face it now.</p>
<p>In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName>’s question whether the British looked upon the “garrison airlift” as postponing a crisis or as providing a casus belli in the event of Soviet interference, <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> said the British had both factors in mind. The shooting down of an airplane could, he thought, be regarded as a clear casus belli. Mr. Barker stressed the point that the Soviets might not have to resort to force to stop an armed convoy and that they could create a situation in which we might use force in a manner which would have a bad effect on public opinion. In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName>’s question what measures the British contemplated if an airlift proved not to be feasible, <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> said that he didn’t know and that the problem did not present itself since it has been concluded that a garrison airlift was practicable.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> then stressed the importance of military readiness measures. He said that he hoped the coming discussions would lead to concrete agreements on the preparatory measures to be taken before resorting to limited force, for we must be in a position to see a test of strength.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied that what would be involved would be a “test of will”, not a “test of strength”, for we know that it is not militarily feasible to maintain Berlin or access to Berlin by force. General <persName corresp="#p_JMGDV1">Johnson</persName> added that a test could in any case be deferred, for the Berlin garrisons could hold out for three months without any airlift. One might wait a week or a month.</p>
<p>Our planning, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> explained, was based on the assumption we would not have to resort to a test of force if we are ready for one. We assume that the Soviets do not want war. The way out is to put an “escape hatch” in our notes to the Soviets, but they will not look for this “escape hatch” unless we force them to.</p>
<p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DASM1">Denny</persName> summarized by saying that we must persuade the Soviets of our intentions not only by our statements but also by our physical military posture.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> concluded that the basic issue was whether a probe of Soviet intentions was to be made on land or in the air.</p>

<p>[Here follow 1-1/2 pages of introductory remarks.]</p>
<p>With regard to Germany, the Secretary continued, we recognize that it is a serious problem. We have been twice at war with Germany and although they had not been as costly to us as to the Soviet Union, these wars had been costly and unpleasant affairs for us. We understand quite well the desire of the Soviet Union that Germany should not again become a military menace and share its feelings on the question as what to do to prevent it from becoming that. The danger in the situation arises from the fact that the Soviet Union has one solution and we have another. <note n="1" xml:id="d121fn1">At this point in the source text the sentence, “Neither will work.” was crossed out.</note> Out of our differences, there may emerge another dangerous Germany. These are the kind of things that might be useful to arrange for another talk of perhaps several hours duration while Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> is here.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that he was available, if the Secretary were so disposed, and that further conversation could be held either now or at a later date. In answer to the Secretary’s question as to whether or not he were leaving town tomorrow, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that he was a man on holiday and that it would be easy for him to adjust his plans for the Secretary’s convenience. He could talk tomorrow all day, or some other day. The Secretary said that it would be better to plan further talks when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> came back from his trip. He said that the President would like to talk to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> as well.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_234" n="234" facs="0259"/>
<p>[Here follows a paragraph discussing international communism.]</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> turned to the German problem, which he agreed was a very serious one. He said there was no point in analyzing how the problem began or who was to blame. This would lead to no useful purpose. The Soviet Government thought that the United States had acted wrongly in arming Germany and in bringing it into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The United States perhaps thought the same thing about Soviet action in East Germany. He said that we should leave the past to history and deal with the situation in Germany as it is. There is a West German state and an East German state and a Berlin occupied by the Allies. The Soviets recognized all these facts, the United States only part of them. The latter denied the fact of the existence of the German Democratic Republic. This attitude of the United States did not interfere with the fact. It might even be a source of strength for the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The East Germans had been behind in their living standards but these were now improving and there was a great consolidation of social forces taking place in East Germany. It was not only the Communists who supported the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> but also <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> Democrats and Liberals. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that American views of the situation were wrong and they led to errors in policy. The Soviet Union could not demand the liquidation of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_GFR1">GFR</gloss>. On the contrary, it recognized them. But <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> demanded, and the United States supported this demand, that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> should not be recognized, but, on the contrary, that it should be engulfed by West Germany. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> wanted no other kind of unity but engulfment. That was the problem. The important thing was that there was a strong <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and also that Soviet troops were there. The Secretary asked him to repeat this latter remark, which he did. The Soviet Union was allied with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, he said, through the Warsaw Pact, as the United States was with West Germany in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Due to the <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> policy, the reunification of Germany has been postponed for an indefinite period. The Soviets thought that it was necessary to recognize the facts and take them into account. The Soviet view was that a peace treaty should be signed and if it were, the danger of war would be diminished. What had happened? The Czechs and the Poles had been our allies in the last war but today the <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> government did not even recognize them. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> may not like <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> or East Germany but what right does he have not to recognize Czechoslovakia or Poland? <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said he had told <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> this in a frank talk with him.<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">Presumably this talk took place during <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s state visit to Bonn April 23–26, 1958.</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said he told <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> that it was not in German interests to have no relations with Poland and Czechoslovakia. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had told him that he was thinking of recognizing the government of these <pb xml:id="pg_235" n="235" facs="0260"/>countries, but that he was afraid that the Russians would be opposed. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> replied to him that they only welcomed this. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said that he would do it. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> kept silent during the course of this conversation, but that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had been firm about taking this step. However, following the talk, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had made a statement about the frontier. It was true that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had said that any change in the frontier should occur through peaceful processes, but still he had called for a change. He should understand that he cannot change the frontier by peaceful means. It should be clear that the Poles and the Czechs (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) would never agree to any change. Any talk about changing the frontier would lead to dangerous consequences. It alarmed the Poles and the Czechs, rallied them together and increased anti-American feeling. If a peace treaty were concluded, it would fix the frontier and no one would dare to talk about change. A peace treaty would weaken these disruptive influences.</p>
<p>The Secretary asked whether it should be understood that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> was talking about a peace treaty with two Germanies, without any preliminary union.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> replied affirmatively, saying that he believed there could be a peace treaty without reunification, although it would be preferable to have prior reunification. The leaders of West Germany, he went on, say that there should either be full unity or none. Full unity was unrealistic. Union on the basis of confederation was realistic. He said that while the Secretary knew the history of the United States better than he did, it was his impression that there had been a time when unity of government had been achieved on the basis of confederation. The same had been the case in the USSR. From 1919 to 1924 the relations between the various republics had been based on confederation. Any simple merger in Germany raised the question as to what would happen to the two differing social systems. The German workers in East Germany would defend the socialist system. Also the workers of West Germany stand for nationalization. In any such merger there would be great complications. While the establishment of a confederation would make possible the retention of the social systems existing in the two parts, there would be certain common functions. These common functions would grow and develop a feeling of confidence. Now there not only was no confidence but not even any relations between the two parts of Germany.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that just before he left Moscow, the Soviet Government had been discussing the question of proposing to the other allies the drafting of a peace treaty for Germany. It intended to suggest the calling of a peace conference in two months and would present a draft treaty. It would be glad to have proposals from the United States or any amendments to its proposals. The Soviet Government would seek with all the means at its disposal to move ahead on this. It regarded it as a <pb xml:id="pg_236" n="236" facs="0261"/>peaceful step and would be very persistent. The time had come to put an end to the remnants of war. If we waited on reunification which would be a drawn-out business, we would have to wait to put an end to the consequences of war. The Soviet Government regarded the provisions of the draft treaty proposed by it as being normal and acceptable. There was nothing communistic about this. The Soviet Government regarded as a very important point the question as to what was to be done with the foreign troops in Germany after the peace treaty. It favored withdrawal in a short time. If it were not being realistic about the matter and the United States were not prepared for this, it was the Soviet desire to reach a common policy and it would be prepared to seek alternative solutions. One of these might be to have one-third of the foreign troops withdrawn within six months after the conclusion of a peace treaty and to leave the question of full withdrawal and the dates concerned for decision in the future. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that he had an aide-mémoire on the question which he would be glad to leave with the Secretary.<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">Not printed. The aide-mémoire contained the outline of a treaty of peace with Germany and a reiteration of the Soviet proposal for making Berlin into a free city. (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_WAC1">Whitman</persName> File, Miscellaneous Material) On January 7 the Soviet Ambassador in France presented <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> with a copy of the aide-mémoire. (Telegram 2467 from Paris, January 8; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/1–859) Presumably the British received a copy from the Soviet Ambassador in London. The substance of the document was conveyed to the North Atlantic Council at a special private meeting on January 8. (<gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 1887 from Paris, January 8; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 033.6111/1–859) For text of the draft German peace treaty, dated January 10 and released to the press by the Soviet Union that day, incorporating the ideas presented in the aide-mémoire, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> March 9, 1959, pp. 333–343.</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> then suggested that the Secretary might be interested in the question of Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that before his departure from Moscow, the US note on Berlin<note n="4" xml:id="d121fn4">For text of the U.S. note on Berlin, December 31, 1958, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., January 19, 1959, pp. 79–81, or <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985,</hi> pp. 573–576.</note> had been received. It would be discussed by the Soviet Government and a reply sent. His first impression was that the United States either did not understand the Soviet position or for the benefit of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> or someone else it had presented this position in a distorted manner. The positive side of the note is what the Soviets understand as our desire to have negotiations. As to the distortion of the Soviet position, it would seem from the note that it was the United States that was fighting for the rights of the citizens of West Berlin and the Soviet Union that wanted to suppress them. This was fundamentally wrong. The Soviet Union did not want to extract an advantage from the situation. It did not want to be in a new unequal position, nor did it want to undermine the position of the United States, Britain and France. All the talk about any lack of face which might result from this had no foundation. The Soviet Union wanted the freedom of West Berlin <pb xml:id="pg_237" n="237" facs="0262"/>guaranteed not by the bayonets of occupation forces but by the Four Powers, by the two German States, and by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. It wanted all countries to have free access to Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> repeated that the USSR wanted the guarantee of freedom to be assured by the Four Powers, by the two Germanies, and by other countries and that it was prepared to have the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> participate. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that he wanted to add something that had not been in the other note (the Soviet note of November 27?).<note n="5" xml:id="d121fn5">See <ref target="#d72">Document 72</ref>.</note> The Soviet Union proposed the establishment of a permanent commission composed of the United States, the USSR and others, to guarantee noninterference in the affairs of Berlin.</p>
<p>There had been talk of how West Berlin would survive economically. It would flourish. It would get orders from the United States and the Soviet Union. Everyone would be interested in having West Berlin develop. We could cooperate in protecting West Berlin as a unity not as occupying forces, but on a genuine basis. There had been talk about the Soviet proposal to the effect that it is an ultimatum or a threat. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> did not see the basis for this. The Soviet Union had not threatened military action of any sort. On the contrary, it had proposed negotiations. There had been certain generals who had made threats about tanks being used to break through to Berlin. It was clear that the tanks of one side would be met by the tanks of the other side. Neither side should threaten the other. The Soviet Union did not want war and did not think that the United States wanted war. If we could sit down and discuss the matter calmly, we could make West Berlin a model city with no interference in its internal affairs. What surprised the Soviet Union was that, while it continued to advance positive and constructive proposals, it had met nothing new from the United States. The latter had not even said how long the occupation would last. The fact that the Soviet Union talked about six months—which was long enough for any negotiations on the matter—did not mean that this was an ultimatum or a threat. It was quite natural that the state on whose territory Berlin was situated should carry out such functions.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that he was very glad to have the assurance of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> that the Soviet note was not designed as a threat or ultimatum, otherwise any negotiation would be impossible. With regard to what <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> called the occupation of Berlin, the latter’s picture was not accurate. The fact was that the people of West Berlin looked upon the British, French and US forces as the guarantee of their freedom and independence and not as unfriendly occupation forces. If these troops left, there would surely be serious panic in West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> spoke of making West Berlin a model city. It already was one. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> interrupted <pb xml:id="pg_238" n="238" facs="0263"/>to say “But it is occupied”. The Secretary rejoined that you could call it occupied or defended. He had been in West Berlin in May.<note n="6" xml:id="d121fn6">See <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> He had been impressed by the vigorous vitality of the city, the apartment buildings, and so forth. It was a very fine city today. It was hard to avoid the suspicion that West Berlin was, in fact, too vigorous and prosperous not to invite invidious comparison with its environment. The heart of the matter was that we had agreements which entitled us to maintain certain forces. We would not accept any unilateral determination regarding any withdrawal of forces. No doubt should be left on this score. We were prepared, as our note indicated, to renew discussions on the German question. If agreement seemed possible regarding Germany as a whole, the problem of Berlin would assume a different perspective. We were thus prepared to negotiate about Germany; but the isolated withdrawal of our forces from Berlin was not going to happen. We did not want war over Berlin, nor for that matter, over anything; but we were not prepared to avoid war by retreating wherever we were under pressure.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that no one was asking for withdrawal. The Soviets were proposing the termination of the occupation, not the withdrawal of forces. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> apparently preferred a “tough line” policy and appeared to be trying to inspire himself to resist. The Soviet Government was not asking anyone to withdraw, it was asking for the problem to be settled by negotiation. With regard to unilateral action and terms of agreement, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that he knew the American juridical arguments, but could not agree with them. After all, the Soviet Union had not been asked about the termination of the American occupation in West Germany. On the other hand, it itself was suggesting negotiations before taking any action, which testified to good will on its part.</p>
<p>The Secretary stated that the greatest single obstacle in the present situation was the great doubt that existed in the United States regarding the dependability of Soviet promises. It was difficult to build a better world unless there existed confidence in each other’s promises. He would not expect <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> to agree with us regarding the dependability of Soviet promises but he would ask <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> to agree on the fact that there was a strong feeling about this question in the United States. If there were a real desire on the part of the Soviet Union to develop peaceful relations arid what it calls peaceful coexistence, it would be extremely necessary for the Soviet Union to avoid any actions which would lend credence to the suspicions in this country about the unreliability of its promises. Such topics were not pleasant to raise, but if the <pb xml:id="pg_239" n="239" facs="0264"/>exchange of views were to be beneficial we should treat frankly with the matters that were on our minds.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> nodded, and then said that it was wrong to cast any suspicion on the dependability of Soviet adherence to the agreements it undertakes. The Soviets were realistic and knew the value of good will. There was, however, no use in arguing this point. He was certain that he could find more instances for complaint by their side about nonfulfillment of promises than we could for complaint by us. The best thing was to find one point on which to test dependability, then go on to another, and so forth. Berlin could be taken, as an example. American troops were in West Germany, Soviet troops in East Germany. There could be an international commission set up to test the dependability of an agreement on the Berlin problem. The Soviets realized that if promises were broken here, it would be dangerous, because of the presence of their troops and ours. If there were an international commission, there would be a means for determining this. If, on the other hand, no positive steps were taken, the situation of distrust would continue.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> then pointedly asked the Secretary whether he thought the Soviet Union wanted war. The Secretary said no. Then he asked <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> whether he thought the United States wanted war. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that he did not think the United States wanted war now, but the United States had set up bases around the Soviet Union and this gave ground for suspicion as to what might happen in the future. These bases were not there to play football. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had raised a matter which touched upon the major question of collective security. There could be a talk about this at some other time.</p>
<p>After checking his calendar, the Secretary said that he would make the full day of January 19th available for talks with <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and possibly some time on January 20th. The President of Argentina would arrive on the latter day for a State Visit and thus there was a question of whether any time would be available in the course of that day. The Secretary said he would have to go over his schedule to see whether any time could be arranged for that day as well. During the conversations on January 19, arrangements could be made for <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s call on the President. The Secretary remarked that the talk today had been very useful in helping to prepare our minds for more extensive and substantial talks later on.<note n="7" xml:id="d121fn7">On January 6 <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> discussed U.S.-Soviet relations with Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and with former Presidential Assistant Harold Stassen. In both cases he reiterated the Soviet position on Berlin as developed in his conversation with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. A memorandum of his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is printed in vol. X, Part 1, <ref target="#d61">Document 61</ref>.

<p>After reading and commenting on paragraph D, which he said was quite clear, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> explained that we did not want to make the same mistake we had made at the time of the 1948 blockade. The 1948–49 airlift was, to be sure, a technical success, but it had been very expensive. More important, the airlift had been an evasion of the issue in the face of a Soviet challenge. It had not sufficed to prevent the Korean War, which cost us many casualties.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> inquired whether it was contemplated that we should use force in the first instance or whether we should only answer force <pb xml:id="pg_241" n="241" facs="0266"/>with force. <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> asked what force we contemplated using in the first instance and what force would be held in reserve.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> replied that it is difficult to pin down specifically what we would do. The military field commanders must take such decisions in the light of the circumstances obtaining at the time. If we show determination to resist the first attempt to impede our access, the issue may not arise. The extent of force which would be required would depend on what the Soviets did. What we want to do, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> said, is to take the basic decision here; the implementation can be left to the military in the field.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> added that we simply wanted to state the general principle on which we would operate. We would, he said, be glad to set up a working group for a detailed study of various contingencies, but such a study would take a lot of time.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> referred to the “six months’ notice” which the Soviets have given us and asked what we intended to do in this period, i.e., what action we contemplated first, what action we contemplated on June 1, and what action we contemplated after that. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> asked whether we would consider the turning back of trains and road traffic as force which had to be countered by force.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> referred to various actions which could be taken to impede our access and stated that we would use such force as we determine to be necessary to prosecute our right of access to Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr.<persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> posed the question whether we really need a “statement of principle” as proposed by the United States or whether we could wait for a further clarification of Soviet intentions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that the earlier we took the decision the better, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> added that we have no assurance that the Soviets will not act in less than six months.</p>
<p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName>’s observation that the matter affected all the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> stated that we proposed to consult in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> when our plans are revised but that the tripartite communiqué of December 14<note n="5" xml:id="d122fn5">For text of this communiqué, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents</hi>, 1958, p. 600; <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, p. 559; or Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> December 29, 1958, pp. 1041–1042.</note> and the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué of December 16<note n="6" xml:id="d122fn6">For text of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> declaration on Berlin, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., January 5, 1959, p. 4; <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1958</hi>, pp. 602–603; or <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, p. 560.</note> implicitly authorize us to undertake such planning. We are in a way only implementing a decision already taken, for our public declarations on Berlin imply our readiness to use force if necessary.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_242" n="242" facs="0267"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> expressed the view that we must take further preparatory steps if we wish to show the Soviets that our declarations are not empty words. We must, he said, exhaust all peaceful courses and make it clear that any war which might result would not be of our making. Thus we must make the Soviets face the real alternatives of allowing us to pass or of using force to prevent our passage. The British do not think that the Soviets want war, but if war seems to threaten, popular opinion must not have the impression that the Western Powers have done the provoking. Thus we must explore what is involved in the way of preparations, both psychological and military. First, we must show the Soviets our determination. This could be best accomplished by a general mobilization or by what is comparable, i.e., a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> general alert. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> objected that it would be impossible to make a stand if one described the “horrors of the ultimate” to the people.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> admitted that it was difficult to draw a balance. The basic objective is to maintain access to Berlin, and this, in his opinion, could be done by a variety of methods including a garrison airlift.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> offered a definition of “force” as contemplated in paragraph D. This would, he said, be such force as is necessary to counter active or “passive” force denying us access. There is an unending series of possibilities. If we are determined to use force, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> continued, we will create two situations. First, the Soviets will not make it necessary for us to use it. Second, if the Soviets oppose us, there would result a situation which could lead to war. If the Soviets oppose our first attempt to pass, both sides will build up their forces and will look toward a resolution of the problem by general war if necessary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> concurred with <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> that we must prepare for all eventualities before embarking on the use of force but added that we need a decision on principle before undertaking a discussion of details.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> further defined the United States position by saying that, if our access were challenged in the air, we would respond by the use of limited force in the air. He assumed, however, that the first challenge would come on the ground. In this case it would be preferable to have our road rather than our rail traffic challenged, because it would be easier to respond on the road. The important thing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> concluded, was to test the first challenge of our access.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> inquired whether the principle was now clear, and, if so, whether the British and French would be prepared to explore means of implementing this principle. <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> stated that he accepted the principle but that we need not necessarily respond on the ground. He also observed that the action proposed by the United States involved great risks for which we are not yet prepared.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> replied that an airlift would only amount to a postponement. We will never be in an ideal position for general war, he said, but <pb xml:id="pg_243" n="243" facs="0268"/>we faced this possibility in the Lebanon and Quemoy crises<note n="7" xml:id="d122fn7">Documentation on the landing of U.S. troops in Lebanon on July 15, 1958, is in volume XI. Documentation on the bombing of Quemoy in the late summer and fall of 1958 is in volume XIX.</note> and our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> position is no less good at this time. While we should make preparations, we do not require a specific degree of preparedness for the test contemplated in paragraph D. Mr.<persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> added that our Berlin stockpiles would permit us to wait as long as three months before making bur test.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then went into the subject of the motivation of the recent Soviet threat against Berlin. The United States, he said, evaluates this threat as just another in a series of probes and believes that the Soviets are not prepared to risk a war. It is, therefore, important for us to show initially that we will not evade the issue. The Soviets have left themselves some elbowroom. They have a dozen pretexts for a general war if they wish one; they did not have to provoke a crisis over Berlin. If the Soviets are convinced we are just as determined as they, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said, they have until May to find a way out of the problem they have created for themselves. In 1948 we had to resort to an airlift because we were completely unprepared for war; we are in a better position today.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> said that he would like to have the answers to three questions before assenting to any land operation: how does one define “limited military force;” second, what defense preparations would have to be made in advance to put us in a proper posture for a use of force; and third, what sort of timetable would be followed?</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that a study of these questions could take weeks, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> added that <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USCOB1">USCOB</gloss> would have to be consulted. General <persName corresp="#p_JMGDV1">Johnson</persName> offered purely illustrative comments on the type of military preparedness steps which might be taken in conjunction with a use of limited military force. General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> might, he thought, consider recommending a speed-up in the procurement of equipment, reinforcement to bring units up to strength, an increase in the size of our forces of [<hi rend="italic">by</hi>] an increase in the draft, the stopping of movement of dependents to Europe, and the stopping of tourist travel. General <persName corresp="#p_JMGDV1">Johnson</persName> was not, however, aware that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> had already taken any measures of this sort.</p>
<p>With reference to the “timetable,” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that we viewed agreement on paragraph D as a “subdecision” implementing our public pronouncements which we would send to the field to “staff out” and that the study prepared in the field would come back to Washington for approval. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> concurred that the political decision had to be taken first. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> warned of the psychological pressures which <pb xml:id="pg_244" n="244" facs="0269"/>we would face if we deferred a decision until the six months’ period fixed by the Soviets was nearing its end.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> stated that where the British and the Americans diverged was conceivably on method. The British wished to have military plans approved by this political-military group now meeting in Washington. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> agreed that details should be requested from the field commanders and should be given further study in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> suggested, and the British and French agreed, that each group should ascertain its own national plans and meet again to co-ordinate them later in the week or early in the following week. It was agreed that it would be useful to know what paragraph D meant in military terms.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> referred to the “political exercise” and asked how we convey our ideas to the Soviets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> suggested that we could take advantage of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s visit.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName>, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reiterated the view that an airlift would not be a suitable response to a stoppage of surface traffic. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that the talk about an airlift which had already taken place had had a bad psychological effect, for the Soviets will take a tougher position on ground access if they believe we are ready to resort to an airlift. On the other hand, they will backtrack if we stand firm. In any case, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said, we have no intention to mount a new airlift, and even a “garrison airlift” would be a start in this direction.</p>
<p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DASM1">Denny</persName> said that it was important to work out a timetable of actions which we would take to demonstrate to the Soviets that we mean business and are ready. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> commented that the state of readiness of our forces in Europe was not all. One had to consider <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> and our over-all deterrent in persuading the Soviets.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, after consultation with the Department of Defense, said, in reply to a suggestion of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_DASM1">Denny</persName> that a joint working party be set immediately, that we would prefer to study this first ourselves.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it was agreed that another meeting would be held as soon as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> received his instructions, which he expected before the middle of the following week.<note n="8" xml:id="d122fn8">In light of the discussion at this meeting, the Joint Chiefs of Staff prepared a statement of the military preparations, courses of action, and their method and timing that might be necessary to meet the Berlin situation. Copies of this paper, JCSM–16–59 with appendices, were transmitted to the Secretary of Defense on January 13 and to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> 2 days later.

<p>1448. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> called in <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> today in endeavor to stimulate German thinking re Berlin situation and related problems.<note n="1" xml:id="d123fn1">No other record of this conversation has been found.</note> After explaining issues involved in current tripartite discussions on Point D proposed revision Contingency Plans,<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">Regarding point D, see <ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>.</note> former invited German views. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> noted that prevailing American thinking is that large scale airlift to supply entire civil population of Berlin not practicable under present circumstances. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said response from Bonn would probably be in form of questions intended to elicit further information re relevant military facts. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> commented that essential point was to achieve adoption of basic principle to prosecute our right of land access by means at our disposal. If all details had to be decided in advance indefinite delay would result.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> also raised hypothetical question of how Ambassador would respond to query from outsider as to why <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> opposed to recognition East German regime. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said that traditional answer his Government was that recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would in effect legalize partition of Germany and thus create heavy political obstacle to reunification. If there were two recognized German states, only negotiation between two Governments with each exercising veto could provide road to reunification. As far as confederation idea concerned, <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> added, it necessarily involved veto right on both sides and breakdown of effective government would be assured as long as regimes basically hostile to each other. Therefore in practice confederation would mean replacing Four Power responsibility with entity which could not operate effectively.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> noted that overwhelming percentage of population East Germany would like to be consolidated with West on friendly not hostile basis. If this true, if there were only some way of getting two together, Soviets would inevitably be maneuvered out. Question was whether we were using enough imagination to achieve basic West German objective of consolidating Germany and at same time preserving general Western objectives. Western Governments should have a hard look to see if they were not missing a trick or two. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said we were not clear as to Chancellor’s and Foreign Office’s thinking re possibility <pb xml:id="pg_246" n="246" facs="0271"/>of working out mutually acceptable solution. We would be interested their views if possible before return of <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said this of course raised basic issues. He was glad to note feeling that at least some re-appraisal of policy served useful purpose. He did not know whether anything would come out at end, but it was good to instigate Governments to do some thinking.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said he would pass Department basic study of traditional Germany policy towards <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. There was some discussion of motives behind <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Grotewohl</persName> trip to Cairo at this time, and agreement that non-recognition policy at times tended to provide easy mechanism for use by Soviets in frustrating broader Western objectives.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Re Mikoyan</persName> aide-mémoire<note n="3" xml:id="d123fn3">See <ref target="#d121fn3">footnote 3, Document 121</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said that it appeared to indicate more clearly than ever that in Soviet opinion peace treaty would have to be signed by two Germanies. It gave impression Soviets desire discussion of peace treaty alone using Berlin as means of pressure in this direction. If crisis became more difficult it would be hard to oppose clamor of public opinion for such conference. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> commented that peace conference idea might be useful in giving Soviets way out of extreme Berlin demands.</p>
<p>Agreed talks would continue after <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> had received word from Bonn.</p>

<head>124. Editorial Note</head>
<p>On January 10 Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> summoned Chargé <persName corresp="#p_DRH1">Davis</persName> to the Foreign Ministry and handed him a note transmitting a draft peace with Germany and answering the U.S. note of December 31, 1958. (See <ref target="#d118">Document 118</ref>.) The Soviet note reiterated the points made in its November 27, 1958, note (see <ref target="#d72">Document 72</ref>) and called for a conference to draft the final peace treaty on Germany. The Embassy in Moscow transmitted the Soviet note to the Department in telegram 1405, January 10. (Department of State, Central Files, 662.001/1–1059) Copies of this note were also given to the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries with Ambassadors in Moscow and to various Soviet bloc members. The Russian-language text was printed in the Soviet press on January 11. For text of the note with the attached draft peace treaty, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> March 9, 1959, pages 333–343.</p>

<p>1409. Text of Soviet draft peace treaty for Germany published January 11 only confirms London’s excellent analysis of its pitfalls (London’s 3559 to Dept)<note n="1" xml:id="d125fn1">Telegram 3559, January 9, reported that the Soviet proposals for a German peace treaty had become more novel and sophisticated, but less constructive. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 033.6111/1959)</note> and adds additional ones which, as under Soviet definitions of “hostile activity” (Article 18), of “war propaganda” (Article 20) as well as trade (Article 39), etc., would require revolutionary change in West Germany’s domestic order as well as in its foreign policy.</p>
<p>Moscow is obviously trying keep West thoroughly off balance. Soviets have had advantage of being initiators of Berlin crisis, and it is not improbable that Soviets have additional proposals in reserve to keep West on run in hope that as public opinion becomes even more jittery while deadline nears without solution, governments will be forced more and more to consider compromises.</p>
<p>In fact, Soviets have now broadened their original offer to talk about Berlin to include German peace treaty and also, perhaps, European security (since negative response to this item is not in firm language and may well be changeable in guise of great Soviet “concession”). Can be recalled that during abortive exchanges of US, UK, and French Ambassadors with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> last spring to arrange summit meeting, West made known to Soviets that it might agree to general agenda formulation on Germany within which each side could raise subjects in which it was interested. Relying on this, on Bundestag wavering in recent months on “new approach” to Soviets involving peace treaty discussions, and on still considerable Western (especially British) sentiment for negotiation, Soviets may well conceive of their latest proposal as lure which finally gets Western states into some sort of highlevel conference where public pressures will be at maximum on them achieve positive result.</p>
<p>Obviously, Soviets will not now negotiate on reunification, and Moscow knows that West will not sign peace treaty. However, if they once have all powers assembled in some forum, they are capable of introducing new variations of previous proposals and of pulling out all propaganda stops. There is also curious provision in Soviet draft treaty (Article 45) that if all Allied powers do not ratify treaty, then Germany <pb xml:id="pg_248" n="248" facs="0273"/>(presumably meaning <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) can agree to accept treaty with those powers which wish to ratify (more or less as US did on Japanese Treaty). This may be hint of Soviet plans to announce readiness to sign separate treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> (and perhaps <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> too) at some stage of proceedings.</p>
<p>Latest Soviet proposals also intended to give new impetus to drive to get <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> recognized by West. Moscow may well believe that weakest link in armor of Western governments is failure of large part of public to understand why dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be so fatal. Although we see no reason to give up conclusion that real Soviet object is to get Allies out of Berlin and eventually to incorporate West Berlin into <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> (which maximum demands of November 27 note<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">See <ref target="#d72">Document 72</ref>.</note> made clear), first step on which Moscow might be willing temporarily to agree could involve continued Allied presence in Berlin, but at sufferance of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> which Allies would recognize. This would fit in more closely with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s original speech on November 10<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">See <ref target="#d24">Document 24</ref>.</note> and would seem to be confirmed by <persName corresp="#p_WO1">Winzer</persName>’s answer January 9 to Western journalist’s question (Berlin’s 567 to Department).<note n="4" xml:id="d125fn4">Telegram 567, January 10, reported on a press conference on January 9 at which <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Deputy Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WO1">Winzer</persName> released a 13-page note on the Berlin situation and stated that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would negotiate with the Western Allies on access to the city only if <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty were recognized. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/1–1059)</note></p>
<p>Should be noted that only <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> January 11 published Western notes of December 31<note n="5" xml:id="d125fn5">See <ref target="#d118">Document 118</ref>.</note> and that Soviet reply when attempting to justify unilateral denunciation of agreements on Berlin conspicuously fails refer to 1949 Paris Agreements.<note n="6" xml:id="d125fn6">For text of the Paris agreements, June 20, 1949, which ended the Berlin blockade, see <ref target="frus1949v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 1062–1065.</note></p>
<p>Although too early in any case to expect any real modification of Soviet position on Berlin in direction of retreat or compromise, most indications still are that Soviets are not now thinking in those terms. Latest note is firm; Soviets have advantage of being able unilaterally to turn their Berlin functions over to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> at any time; and, as <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said in US on Berlin crisis, “one does not change good positions”.</p>

<p rend="center">TELEPHONE CALL FROM THE PRESIDENT</p>
<p>The Pres asked if we would be against the establishment of a free city if it were all inclusive—East and West Germany. If that were agreeable to the Germans he supposes we would not object. The Sec said if it were agreeable but he is sure West Germany would not agree to anything that would take our troops out. That is the only thing that keeps it from being engulfed. Once they go the paper agreements are no good. The Pres would say that would be a new problem.<note n="1" xml:id="d126fn1">Apparently the President was anticipating that he would be asked questions on Berlin at his press conference on January 14, but none was raised.</note> The Sec said to be careful about implying anything about taking our troops out of Berlin. They agreed they are more rigid than we are.</p>

<p>(This meeting continued the tripartite discussion of paragraph D of the United States aide-mémoire of December 11, 1958 which had begun on January 5, 1959 and which, it was agreed at that time, would be resumed when the French Ambassador received instructions.)<note n="2" xml:id="d127fn2">See <ref target="#d122">Document 122</ref>.</note></p>

<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> reported that he had received the views of the French Government.<note n="3" xml:id="d127fn3"><persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> received his instructions on January 12. For his view of the Berlin question, a summary of the instructions, and his account of the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, see <hi rend="italic">L’Etonnement,</hi> pp. 295–298.</note> The French endorsed the principle that we must take all necessary measures to prevent the Soviets or East Germans from interfering with our access to Berlin, whether by land or by air. Our common determination to do so must be made clear to the Soviets. General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had in fact expressed this determination to Soviet Ambassador Vinogradov.<note n="4" xml:id="d127fn4">Presumably the meeting on January 7 at which the Soviet Ambassador presented the aide-mémoire of January 5; see <ref target="#d121fn3">footnote 3, Document 121</ref>.</note> However, the French did not believe that a decision can be taken at this moment regarding the precise manner in which the Allied right of access was to be reaffirmed. The French were in agreement that a military study of all contingencies and all possible courses of action should be made without delay. They could not, however, take a final decision on a hypothetical basis. It was possible that the eventual decision might be to follow the course of action suggested in paragraph D, but before a course of action could be decided upon there must be further political consultation in the light of the actions which were taken to impede access and of the other circumstances obtaining at the time. Until the present, the French had believed that the use of limited military force to demonstrate our intention to maintain access to Berlin could best be made in the air. If surface access should be blocked, they would, however, be prepared to re-examine the question.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> expressed general agreement with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>’s views. The principle on which we must act was laid down for us in the Foreign Ministers’ communiqué of December 14 and the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> communiqué of December 16.<note n="5" xml:id="d127fn5">See <ref target="#d122fn5">footnotes 5</ref> and <ref target="#d122fn6">6, Document 122</ref>.</note> The British views on the implementation of this principle were similar to those of the French. Certainly all means of doing so should be actively studied. The use of limited force in connection with rail and waterways access was probably not feasible. The best way to start asserting our right of access by limited force was probably in the air, but the British were ready to look at military plans for doing so on the ground. In any case a final decision would have to be taken by the Cabinet, and Parliamentary approval would probably be necessary.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that the issue was whether the British and French accepted paragraph D, i.e., whether they were in agreement that a blocking of ground access should be met, if necessary, with limited force on the ground. It was necessary to have agreement on this principle, he said, in order to know where we went from here.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_251" n="251" facs="0276"/>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said that the British agreed to study the possibility of using limited force in connection with ground access but that they regarded paragraph D, insofar as it meant that a challenge to ground access must be met by the use of limited force on the ground, as an operational plan rather than as a statement of principle. The appropriate use of force would not necessarily be on the ground, and the British therefore could not accept the specific wording of paragraph D.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName>’s comments gave the impression that the British did not mean to use force and would resort to an airlift instead.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> defined the principle on which the United States sought agreement as an expression of willingness to use force to defend whatever means of access was threatened; that is that force would be used on the ground if ground access was threatened and in the air if air access was threatened. <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Viscount Hood</persName> observed that this procedure would require the use of force in connection with rail and waterways access.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said that the British “feared” the United States approach to the problem because it provided for an advance commitment to one specific plan, which meant putting the cart before the horse. What was needed first was data about various plans.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName>, referring to the examples of Lebanon and Quemoy, commented that examining possible tactical plans would be useful but that what deterred the Soviets was not tactical operations but the realization of the free world’s nuclear deterrent capabilities. Only firm action on our part could prevent war.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said that the discussion appeared to be going around in circles. We had a fundamental decision; the more ready we were to implement it, the better. Berlin is not an isolated affair, and the Soviets, in their latest note,<note n="6" xml:id="d127fn6">See <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>.</note> have shown a readiness to talk. Therefore we should show no weakness and should demonstrate that we are, if necessary, prepared to fight a general war. However, the United States wants in addition to get agreement that there is one specific way to approach the problem, and this the British cannot accept.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> explained that the United States does not want to plan an airlift at this stage. The Soviets would inevitably learn of such planning, would think that we were taking a weak position and evading the issue, and would be encouraged to take a firmer stand with respect to our ground access. We wished to avoid giving the Soviets the impression we were backing away as we had in 1948. He said that United States opinion was strong on this point; we wanted no one to have the illusion that there will be another airlift.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_252" n="252" facs="0277"/>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> replied that he understood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s argument but could not agree with it. As far as an airlift was concerned, only a small “garrison” airlift would be involved. The British wished to keep some flexibility. If the object was to avoid giving the Soviets a false impression, this could be done in other ways.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> then suggested language which, he thought, might be agreed on in lieu of the language of paragraph D (see final paragraph below).</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> observed that the meaning of the language suggested by the French did not seem to be greatly different but stressed that the United States desired the British and French to face up to the issue involved in paragraph D.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> raised the question how a garrison airlift would provide an effective assertion of our right of access on the ground. If the Soviets did not interfere with the airlift for a while, the issue would become increasingly unclear. If they managed to stop the airlift later, we would be at a psychological disadvantage. Berlin stockpiles made it unnecessary to mount an airlift immediately in any case. In short, an airlift would be no solution, would involve great expense, and would amount to an abandonment of ground access.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> replied that this was a strong argument. The British asked only to have a look at the plans. They might agree. There was agreement on the principle involved. The United States had presented a strong argument as to how we should proceed to implement this principle. However, the British could not commit themselves here and now without examing the method of procedure in detail.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> pointed out the difficulty of planning to meet every degree of Soviet resistance. Access could not be maintained if Soviet forces were determined to block it, and an effort to maintain it under such circumstances would result in general war.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> expressed the view that the use of even limited military force might distort <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s defense posture.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> then suggested that the language suggested by the French be studied unilaterally and that, if agreement could be reached on wording, the precise action to be taken then be considered.</p>
<p>It was agreed that another meeting would be held later in the week or early in the following week and that the language suggested by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> would be studied in the interim.</p>
<p>The language suggested by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> was the following:</p>
<list>
<item>“1. The three Governments affirm their determination to maintain by all means of their choice their rights to free access to Berlin whether by land or air and with regard either to Soviet authorities or to East German <pb xml:id="pg_253" n="253" facs="0278"/>authorities. This determination will be brought to the attention of the Soviet Government by means to be decided in common.</item>
<item>“2. The military authorities concerned are forthwith instructed to consider the various contingencies and the practical measures to be taken.</item>
<item>“3. The final decision to implement the principle set forth in paragraph 1 above will be taken by common accord at the appropriate time taking into account all the circumstances.”</item>

<p>1467. After conversation this morning (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1464)<note n="1" xml:id="d128fn1">Telegram 1464, January 13, reported on a discussion of placing <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s in Germany. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 711.56362A/1–1359)</note> on military subjects, Chancellor said he wanted talk <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>, myself about political matters.</p>
<p>1. He believes three occupying powers Berlin must use force if necessary including against <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> police to maintain position Berlin. If this not done U.S. will have lost game. Highly unlikely Soviets would risk hot war, but if European faith in U.S. pledges and determination were shaken it would be fatal blow to Europe and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
<p>2. In recent talk with Hallstein, latter informed Chancellor economic potential six nation community is as 17 to U.S. 20. If Soviets through cold war acquire this 17 they would have vast superiority over us and dislocate U.S. economy which would result in political catastrophe. It is equally in European and U.S. interest to have faith in U.S. remain intact.</p>
<p>3. Above reflections prompted by his reading recent <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> exchanges.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> on January 9, see <ref target="#d123">Document 123</ref>. In a second conversation that day with <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> reviewed the same points because he had failed to take notes during the first conversation. (Telegram 1497 to Bonn, January 14; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/1–1359)</note> Asked <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> for comments.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_254" n="254" facs="0279"/>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> emphasized necessity not weakening on Dec 14 and Dec 16 Paris communiqués.<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">See <ref target="#d122fn5">footnotes 5</ref> and <ref target="#d122fn6">6, Document 122</ref>.</note> Thinks risk of general war reduced by maintaining firm stand agreed Paris.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> expressed opinion Soviets will not start hot war, but will adopt series slow strangulation measures regard Berlin. If Western powers firm Soviets will not allow interference access immediately. Addressing himself to me, he asked I convey his request that when military plans re Berlin are discussed, <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> be permitted share in deliberations, or, failing that, be informed of substance Allied intentions.</p>
<p>6. Chancellor resumed commentary. Thinks Soviet objective not to destroy world but to rule it. Soviets have missionary fervor. U.S. only obstacle to realization world domination. Believes damage to U.S. economy their chief present tactic. However, their representations concerning their production achievements are a “swindle”.</p>
<p>7. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said he had not informed me yesterday, since I was in Heidelberg, of his action in sending <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> to Washington and letter to Secretary to explain misgivings over appointment granted <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> to see President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d128fn4">In his January 12 letter <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> wrote that in view of the uncompromising Soviet position on Berlin it would not be right for the President to see <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and noted that he was sending <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> to Washington to help <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> present the German position.

For text of the letter, see <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Rückblenden,</hi> pp. 373–374.</note> We would be foolish to indulge in any optimism over <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> visit; aide-mémoire on Berlin<note n="5" xml:id="d128fn5">See <ref target="#d121fn4">footnote 4, Document 121</ref>.</note> was as rough and tough as ever; and the proposed peace treaty draft was outrageous. President should not receive <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>, who would play up meeting at forthcoming Party Congress as having been successful and preliminary to summit conference.</p>
<p>8. Next he talked, rather foolishly I thought, about <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s position being imperilled by the restoration of Molotov and Bulganin to favor and likelihood <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> losing office. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> looked bewildered.</p>
<p>9. I told Chancellor I totally disbelieved there had been any weakening or would be of U.S. determination on Berlin or other German problems. I had not seen report of <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> interview, but was familiar with content <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> conversation. Seemed to me request by U.S. for <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> views in connection possible negotiations with Soviets was utterly reasonable and necessary, and there could be no harm or evidence of weakening on Berlin if our two governments were to discuss in mutual confidence various tactics and matters of <pb xml:id="pg_255" n="255" facs="0280"/>substance that were certain to come up. I was sure he was entirely mistaken in displaying doubts in this regard.</p>
<p>10. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> replied that he had not intended to question the propriety of the talks between his Ambassador and Department officials, but that U.S. must not succumb to Soviet blandishments. I assured him that such an error was not in question.</p>
<p>11. Chancellor looked tired. He has had slight bronchial trouble for weeks. He talked further and at great length about <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s unreliability, and how mistaken it was for the American public to have received him so enthusiastically, etc. I told him not to worry over this, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> was a visiting curiosity.</p>
<p>12. Suggest after meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> be informed soonest possible what transpired.</p>

</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> opened by saying he regarded the meeting as very private and informal and consequently he would speak frankly. He had learned only yesterday that he was to go to Washington. The Chancellor has been suffering from a cold for three weeks and is only in his office sporadically. The Chancellor’s first idea had been to ask <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> to return to Bonn but since it was important for <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> to remain in Washington during this period he decided to send <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> mentioned the letter from the Chancellor suggesting that the President ought not to receive <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d129fn1">See <ref target="#d128fn4">footnote 4, Document 128</ref>.</note> The situation had changed <pb xml:id="pg_256" n="256" facs="0281"/>since the letter was sent and <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> did not yet know whether he was officially to deliver the letter to the Secretary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that the Secretary had sent the letter forward to the President for information.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> said that the Chancellor had been shocked by the latest Russian note and draft peace treaty.<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">See <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>.</note> Even the Chancellor had not expected such a dreadful draft. The Russians formerly talked of concluding a peace treaty with a unified Germany. Their latest proposal suggests the peace treaty would be concluded with the two Germanies. Such a proposal obviously involves the perpetuation of the division of Germany. We should give the Russians a flat refusal of their proposal, but at the same time we should press hard for negotiations. A Study Group in Bonn is examining the whole problem. This exercise should take between ten and fourteen days. Then the Germans want to come forward with their proposals on German reunification and European security. The Chancellor ardently desires the closest relationships with the United States in developing policy.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> went on to say that the Four Power Working Group which the British proposed be reconstituted should meet in Washington, not in Paris, and thereafter the four Western Foreign Ministers should confer in Washington in order to agree to the answer to give to the Russians. We need a real basis for negotiations, stating our maximum demands. When a draft is worked out the Chancellor wishes to discuss it first with the United States in order to be sure that there is no difference of opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> described his personal and immediate reaction as follows: There are dangers in stating our position in its maximum terms, thereby matching the extreme positions taken by the Soviets. Our public position should not be more extreme than the one we would be willing ultimately to agree on. A public statement engages our prestige. Any retreat would be interpreted as weakness. It is important to get the Russians to the conference table and one does not advance that prospect by confronting the world with unacceptable proposals on both sides, thereby creating a general impression of the hopelessness of negotiations. There are two reasons why we should get the Russians to the conference table. The first is to provide them with an escape route from the reckless position they have taken on Berlin. The second is that if the Russians are not ready to retreat, an early and vigorous effort to negotiate is essential to show that we were ready to exhaust all possibilities before we were confronted with a very serious situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> reviewed the notes thus far exchanged, pointing out that from them one can conclude <pb xml:id="pg_257" n="257" facs="0282"/>that the West has an opportunity to involve the Soviets in a negotiation in which they will have to talk about the reunification of Germany.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> pointed to that part of the Soviet note expressing agreement to Four Power talks in advance of the peace treaty conference. If the problem of an agenda, and a formula for participation of the two Germanies could be worked out it should be possible to move forward to a conference.</p>
<p>At this point Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> emphasized that it was not really the German intention to propose extreme positions.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> said he couldn’t tell yet how far the Germans were ready to depart from the proposals made at Geneva in 1955,<note n="3" xml:id="d129fn3">For documentation on the Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers meetings at Geneva in 1955, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1955–1957, vol. V</ref>, pp. 119 ff.</note> but that it would help the Germans a lot to know where “your ideas are going”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> replied that the Geneva proposals were good, but the problem was to know how to modify them in order to improve our negotiating position, and we looked to the German Government to provide us with new ideas.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> agreed that the initiative was really with the Germans.</p>
<p>Reverting to the Four Power talks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that while the subject would have to be discussed further it was his tentative view that we could agree to Four Power talks in Washington. He understood from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> that the French were ready to work out a reply to the Soviet note in Washington. He thought that Foreign Ministers were so busy it would be better if their time could be saved. Conceivably a high-level working group could get the job done without bringing Foreign Ministers together.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> then said he thought the British were ready to meet in Washington. The question had been put to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> in Bonn, who seemed to agree. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> said the Germans were thinking of the middle of February as a target date for a reply to the Soviet note.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> then raised the question of the Secretary’s press conference of the day before.<note n="4" xml:id="d129fn4">For a transcript of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ press conference on January 13, much of which was devoted to Germany, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> February 2, 1959, pp. 156–162. This sentence suggests that Vigderman drafted the memorandum of conversation on January 14.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> explained that when the Secretary said that he could conceive of German reunification by methods other than free elections, the Secretary meant that free elections are the obvious and natural way to reunification. Logically, however, it is not the only way. The example could be adduced of the thirteen original states of the United States which had come together without <pb xml:id="pg_258" n="258" facs="0283"/>elections. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said that he understood, but he was sure the Secretary’s statement would have its repercussions in Bonn, and perhaps a State Department spokesman should say something on the subject.</p>

<p>1477. Eyes only for Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> sent for me this morning.<note n="1" xml:id="d130fn1">According to his diary <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> at noon. The Chancellor “was disturbed to an uncommon degree” by the report of the Secretary’s press conference (see <ref target="#d129fn4">footnote 4, Document 129</ref>). <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> commented further that he wished the Secretary “would stop dropping tinder into powder kegs by being over-frank in press conferences.” (Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D 327)</note> <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> also present. He said had just held Cabinet meeting, and discussion largely confined to discussion text your press conference yesterday.</p>
<p>I verified fact he had correct transcript.</p>
<p>He concentrated remarks on that portion concerning free elections not being an absolutely exclusive method.</p>
<p>He said repercussions in Germany would be momentous, and destructive of his long established policy that reunification could only be achieved through free elections. Already most <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and FDP leaders had favored conversations with Pankow. This was for him inadmissible, since whole East Germany was in effect only an extension of Soviet Union, and idea confederation in any form totally unacceptable. Now those naive people ready negotiate with Pankow would be encouraged by interpretation they would give in their own interests to your having opened door to other possible methods bring about reunification.</p>
<p>I would characterize his and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>’s expressions as being little short of violent. I tried to assuage their alarm by placing the matter in proper perspective but to little avail.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> asked me to communicate to you urgently his preoccupation, and to inquire whether you could not, in response to a planted <pb xml:id="pg_259" n="259" facs="0284"/>question, enter into explanation as to why your response in this regard was theoretical, and did not indicate any intention of considering departure from long established policy. When I sought constructive thought as to substance, they were unproductive.</p>
<p>They anticipate shortly violent campaign against govt based on assumption U.S. ready to consider alternative to free elections, including assent negotiations between <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and Pankow.</p>
<p>If it be practicable and advisable to try to comply with Chancellor’s request, suggest you might consider some such language as follows:</p>
<list><item>“There are various theoretical possibilities for bringing about reunification of divided portions of a formerly united country. But, in the case of Germany, since Soviets have invariably denied citizens of socalled <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> right to express their wishes in a democratic manner, no negotiations could satisfactorily result unless they had as a premise the acceptance of free election procedures in both parts of Germany.”
</item></list>
<p>Chancellor said he was more concerned than ever about outcome conversions with <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>. Any communiqué following them should be drafted with utmost clarity so that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could not distort contents to serve their own purposes.</p>
<p>I am following this immediately with another telegram for limited distribution, expressing certain general thoughts on German problems.<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">Telegram 1486 from Bonn, January 14, commented on <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s impact on the German political scene, (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 762.00/1–1459)</note></p>

<p>[Here follows a list of participants.]</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic">1. Berlin</hi></p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> opened the meeting by referring to the tripartite talks which had been held with the British and French on the question of Paragraph D of the paper on Berlin contingency planning. He quoted Paragraph D of the U.S. aide-mémoire of December 11, 1958, as follows:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_260" n="260" facs="0285"/>
<list><item>“At this stage of developments [i.e., when Allied surface traffic between Berlin and West Germany are not allowed to transit the Soviet Zone without dealing with East German personnel]<note n="1" xml:id="d131fn1">Brackets in the source text.</note> and before considering resort to an airlift, an attempt to reopen access through the use of limited military force should be made in order to demonstrate our determination to maintain surface access. In any case, the Soviets and East Germans should not be allowed to entertain doubts as to our determination to do so if need be. Even if force is not resorted to at once we should continue to assert our rights to resume interrupted traffic and our intention to do so by force.”
</item></list>
<p>He mentioned that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_JMGDV1">Johnson</persName> had been participating in the talks and that he assumed the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> was currently informed.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> discussed the British position which appeared to be to evade the essential point of making a determination whether or not to respond with military force in the event of denial of allied land access rights to Berlin. The U.S. position is that the principle should be decided upon and agreed by the three powers before detailed military planning is entered into. The British wish a joint planning operation which will examine all of the military aspects of the problem—apparently before the decision is rendered on the basic principle. He said that the purpose of the meeting was to arrive at a coordinated U.S. point of view and to assure that the military judgment of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> was in consonance with the political judgment of the Department on this matter.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> indicated that the Joint Chiefs had approved on January 13 a planning paper on the military preparations for action in the Berlin situation as required by Paragraph D.<note n="2" xml:id="d131fn2">See <ref target="#d122fn8">footnote 8, Document 122</ref>.</note> The paper is now before the Secretary of Defense, who has expressed his desire to give it further consideration and perhaps to make some amendments but it represents the basic <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> thinking on the matter. The paper is for U.S. use only (copies of the draft <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> paper were provided to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> for the Department’s study and information on the understanding that it would not be considered a final document until cleared by the Secretary of Defense). General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> went on to describe the paper as the Joint Chiefs idea of all the steps that must be taken to prepare for possible action in the Berlin situation. He felt that it was important the Department understand what the military requirements of the situation are.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> then intervened to inquire if the Department had taken a firm political decision to press for the action envisioned in Paragraph D. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that the decision was taken in principle by the Department to take all possible measures to secure our right of land access to Berlin and at the same time to make sure that a posture which <pb xml:id="pg_261" n="261" facs="0286"/>indicated that we were contemplating an airlift solution be avoided. He felt that if the USSR could be sure that the allies plan to react by instituting an airlift they would know we were “walking away” from Berlin. This evidence of weakness would be extremely important to the Soviets in planning their subsequent moves. He referred in passing to the parallel situation in 1948 and his belief that a firm response on the ground at that time to the blockade would have been successful and would have had a basic influence on subsequent Russian tests of our intentions as in Korea. In response to a further question from General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> asking clarification of our policy, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> stated specifically that the Department was supporting the language of Paragraph D. Paragraph D must, of course, be considered in the context of the entire paper on contingency planning, including the later section which discusses the possibility of an airlift. He then quoted the last paragraph, Section E, as follows:</p>
<list><item>“As concomitant to the above course of action, we should consider whether the Three Powers should not take some additional step to guarantee their unrestricted air access to Berlin, which would be essential to maintaining the status and security of the city. The Three Powers might, for example, reformulate and restate their Berlin guarantee, modifying it to add that they will regard any interference with their right and practice of unrestricted access to Berlin by air, including operation of their civil air carriers, as an attack upon their forces and upon themselves. Here the issue of flight in the corridors over 10,000 feet might be solved by a simple Three Power agreement to fly at an altitude appropriate to efficient operation of individual aircraft. Communist harassment of our air access, which would be possible only through patent application of force, would be clear evidence of provocative intent. If it occurred, we could then take such military / political / economic counteraction as necessary to maintain Berlin with assurance that such action would have the support of American, French, British and German public opinion.”
</item></list>
<p>He pointed out that we were not excluding the possibility of an airlift or indeed any other possibility but that we felt that the psychological effect of the action proposed under Section D was essential.</p>
<p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> indicated his full concurrence with the Department’s position. He pointed out that the decision involved not only planning but the taking of many preparatory steps ahead of the time of action. If we sent an armed force into East Germany, we must be prepared to follow through. It should only be a matter of minutes before reinforcements were sent in if the probing force were halted. General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> then asked again if the State Department was prepared to support the statement in Paragraph D. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> answered yes but pointed out the purpose of the meeting was to be sure that “he whose ox may be gored” is also in agreement.</p>
<p>There was a general discussion of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> paper in which it was pointed out that the planners had attempted to take every possibility <pb xml:id="pg_262" n="262" facs="0287"/>into consideration. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> pointed out that the concept was summarized in Appendix B of the paper and that this was the most sensitive part. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked if a part of the proposal involved notifying the USSR in advance of our intentions. General Taylor responded that such notification was implicit but that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> paper represented a “military scenario” and that a “political scenario” was needed as a companion piece. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> responded that we had recently been encouraged by evidence that the Russians desire to negotiate and that this would indicate the desirability of signalling our intentions in advance.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then asked if his assumption is correct that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> did not wish at this point to engage in joint military planning with the British and French. The consensus of response appeared to be that detailed planning should be conducted in Europe instead of the U.S. and that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> should be in overall charge. In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s question General Taylor indicated that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s views had already been requested and would be incorporated in the final revision of plans which would be transmitted to <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> after approval at the governmental level.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then commented on the French point of view. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> attempted to provide new language for Paragraph D which would bridge the gap between U.S. and UK thinking but without success. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that recent reports from Paris indicate that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">DeGaulle</persName> has been highly critical of U.S. policies and actions except as regards Berlin but this support of our firm stand in Berlin does not appear to be reflected in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>’s attitude here.</p>
<p>With regard to the British position, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> has rigid instructions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJH1">Whitney</persName> has recently reported<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">Not further identified.</note> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] the British attitude which he thinks may stem from the influence of <persName corresp="#p_MAL1">Lord Mountbatten</persName>, who has been reported as saying that Britain cannot afford the risk of annihilation over the Berlin issue. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> suggested that he might write Montbatten on the matter and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed it would be useful if Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> could point out the U.S. view that if every test of strength with the Russians is viewed in terms of the risk of total destruction, there can be no agreement on a firm response in any situation.<note n="4" xml:id="d131fn4">On January 14 Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> wrote Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MAL1">Mountbatten</persName>, apparently along the lines taken by the discussion at this meeting. No copy of his letter has been found, but it is referred to in <persName corresp="#p_MAL1">Mountbatten</persName>’s reply, dated January 23, in which he agreed on the necessity for taking a firm decision on Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_MAL1">Mountbatten</persName> stressed, however, the need to take <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> along with the three Western Allies, and the British believed this could not be done until every possibility of negotiation had been exhausted. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/1–2659)</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_263" n="263" facs="0288"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then discussed the West German attitude and indicated that this must be explored further. One of the problems is <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s detachment as a result of his illness last month. He has just sent <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Herr Dittmann</persName> of the Foreign Office to the U.S. to discuss matters with the Department and we are in active consultation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> to whom we have put several leading questions designed to stimulate German thinking on possible solutions to the Berlin and German problems. We do not yet know the German reaction on such questions as those posed by the proposals for the U.S. response to closure of ground access to Berlin. How far would West Germany like to see us go in our response to the closing off of access to Berlin? The German attitude has been that the U.S. should stand firm. The question is what will they do in support of such a stand and what risks will they be willing to take. Will they furnish West German troops if this is considered desirable?</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> asked if there were any State Department objections to placing General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> in charge. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked if <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s role involved both planning and command of actual operations. He indicated that he could not respond to the question without further study since larger issues were involved but that his initial reaction was that there were no other operational commanders who could be assigned to the job. General Taylor indicated that General <persName corresp="#p_HGHI1">Hodes</persName> (<gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss>) could be given command but that in principle it should be <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>. It was agreed that the Department would express its views on this matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> added that the lack of enthusiasm in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would create a lot of problems and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> added that it might be best to have planning conducted on a strictly U.S. basis under <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s direction as <gloss target="#t_CINCEUR1">CINCEUR</gloss>.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> commented on the conversation with the President on January 13<note n="5" xml:id="d131fn5">No record of this conversation has been found.</note> at which the President had expressed doubts as to our legal status in Berlin as the basis for military action to reopen ground access. The President mentioned that General <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName> was not fully satisfied with the arrangements he was able to make on this matter while in Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> referred to the Department’s recent publication on this point which makes a good case.<note n="6" xml:id="d131fn6">For text of the memorandum on the legal aspects of the Berlin situation, December 19, 1958, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> January 5, 1959, pp. 5–13.</note> He pointed out that our legal rights are based not only on the <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName>–Zhukov talks but on the European Advisory Commission agreements in London in 1944 and on the Paris communiqué of 1949<note n="7" xml:id="d131fn7">For text, see <ref target="frus1949v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 1062–1065.</note> following the end of the Berlin airlift. He added that our primary rights are those of conquest and stem as well from the quid <pb xml:id="pg_264" n="264" facs="0289"/>pro quo established by U.S. withdrawal from the area which became the Soviet zone in exchange for our position in Berlin.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> requested the Department’s views on how we should react if the Soviet authorities pulled out of East Germany and turned over their responsibilities to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials, i.e., documentation, travel control, etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated that we proposed to refuse to deal with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials. He felt that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authorities might continue to let us have access to Berlin without recognition of their authority. If they did not do so they would be faced with the difficult decision of attacking us or establishing a blockade. He then discussed the “agency theory” to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had earlier referred<note n="8" xml:id="d131fn8">Regarding the “agency theory,” see <ref target="#d68">Document 68</ref>.</note> and which elicited a violent negative reaction from West Germany which the Secretary thought was unjustified. The West Germans are now dealing on a de facto basis with the East Germans in many activities. Despite this they refuse to consider the possibility that we might deal with the East Germans as “agents” of the USSR. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> added that the Secretary’s public mention of the “agency theory” was based on the earlier contingency plan for Berlin and that the situation today makes it clear that the USSR has rejected the agency concept but instead proposes to substitute East German for Soviet personnel.</p>
<p>General Taylor then stressed the necessity for “domestic education” to prepare the American public for our proposed Berlin plans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> felt that there has been to date a good emotional reaction in the U.S. as evidenced by the bi-partisan applause in Congress at the mention of Berlin in the State of the Union message.<note n="9" xml:id="d131fn9">For text of the State of the Union message, January 9, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>, 1959,</hi> pp. 5–18.</note> He agreed, however, that the actual issues have not been explained so that there would be clear public understanding and that further education will indeed be necessary. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> commented that it would be more difficult if we “go it alone” without support of our allies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed and pointed out that this was what was so disappointing about the British attitude. He felt that the President would have to intercede with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> if we are unable to make progress at the lower levels. Reference was made to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s recent letter to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on this subject and to the Secretary’s response which was planned for despatch today.<note n="10" xml:id="d131fn10"><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s letter, transmitted under cover of a note from <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, January 8, suggested that the Western Allies should study the implications of all military plans regarding Berlin without necessarily deciding on any of them and recommended that the United States and the United Kingdom seek to achieve a Soviet retreat on Berlin and force the Soviets to accept responsibility for Western access even if they turned over their obligations to the East Germans. (Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> Correspondence)</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_265" n="265" facs="0290"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated in response to General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>’s question that the <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> discussion with the Secretary on Friday will bear heavily on the problem of Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> feels strongly that we must be prepared to meet the Russian challenge.</p>
<p>The discussion on Berlin closed with a strong expression of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> view by General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> that an airlift will not settle the Berlin issue and should be avoided if at all possible.</p>

<p>In hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 14 and 16, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> discussed the Berlin situation. The Secretary of State described to the Committee the discussions with the British, French, and West Germans on contingency planning and outlined the U.S. view on reunification of Germany. At the end of the sessions he approved the text of a bipartisan resolution that fully endorsed the position of the United States on Berlin as set forth in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> declaration of December 16, 1958 (see <ref target="#d122fn6">footnote 6, Document 122</ref>).

<p>In brief testimony on the military aspects of the Berlin situation <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> stated that the United States felt it “must hold Berlin at all costs, even to general war,” and informed the Committee that the Joint Chiefs were at that very moment working on plans regarding Berlin.

<p>Secretary said he was not surprised that Soviets had not retreated or weakened substantive position regarding Berlin or Germany as whole. However, they have indicated primarily through <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> that November 27 note not to be treated as ultimatum. Soviets may be expected to press their demands until they establish whether or not we are prepared to fight over Berlin. Secretary stated we must show we are prepared to fight as at Quemoy–Matsu, or Soviets will push us from retreat to retreat. Here we were in somewhat different position in having Allies directly involved with whom we must consult and work out common position.</p>
<p>Application this principle of firmness in Berlin situation, Secretary continued, presents difficulties. Soviets have us in position where they can perhaps make us shoot first. They could by blowing up bridges and erecting road blocks isolate Berlin and maneuver us into having to use force initially to maintain land access. To obtain support public opinion our Allies and in US involves some real problems.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_267" n="267" facs="0292"/>
<p>For Soviets to start compromising at this relatively early stage, Secretary noted, would be contrary their normal techniques. After we have satisfied them they cannot gain their objectives without fighting, we may have to provide them with discussions as a means to save face. US has been having talks with Communist China since 1955. These are not very promising but their existence tends to provide protective coloration under which fighting can be suspended. Secretary thought it might perhaps be useful to have talks with Soviets regarding Germany and meeting of Foreign Ministers but without agenda limited in such a way we would only be discussing what Soviets want to discuss. Their draft peace treaty was obviously unacceptable. General talks regarding Germany might provide cover at least for suspension planned Soviet measures regarding Berlin.</p>
<p>Secretary said he felt there could with advantage be greater flexibility in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> thinking on reunification. <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> had tremendous assets in fact overwhelming percentage East German population opposed to present Government and would like to join in free institutions of West Germany. Secretary had impression that aloofness which exists to some extent plays into hands of Soviet and Pankow authorities by making it impossible for <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> to utilize these favorable assets in East Germany. This was only a general observation which might be difficult to express in concrete proposals. Secretary felt that if <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> came up with proposals involving more contacts with people of East Germany without interposition of Pankow regime East German officials would be very frightened.</p>
<p>Secretary thought we should therefore explore possibility of meeting with Soviets about Germany with dual purpose of resolving Berlin situation and perhaps coming out with some advantage. It was perhaps remote prospect but Soviets sometimes made sudden and unpredictable moves as in case of Austrian Treaty. Soviets might after unknown period of time come to conclusion situation deteriorating in East Germany and they may want to find a way out. We must keep pressing as we did for eight years on Austrian Treaty.</p>
<p>Regarding suggested Working Group discussions among four Western Powers, it was noted that Washington as locus which desired by <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> acceptable to US and we understood probably also to British and French at least insofar as drafting reply to January 10 note was concerned. Meeting of four Western Foreign Ministers might not be necessary if progress in Working Group satisfactory.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said he had received instructions to express concern as to interpretation and effect of Secretary’s statements at press conference <pb xml:id="pg_268" n="268" facs="0293"/>January 13<note n="4" xml:id="d133fn4">For a transcript of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ press conference on January 13, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> February 2, 1959, pp. 156–162.</note> regarding relationship free elections to German reunification. <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> Government afraid would be interpreted as support for idea of confederation as first step towards German reunification, and that opposition would take advantage of situation. Feared position of Government would be endangered unless some clarification made. Coming at time of <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> visit press would inevitably interpret as marking change US policy.</p>
<p>Secretary noted press can be troublesome when leading questions asked, answers to which are then misinterpreted or exaggerated. Referring to specific three comments on free elections which he had made during press conference, Secretary asked what could be answer to query “Do we say, no free elections, no reunification.” One obviously could not take position that reunification without free elections would not be accepted, as for example in case of successful revolt in East Germany. Unification of US not achieved via free elections but by legislative action of different states, nor was reunification in 1865 so achieved. If reunification came in Germany it might well be by some other method than free elections. To seek free elections is our policy and we see no better method now to achieve reunification. However, Soviets rightly fear reunification might be forced by people East Germany and we have no desire to allay their fears in this respect. When they agree to reunification it will be because their hand forced by situation in <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>Secretary said that confederation as proposed by Soviets obviously did not mean reunification but consolidation division of Germany. Any idea confederation of this kind acceptable to US was wrong. However, Secretary could conceive of confederation on terms that might enable <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> to capitalize on feeling East German people and get rid of Communist Government. If confederation gave opportunity for free expression of views by East Germans regarding form of government, not likely Soviets would be pleased.</p>
<p>As to <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> visit, Secretary commented that talks would not lead to any change US policy, which would be reaffirmed. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> has been treated very well by American people, but latter would not basically be fooled. Communiqué was not envisaged after <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> meeting with either Secretary or President. We will undoubtedly have to give some sort of background briefing to press so as to make it more difficult for Soviets to falsify. When <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> saw Secretary,<note n="5" xml:id="d133fn5">See <ref target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note> latter said he assumed <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> not here to negotiate and we were not planning to negotiate with him. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had apparently acquiesced though <pb xml:id="pg_269" n="269" facs="0294"/>unenthusiastically. We would make efforts to minimize misconceptions which Soviets might try to create regarding talks.</p>

<p>1. Forwarded herewith are comments by the Joint Chiefs of Staff on actions which might be taken in preparation to meet Soviet or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interference with our right of access to Berlin.<note n="1" xml:id="d134fn1">JCSM–16–59, January 13, was not attached to the source text, but see <ref target="#d122fn8">footnote 8, Document 122</ref>.</note> The Joint Chiefs of Staff and I recognize that for political, budgetary and other reasons, many of the actions listed in the J.C.S. paper, while militarily desirable, cannot be taken on the timetable suggested, and some of the actions cannot be taken short of an actual challenge by the Soviets or the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> of our right of access to Berlin.</p>
<p>2. The list of desirable military actions which has been prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff should not be interpreted as essential preconditions which have to be met prior to making a firm political decision, in concert with our allies, to use whatever degree of force is necessary to protect our right of surface and air access to Berlin. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are in agreement with my judgment that a firm political decision is an essential first step which should precede detailed military planning and that this political decision should embody the following principles:</p>
<list>
<item>a. That we will meet a challenge to surface access to Berlin by necessary military action on the ground;</item>
<item>b. That we will not evade the issue by reacting to a surface blockade by the establishment of an airlift;</item>

<item>c. That we will meet the challenge where it occurs—either in the air or on the ground or both;</item>
<item>d. That we will be prepared to follow-up initial actions with increasing measures of military force, if required, and will accept the risk of general war.</item>
</list>
<p>3. In order that achievement of this fundamental agreement with our allies may not be confused with military detail, it is requested that the listing of possible actions in Appendixes “A” and “B” of the J.C.S. study not be provided to the British and the French.

<p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated matters; see volume X, Part 1, <ref target="#d62">Document 62</ref>.]</p>
<p>The Secretary said if a different party came to power <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> could be sure its viewpoint would be the same. The Secretary said he did <pb xml:id="pg_271" n="271" facs="0296"/>not think it would change as long as present conditions prevailed. He recalled that at the time of the Berlin blockade and airlift, when Governor Dewey had just been nominated and was expected to win the forthcoming elections, the first action taken by the Governor was to associate Senator Vandenberg and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> with him in a statement of complete support for the Democratic administration’s position on Berlin. The Minister would be under a great illusion if he felt that the present attitude concerning Berlin would change with a change in administration. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> declared that the Soviets openly expressed the view that they saw no difference between the Democratic and Republican Parties, but he thought the position required a change from a rigid to a more flexible attitude.</p>
<p>The Secretary pointed out that he had been under constant criticism from our Allies about inflexibility. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said he had noted this and had noted that this criticism had had some influence on the Secretary. The Secretary said that this related perhaps to the formula for the reunification of Germany through free elections, approved by the Summit Conference in July 1955.<note n="1" xml:id="d135fn1">For documentation on the discussion of German reunification at the Geneva Summit Conference, July 18–23, 1955, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1955–1957, vol. V</ref>, pp. 361 ff.</note> He wanted to say that we did not alter an agreed policy unilaterally. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> asked whether we did not, however, change policies by agreement.</p>
<p>The Secretary made the point that no policy was permanently unchangeable. We did not alter an agreed policy unilaterally but were always capable of changing it if it were reasonable to do so. He wanted to make clear that no formula about Berlin would be acceptable if the Soviets had in mind attempting, by working through the East German regime, to impose its viewpoint. This could only lead to serious consequences.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that what the Soviets had suggested was a six-month period for negotiating the problem. He wanted to make it very clear that the Soviet Union wanted to obtain no privileges in the situation—either for itself or the German Democratic Republic—nor did it want to deprive the United States of anything. It wanted West Berlin to be neutralized and demilitarized under guarantees by the Great Powers or, if necessary, by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. If we were agreeable, a permanent commission could be established to guarantee non-interference and freedom of access from all the sides. It welcomed other proposals that were based on non-interference. If nothing happened in six months, the Soviets would turn over their powers to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>—a state that has existed for seven years and on whose territory the lines of communication lie. The Soviet Union did not seek changes in the internal system of West Berlin. It had <pb xml:id="pg_272" n="272" facs="0297"/>no illusions that it could be changed. The population could live under capitalism if it desired. Berlin (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) could become a testing ground for cooperation between us instead of a hot-bed of aggression. It could be a meeting spot for countries to come together.</p>
<p>The Secretary stressed that we were prepared to negotiate but not only about Berlin and about a peace treaty, but about all the questions involved. By other questions he meant steps to bring about reunification. The Soviet peace treaty draft was a call to perpetuate the division of Germany. The German problem should be discussed without any diktat as to subjects. Interrelated with all this—Berlin, peace treaty and East Germany—was the problem of European security. This close link was recognized at the Geneva Summit meeting and the problem of European security should be discussed too.</p>
<p>The Secretary said the United States understood the Soviet preoccupations about Germany. If we could agree on reunification or a peace treaty, necessarily considered in the context of Europe as a whole, the Soviet Union could and should be given assurances against the rebirth of German militarism. The United States wanted no political or strategic advantage from the situation.</p>
<p>The Secretary said the German problem was becoming more difficult to solve and any repetition of the June 1953 outbreak which might take place would be occurring in much more dangerous circumstances. We recognized there were good and bad Germans and that the situation that evolved after World War I might evolve again.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said he saw no reflection of our sympathetic attitude toward the Soviet Union in our proposals. In fact, the Soviet leaders interpreted them in just the opposite way. They believed that lack of a peace treaty contributed to the perpetual division of Germany. Their draft did not assure reunification by itself but would bring conditions which would help rather than hinder reunification. Soviet objection to discussing reunification was not based on a position of diktat. Reunification was something to be brought about in the first instance by the two Germanies. They could be assisted but not replaced. The Federal Republic has refused to talk and has been supported in this by the United States. To put <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s position crudely, he wanted to try to annex the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>; liquidate its socialist regime; remain in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>; continue atomic rearmament; and bring about conditions which would allow German revanchists to become active when they would be strong enough to do so. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would not want to liquidate the socialist regime, but would resist. And, it was a Soviet ally in the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets believed that the aim in raising the problem as we raised it was to set our countries at loggerheads.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_273" n="273" facs="0298"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said he had had many talks with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2"><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> made a state visit to Bonn April 23–26, 1958.</note> who showed no haste for reunification since he realized his approach to it was unreal and he could not accept any other approach. He preferred to wait until West Germany became stronger and when with the help of the United States, he could speak in a different tone. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> asked whether the United States position was that it did, in fact, want German reunification through annexation of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to West Germany and did want the latter to remain armed and in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> while the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> withdrew from the Warsaw Pact—and in that event was ready to reassure the Soviets by a type of pact which it now rejected.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that he had tried to indicate in his press conference<note n="3" xml:id="d135fn3">For a transcript of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ press conference on January 13, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> February 2, 1959, pp. 156–162.</note> our complete philosophy about dealing with the German problem. We had to take into account the special position of countries lying next door to Germany and could not press any solution. But he wanted <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> to have a chance to read carefully what the President and he had said. While he did not expect the Soviet Union to accept this to any extent now he would welcome the chance to expound fully on it. He repeated that any reunification of Germany should be accompanied by security arrangements, treaties, or the like, which would bring us together, along with Germany. He did not think West Germany objected to this and he referred to the treaty we had proposed in 1946.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> replied that we had had much in common in the 1945–46 period and our proposals had been more dramatic then than now. He asked whether the Secretary had anything more specific or positive to say than what had been said at the press conference. The direction of the latter had been interesting but he did not know where it led. He did not like the President’s statement that we believed in <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and that what had taken place in 1914 could not be the basis of our present policy.<note n="4" xml:id="d135fn4">Not further identified.</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said, reverting to an earlier topic, that the events of June 1953 could not occur again not because the West would not attempt to repeat them but because East Germany was now different. Errors in administration had been made but great changes had taken place in the past five years. Methods of administration and government had improved. There was one socialist party but other parties as well. Unofficially, he could say that they had had to take reparations from East Germany because they did not get them from West Germany. Thus the economic situation had been bad in 1953. The main thing was that the <pb xml:id="pg_274" n="274" facs="0299"/>economic situation had improved. This was due to the fact that the Soviets had stopped taking reparations in 1953 and were now paying for all goods from East Germany and covering all occupation expenses. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had taken a more aggressive tone by holding the Bundestag meeting in West Berlin<note n="5" xml:id="d135fn5">The Bundestag met in Berlin on October 1, 1958.</note> because he saw the situation improving in East Germany and felt he might lose any possibility of influencing it. The <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> decided at last year’s party congress to match West German living standards by 1963. The socialist regime was strong in East Germany.</p>
<p>The Secretary referred to <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s remarks about alleged Western attempts to incite turmoil in East Germany. He said that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> was quite wrong about this. The United States not only did not desire such trouble, it would not like to see it happen. This would be dangerous for all of us.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said the danger lay in our position and that there might be elements in West Germany taking a different view from ours. These could bring about a deterioration in US-Soviet relations in spite of ourselves.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that free elections were no cure-all. The Soviet Union was not against them in principle but they were not the means of uniting Germany at present. Two German States could not be eliminated by vote—an interim stage was necessary.</p>

<p>The Secretary said that as a final point he felt he should not leave the Minister under any doubt about the Berlin situation. The Western Powers would not acquiesce in any Soviet turnover of responsibilities in the Eastern zone to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. We had no way of physically compelling the Soviet Union to discharge what was referred to in the agreement of 1949 as the occupation, but our side could not be compelled to recognize the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as a substitute for the USSR.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that the Soviets had, first of all, proposed a free city. If the proposal were accepted, with any observations and amendments suggested by us and with guarantees, this question would not arise. If the proposal did not lead anywhere they would have to carry through with their announced turnover. The Secretary said that, in this case, we would have to follow through with our announced intentions.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said he hoped that all this would not arise. The complications in the situation, however, depended upon us. If we prejudged the situation in advance and if nothing had changed about Berlin, the Soviets would be compelled to fulfill their commitment. They wanted no aggravation of the situation. They suggested that we consider corrections and amendments to their proposals. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> apparently complicated matters as far as we were concerned and perhaps he could consider such corrections and amendments as well.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that he had been authorized by the United Kingdom and France to state that the United States attitude expressed by him was fully supported by them.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said this could all be reconsidered, but not here and now. He thought that the Secretary’s reference to the authorization of our Allies might have stemmed from some apprehension on the Secretary’s part that he had been leading them forward and that they had been hanging on his coattails.</p>

<p>The President said he had heard from the Secretary of State about his conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and could say that the Secretary of State had reflected accurately the views of the United States Government concerning Berlin, the Far East and other matters covered. It was understood by both sides that these were conversations and not negotiations. The purpose was for each to explore the mind of the other to see if it were possible to find a better basis for understanding. If these had been negotiations they would have had to have been on a more formal basis with experts present (the Secretary of State added “and allies”, to which the President agreed). The President recalled his previous visit to Moscow in 1945 and said that he thought that was the only time he had met Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> before. He also recalled meeting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in Geneva. The conversations there had been sterile so far as any material advance was concerned but they had nevertheless been useful. The President was convinced that the Soviet people, as the people of the United States, wanted peace and to remove the anxieties that existed on both sides. It was the function of governments and statesmen to find programs that could be agreed upon and a path which could be followed by both countries that could lead to better feeling between our peoples. It was not our purpose to condemn communism or the Russian people. That would be wrong and the Russian people should have whatever government they wanted, but there was no reason why we could not find a path which could lead to better relations between us. In <pb xml:id="pg_277" n="277" facs="0302"/>all aspects in our foreign policy where we have a firm position such as that concerning Berlin, we try nevertheless to be conciliatory and we seek to find a way for our two peoples to raise their standards of living and find a better life.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said he had instructions from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to convey his cordial greetings and his wishes for the good health of the President. He had also asked him to say that, knowing the President as he did, he hoped the President would make use of his second term to improve relations between the two countries. It was necessary to make a start and while the first agreement might not be important it was possible for it to snowball and lead to a great improvement. He said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had remarked that if he had been permitted to vote in the United States he would have voted for the President. He had had prolonged talks in the United States and he thought the Secretary of State could confirm that they had been useful. The Secretary of State had made several statements that had been gratifying to him. He had said that it was not the policy of the United States to act against the Soviet Union and that the United States had no desire for violent action with respect to East Germany. The question of European security had also been discussed. What the President had just said was gratifying and he hoped it would find reflection in the practical steps to be taken. Although the Secretary of State had made some specific remarks about atomic tests cessation and about surprise attack, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> did not feel that on some other matters any practical steps were contemplated. He thought that the conclusion of the German peace treaty would have a great importance and that they could find common ground on this matter. There were forces however which opposed this and in this connection he drew attention to Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s statement of January 12.<note n="1" xml:id="d137fn1">At a press conference following a meeting of the <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> Parliamentary Party Group in Bonn on January 12, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had stated that the proposed Soviet draft German peace treaty was unacceptable.</note> <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> apparently desired to influence the U.S. position on the question of a peace treaty by hastily expressing his own view. It seems strange that the representative of the defeated country should be the first to come out against a possible peace treaty. Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> believes that by delaying a peace treaty he might become stronger, exploit the differences between us and base his position upon force. He was ignoring the existence of a second German state and was conducting subversive activities in an attempt to overthrow it. If such a policy were followed, the German Democratic Republic might attempt to bring about changes in the Federal German Republic. Such a line of policy was fraught with danger. Soviet Union thought that if a peace treaty were concluded, perhaps with the two German states, this might open up the road for reunification. The U.S. Secretary <pb xml:id="pg_278" n="278" facs="0303"/>of State kept his eye on what <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> thought but so far as a peace treaty was concerned there was also Great Britain and France. The Soviets attach great importance to the peace treaty question. The peace treaty could of course not settle the question of reunification but it could prepare the ground. The Soviets would be persistent in pressing for a peace treaty. If the United States supported <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s position on this matter, then the Soviet Union and the other Eastern European countries would have to find their own independent way to a solution of that question. He hoped the peace treaty would serve to bring the Soviet Union and the United States together. We were both faced with many problems nowadays and we should try to solve some of them. He realized that these were not negotiations and there was some advantage in the fact that they were merely conversations since it was possible to speak more frankly. He wished to express the hope that the President and the U.S. Government would examine the outstanding points between us and find a way to resolve them. He wished to assure the President that all of their steps in foreign affairs were designed to consolidate peace and to prevent war although some of the steps they had taken had been described as leading to new aggravations.</p>
<p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated matters; see volume X, Part 1, <ref target="#d64">Document 64</ref>.]</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> observed that the President had covered many subjects and he had been much pleased with what the President had said. With regard to Germany the Soviet Union had no desire to seek revenge or to place Germany in a subjugated position. The Soviet Union had good relations with East Germany and would like to have good relations with the Germans in West Germany. About a year ago he had gone to Bonn and had talked with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> as well as with German business leaders and others, and he thought the Germans did want peace because they know what a new war would mean. There were however groups in West Germany that were revenge-minded and wished to bring about changes by forceful means. Although he did not know him well it seemed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> was like a sponge who concentrated in himself these feelings. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> knew how to talk and they had had an interesting conversation in which <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had made some reassuring statements. However, the Chancellor was not constant in his policies. Perhaps these zigzags were deliberate. As an example he had asked <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> if he considered it right that West Germany did not recognize Poland and Czechoslovakia. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had replied that he was personally favorable to the establishment of relations but thought that the Soviet Union would have objections. When <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had said the Soviet Union thought the contrary, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> said he would establish relations. It is true that <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> was present and had said nothing in assent to this position. Nothing however had been done despite <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s <pb xml:id="pg_279" n="279" facs="0304"/>remark and two months later he made inadmissible statements concerning Germany’s eastern frontiers, stating that they should be changed although it is true that he said only peaceful methods should be used. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> knows that Poland and Czechoslovakia would not give up territory. Statements of this kind encourage those in Western Germany who seek revenge. The Soviet Union does however desire to improve its relations with West Germany. From the information at the disposal of the Soviet Union the limitations that had been established for West Germany had been practically brought to nought and they might be done away with altogether. It appeared that they were being given rockets. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that he had raised the question of the law passed by the German Bundestag concerning missiles and that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had tried to reassure him that this was only a theoretical step and had no practical significance. Recently <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> had spoken of introducing these arms in Germany more quickly. Despite reassurances, the Soviet Union had misgivings that Germany was getting more arms than were needed for defense purposes. The Soviet Union had no objection to German possession of defensive armaments.</p>
<p>With regard to elections there was a time back in 1946 when the United States and Soviet positions were close on such questions as elections, demilitarization, etc. He had no intention in engaging in polemics but the fact remains that to date there were two German states with practically no relations between them and West Germany did not even want to talk. Even armies at war found means to talk to each other through third parties. Under these conditions how could free elections settle the problem. The time might come when free elections would be possible but in the present situation they were no cure-all. Therefore the Soviet Union thought that intermediate steps and forms should be evolved. A coalition government should be formed and no matter how weak it was such a situation would be better than the present total lack of relations. A peace treaty, far from preventing the reunification of Germany, would assist in achieving this goal.</p>
<p>[Here follows discussion of an unrelated matter; see volume X, Part 1, <ref target="#d64">Document 64</ref>.]</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> pointed out that the President had indicated that if Germany had no military obligations it would have an economic advantage. There was a way to avoid this. They could revert to the old position and ask for some reparations from Germany and thus deprive her of any advantage. There were also other ways of preventing danger.</p>
<p>The President intervened to say that he had said this would be an opportunity for the Germans.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> continued that arrangements could be made for the Germans to help the underdeveloped countries.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_280" n="280" facs="0305"/>
<p>[Here follows discussion of an unrelated matter; see volume X, Part 1, <ref target="#d64">Document 64</ref>.]</p>
<p>The President said <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> was familiar with our form of Government and if Congress exaggerated our need for arms as he sometimes thought they tended to do, it was because the Congress represented the sum of the fears of our people. It was clear that we had different views on Germany and Berlin. If those problems were difficult to resolve now let us leave them aside and tackle them later when they could be resolved. We now center our attention on this problem because it is the most important and difficult. The President said that our people have definite views and debate them sharply but in a few things they are closely united and there should be no doubt in His Excellency’s mind about our unity on the question of Berlin and Germany. The President therefore suggested we tackle other problems and perhaps by solving them we could develop a better climate and more mutual trust.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> suggested we should end the cold war. This was the reason for the military appropriations by the Congress and the Soviet Union did not consider that it was to blame for the cold war. There was no basis for the suspicion that they would commit aggression. As for Berlin there had been no exchange of views. In the time before us he hoped that we would advance some views instead of taking a purely negative line. He realized the desire to seek a settlement of easier problems. Some such problems had been resolved but that did not seem to help in improving our relations.</p>
<p>The President said that in several meetings between the Soviet Union and the West during and at the end of the war we had undertaken certain responsibilities. He had been there at that time and his own forces had withdrawn to the agreed line. Part of this agreement was that Berlin would be handled as it is today and he did not think it fair to call it negative when we insisted upon discharging our responsibilities there.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that as far as the earlier part was concerned he had no complaints. However the occupation had been terminated in East and in West Germany. Only Berlin had occupation forces. They did not ask that Berlin be turned over to East Germany or that Soviet troops replace ours. After such a long period after the war the occupation should be ended. Berlin should be demilitarized and turned into a free city with no loss or gain on either side. He hoped the President would consider the matter again and that a settlement could be found which would involve no risk.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said one of the difficulties is that it is believed in Germany and elsewhere that the government in East Germany was not a Government of Germans but one that was wholly imposed upon them and hated by the Germans. It was a form of masked occupation as long as the government was not responsive to the will of the people. The <pb xml:id="pg_281" n="281" facs="0306"/>United States had proposed free elections but on that question the Soviet Union was persistently negative.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said that this view was spread from abroad and did not correspond to the facts. The Government of East Germany was supported by Socialists, Liberals and Social Democrats in East Germany. The people in the East German Government did not spring to power by accident. They were people who are well known there. Many personalities in the government had been in the Bundestag in the time of the Kaiser. One, <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Grotewohl</persName>, was a Social Democrat leader and had never been a Communist. The head of the Parliament, Dikmann, had never been a Communist but was once Secretary to Streseman. If one compared the composition of the governments in East and West Germany it would be found that the government in East Germany was more authoritative. Recently elections had been held by secret ballot in East Germany and the people overwhelmingly supported the government. It should be easy to get true information about the situation there. Neither the Soviet Government nor Soviet forces interfered in East Germany. The East Germans were allies just as we had relations with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. We were allied to one part of Germany and the Soviet Union to the other. This was a bad situation and it would be better if the Soviet Union and the United States were allied.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> hoped that this exchange of views had been useful. He would report to his Government and would take great pleasure in conveying the President’s greetings to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
<p>The President said he was glad <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had taken the trouble to come to the United States.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> expressed his thanks for the help he had had from the authorities in this country and the reception he had received from the people and the business world. The President said we would be glad to compete in hospitality.</p>

(Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/1–1659)</note> Essential point is that while we are trying to get firm political decision in principle now, using language of para D, French formulation seems to defer decision until some indefinite date in the future. British and possibly French appear prefer garrison airlift as “non-provocative” means maintaining Berlin access. It is US view that airlift is not suitable response to stoppage surface traffic. Talk about airlift may have bad psychological effect tending to lead Soviets to take tougher position on ground access.</p>
<p>If Soviets did not interfere with garrison airlift at first, issue would become increasingly clouded. If they later managed to stop airlift West would be at psychological disadvantage. Berlin stockpiles obviate necessity for immediate airlift. Therefore, airlift no solution in principle, and amounts to abandonment of ground access.</p>
<p>US seeks agreement on principle that we are willing use force to defend whatever means of access is threatened; i.e., force would be used on ground if ground access challenged and in air if air access threatened.

</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> opened the conversation by asking what press line we were planning to take on the Alsop article of Jan. 19 on Berlin.<note n="1" xml:id="d139fn1">For text of this column, in which Alsop stated that the three Western Allies were now committed to use force to keep access to Berlin open, see <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post,</hi> January 19, 1959, p. A–43.</note> He said he was worried by it and foresaw a half dozen parliamentary questions which would put the Government in an embarrassing position. He had no idea exactly how the Government would answer such questions and he had told the press people in the British Embassy to tell the press they should make no comments on the article except to refer to the Four Foreign Ministers’ Communiqué of December 14 and the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Communiqué of December 16<note n="2" xml:id="d139fn2">See <ref target="#d122fn5">footnotes 5</ref> and <ref target="#d122fn6">6, Document 122</ref>.</note> which represents the western position. They were told not to amplify on this.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied that he had not had a chance to talk about this with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> who was at the Secretary’s morning staff meeting. He thought, however, that it might be possible to go a step further and say that it was well known that we were in regular and constant consultation with our allies on the Berlin situation created by the Soviet note. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> raised the objection that this language might carry the implication of confirming the substance of the article. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> then suggested broadening the language since it was well known that we have kept our allies informed about the <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> visit. Why not speak of regular consultations on all aspects of the situation not only in respect to Berlin but to Germany as a whole created by the Soviet notes and by the <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> talks? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> said he thought that this would be all right.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> then said he has been asked by his ambassador to clarify three questions.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_284" n="284" facs="0309"/>
<p>1. What did the U.S. think of the formula which the British and the French had agreed on?<note n="3" xml:id="d139fn3">See <ref target="#d127">Document 127</ref>. On January 15 <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> that he had been instructed to propose three minor changes in this draft, but <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that the United States would have to study them since they seemed to delay reaching agreement on the principle of responding with force. (Memorandum of conversation, January 15; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/1–1559) The language was still being studied when <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> talked.</note> In this connection, he referred to his previous impression from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> that the U.S. thought this language would serve only to get us over the talks with <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> confirmed this was still our position and that we did not consider this language met the need for a prompt decision in principle as represented by the specific language of paragraph D of the contingency guidance.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> then asked about a further meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> would soon have some specific observations to make on the French formula. He inquired whether the British had completed their general study of the military aspects of the problem. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> replied that the Director of Plans of the War Office had consulted with the British Chiefs of Staff and was back in Washington again.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> then said we thought that the question whether we should assert our right of land access by force was a much broader question than the military problems of how we should implement this decision of principle. We did not think that we should get into any detailed military analysis before broad guidelines had been set.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> asked whether we had gotten replies to the questions which he understood we had put to our European Command. He wondered when we would be ready to go into tripartite discussions on the basis of these replies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied that he thought we would be ready shortly but would have to ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>. He thought he could give him some word as to another meeting in the next twenty-four hours. He then returned to the French proposal, saying that we did not find this an acceptable substitute of the position represented in Paragraph D.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> then asked whether we accepted the military studies proposed in paragraph 2 of the French draft. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> pointed out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> was afraid that if we entered into theoretical discussions of the possibility of an airlift the Soviets would get the impression that we were thinking in terms of an airlift and were not prepared to insist upon our land rights.</p>
<p>Returning to the Alsop article, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> expressed his fear that the Foreign Minister would be asked in Parliament what commitments had been made about enforcing land access rights. He thought this might precipitate trouble in the U.K. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> asked whether this wasn’t the type of question to which the Foreign Minister could reply by <pb xml:id="pg_285" n="285" facs="0310"/>stating our public position and adding that he could not discuss the details of military operations. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> said the Minister would surely be asked whether we were committed to a land operation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> pointed out that in any event a military operation would be involved and that whether we responded in the air or on the ground military operations were implicit which no one could expect us to divulge in advance. If the Foreign Minister should indicate that we are not decided to respond on the ground we might as well start moving out of Berlin right now.</p>
<p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> then recalled the tripartite agreement that nothing would be said to the Germans on these questions until we had an agreed tripartite position. He wondered whether this was still our position and asked in particular whether the subject had been touched upon in the conversations with German State Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName>.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said it was his impression that the discussions with <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> had been general and questions of this kind had not been mentioned in any detail. He then briefed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> on the basis of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>s to Bonn no. 1488 and 1517,<note n="4" xml:id="d139fn4">See the source note, <ref target="#d129">Document 129</ref>, and <ref target="#d133">Document 133</ref>.</note> which confirmed his recollection on this point.</p>
<p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> then asked what was the status of the Prime Minister’s letter to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and the British Aide-Mémoire of January 13.<note n="5" xml:id="d139fn5">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s letter, see <ref target="#d131fn10">footnote 10, Document 131</ref>. In the aide-mémoire the British noted that the Soviet note of January 10 (see <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>) seemed to present some flexibility on Berlin and that this avenue should be explored. In concluding, however, the British stated that the Western Allies should show no weakness on Berlin and make it plain that they were prepared to risk general war in support of their rights in the city. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/1–1359)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said the Secretary had a draft reply<note n="6" xml:id="d139fn6">Not further identified.</note> which had been sent to him on Friday. He was still mulling it over. He thought an answer would be going forward shortly and that this would help to bring things into focus.</p>
<p>The conversation closed with a brief discussion of the <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> visit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> said he thought that it was not to be expected that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> would make any concessions during his visit. He had thought that he had come to take the temperature of the water and return to report. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said this had been our original estimate, which had proven correct. He commented, however, that he had thought that in private conversation <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> might have been a little more reassuring on the ultimatum aspect. When finally pinned down on the question, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had made it clear the Soviets had not withdrawn their ultimatum.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_286" n="286" facs="0311"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JRW1">Jackling</persName> assumed that the Secretary had on his part made the Western position as firmly as could be. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied that he had, but he had also gone to great pains to make it clear that we understood the Soviet concern about Germany, that we had exercised restraint in East Germany and that we did not expect the Soviets to accept a settlement which would put them in a position of military disadvantage.</p>

Only difference is that they do not believe wise to agree in advance on method of implementation under unknown situation that may appear and which may be dependent on unforeseeable factors. It is his opinion that their position comes out substantially to same point as ours in that quick consultation should take place in any event before final action.</p>
<p>He emphasizes further that three governments should study various contingencies and practical measures to be taken. No indication that airlift is necessarily preferable. He did volunteer that in his judgment situation was even more grave than before <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> visit United States.</p>
<p>Simultaneously <persName corresp="#p_BJM1">Boegner</persName> reaffirmed to <gloss target="#t_EmbOff1">EmbOff</gloss> above position. He reiterated that General was determined not to give way in face of Soviet threats.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">A more detailed account of <persName corresp="#p_BJM1">Boegner</persName>’s statement was transmitted in telegram 2652 from Paris, January 20.

<p>Inasmuch as French position is so close to ours, and it would seem about as far as man such as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> responsible for security of his country will go, it is our opinion further pressure would be fruitless and we would recommend on basis of our knowledge that we refrain from further attempts at persuasion.</p>

<p>1542. Paris pass <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> and West. I had long private conversation last night with Pres. <persName corresp="#p_HT1">Heuss</persName>. He is excellent man, intellectually independent, morally superior. He said he was not free (because of his constitutional status) to express himself publicly, but held certain views on of German foreign policy which were not fundamentally at variance with those of Chancellor.</p>
<p>After querying me on <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> visit, he observed:</p>
<p>1. There must be no negotiation with Soviets on Berlin question except in larger framework, and we must continue convince them of our firmness in face of their unacceptable proposals. Could not himself now envisage suitable alternative to our present position.</p>
<p>2. We should be ready to talk to Soviets ad infinitum on any and all subjects, excepting Berlin in isolation, regardless of any expectation of constructive results.</p>
<p>3. A summit conference should not be held unless preliminary preparations indicated successful conclusions.</p>
<p>4. He did not think we should depart from current policies because accused of intransigence. In personal life, if one is opposed to murder, arson, stealing, one does not alter ethics when charged with being old-fashioned, or when change might seem momentarily opportune or tempting.</p>
<p>5. However, he thought Western Powers would make mistake in not welcoming, even initiating, conference with Soviets, and taking their chances in regard adverse propaganda. But would be unrealistic of them to enter upon such parleys with expectation of achieving propaganda victory.</p>
<p>6. Exchanges of notes, the language of which bored people, were more unfavorable to us than whatever might come from the confrontation and debate of Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>In this connection, my new Norwegian colleague lately told me he thought Westerners vastly exaggerated our inferiority to Soviets in propaganda field. He considered public opinion should be assessed in terms of political reactions. In that respect, in his own country, in France, Italy, and elsewhere in Western Europe, the power of indigenous <pb xml:id="pg_288" n="288" facs="0313"/>Communist parties had been steadily on wane. This constituted refutation of strident allegations that Western statesmen could not hold their own against Soviet diplomats.</p>

<p>3843. Paris for Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>. Though we have not recently discussed with <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> problem of para D Berlin contingency plan, it appears certain that Don Cook’s Jan 22 <hi rend="italic">Herald Tribune</hi> story<note n="1" xml:id="d144fn1">Cook’s article in the European edition of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald Tribune,</hi> January 22, reviewed the differences between the United States and the United Kingdom on the use of ground force in Berlin.</note> based on deliberate “leak” from some Brit official, presumably following Alsop story from Washington and extreme British annoyance thereover (Paris 2694 to Dept and <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3786).<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">Both dated January 22. Telegram 2694 reported that French Foreign Ministry officials deplored press speculation on Berlin. Telegram 3786 stated that the Foreign Office believed the Alsop story (see <ref target="#d139fn1">footnote 1, Document 139</ref>) was an “inspired leak,” a view that was shared by <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, who “was not amused.” (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/1–2259)</note> Would also be our judgment that Cook story in fact very well summarizes present <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> thinking on problem. Alsop and Cook stories already showing signs of generating attention and speculation British press and may even lead to questions in House of Commons, where Labour opposition seeking use every possible issue to needle govt in pre-election atmosphere now prevailing. Thus quite apart from question of useful information already given Soviets by Alsop and Cook stories, Labour may try and force <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> take public stand re surface use of force.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_290" n="290" facs="0315"/>
<p>Dilemma U.S. faces re this problem also becoming increasingly clear. We agree fully with Dept’s view that most important to avoid having Soviets get impression or information (intelligence) that West would under anticipated circumstances immediately resort to airlift rather than try force issue on ground. [<hi rend="italic">5 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] At same time, we doubt that British or French Govts (or also Germans when they are brought into discussions) are likely give us (or any other ally of theirs) advance commitment now to take specific course of action some months hence which might lead to world war III. Believe Brits likely continue insist on at least spelling out major lines of possible operational alternatives and having these vetted by military before considering giving advance commitment.</p>
<p>Further difficulty seems to be in presentation issue as clear cut “stoppage surface traffic” as suggested <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 2532 to Paris.<note n="3" xml:id="d144fn3"><ref target="#d138">Document 138</ref>.</note> Unless various Sov moves such as confronting us with different officials (<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> instead of Soviet), examining documents and other measures control overland passage to Berlin are recognized as stoppage, British seriously question whether their public opinion, or for that matter general Western European opinion can be brought to support “provocative” use of force by U.S. on ground, especially if Soviets set stage so we would have to shoot first. We would judge this British apprehension probably well founded, at least in terms public opinion as it seems at present. Question looms important what if anything can be done to educate and prepare opinion meanwhile re importance taking strong stand over “dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”, something which even many Tory MP’s in Britain do not appear comprehend as yet.</p>
<p>Will appreciate any arguments Dept can send us to use re above points. Also trust that as soon as possible our military experts will be considering with British and French (and presumably Germans as well) not only specific details and implications of use of force on ground, but also airlift problems (including technical matter of possible Soviet interference with radar controls, and effort to persuade British that Berlin people would in fact be prepared tighten belts once again in case of crisis, on which latter point British officials here seem skeptical).</p>
<p>Do not believe present British reluctance over Berlin contingency planning should be taken as indication basic weakness or softness. For when chips down, we believe British Govt and people would show determination and firmness. But as we see it, what <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> govt now concerned about is their fear that we may be heading into situation where U.S. would be urging use force with public opinion split and possibly largely negative.</p>

(Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/1–2359)</note> which will be helpful to us here. We anticipate that while British may concur point made <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> (re importance of impact on Sovs of evidence of our intention prosecute our rights of surface access), they will probably still raise other points mentioned above.</p>

<p rend="center">THINKING OUT LOUD BY <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">JOHN FOSTER DULLES</persName></p>
<p>I am particularly concerned at the diagnosis of Western European public opinion. It indicates that this public opinion would not permit the governments to risk launching a land operation merely to keep open the Western access to Berlin.</p>
<p>Perhaps access as of right, rather than at <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sufferance, seems a “minor” difference. But it is always possible for the Soviet Union to stage its demands and its probing so that each step seems a relatively little step and one for which it is not worthwhile to risk war. That of course means that the very great Soviet gains could be made merely by making them in stages and by degrees.</p>
<p>I wonder whether, if opinion is as represented, Western Europe is really defensible at all.</p>
<p>The present suggestion relates to the abdication by the Soviet Union of its agreed responsibilities and substituting the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> under conditions <pb xml:id="pg_293" n="293" facs="0318"/>which would compel us, if we acquiesce, to deal with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as a government. (I am not now speaking of possibly dealing with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials as agents of the Soviet Union which would be quite a different matter.) Such acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would greatly enhance its prestige and shore up the uncertain structure of the Soviet position in Eastern Europe. It would dismay and dishearten the population of Berlin and, I would assume, the large majority of the people of the Federal Republic. It would expose the lack of willpower in the Western alliance and encourage further pressures.</p>
<p>I do not believe that this can be treated as a relatively minor gain for the Soviet Union and only a minor loss to the Western world.</p>
<p>In my opinion the risk of war developing is minimized if the Soviet Union realizes that we are prepared to be strong and to exercise our rights. I am convinced that the striking power of the United States constitutes a genuine and effective deterrent unless the Soviets would finally calculate that there is not the moral courage to use it when necessary. Another deterring consideration is that the Soviets would not want to stir up the situation in Eastern Europe, where disloyalty and disaffection are rampant.</p>
<p>Of course, no amount of power operates as a deterrent unless there is the will to use it when so compelled by the violation of our rights. So far as we are concerned, the will is present. If so far as Western Europe is concerned, the will is lacking, then I fear our entire <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> concept and US participation in it will require drastic review.</p>
<p>I would of course agree that there should be an avoidance of preliminary measures which might inaugurate a panic. On the other hand, if it is not possible in a serious situation to take reasonable preliminary measures without a panic starting, then we are in a bad position.</p>
<p>I note the suggestion that there is a tendency in Europe to think that the United States would like to see a “showdown” in Europe, from the hazards of which the United States would be immune. I also note that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> is “not criticizing such a view if it has been expressed”. Of course the fact is, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> admits, that in the foreseeable future no aggressive despot is going to allow himself to become involved in a difficult and dangerous struggle in Europe while the power and resources of the United States remain intact. The Kaiser and Hitler did this, and paid the price. The obvious lesson has now been learned, and if the Soviets started a general European war, the United States would be hit first and hardest.</p>
<p>If a contrary view prevails in Europe, and if the Western European Governments are compelled to act on the assumption the United States wants to get them into a war on the theory that this country would be relatively immune, that again reveals a situation which gravely affects <pb xml:id="pg_294" n="294" facs="0319"/>all our common thinking and planning for the security of Western Europe.</p>
<p>I would hope that in these matters the governments which know better would be able to give leadership, rather than be led by the people who you suggest hold false ideas. And, although I would not set my judgment against Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s, I am not sure that the view is widely held in Europe that the United States is trying to provoke European war.</p>
<p>The United States has sent to Europe and maintained there a large part of its own military force, approximately 6 divisions, to say nothing of naval, air and logistic formations. The theory was to make it apparent to all, and not least of all to the people of Western Europe, that this time there could not be a European war without the United States being fully involved from the beginning. If our presence there does not serve that purpose, that again raises some questions for the future.</p>
<p>It seems to me that what the United States did with the United Kingdom in the Near East, and what the United States did in the Far East (Formosa), has served to demonstrate to all the world that the United States is not trying to assure that if war comes it will come in Europe, leaving us relatively immune. We are dedicated to peace, and to the conviction that there must be a steady and openly understood determination that as against the designs of International Communism and Soviet imperialism, only a display of strength and firmness of will can possibly maintain the peace.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom Embassy Aide-Mémoire delivered on January 13,<note n="1" xml:id="d146fn1">See <ref target="#d139fn5">footnote 5, Document 139</ref>.</note> there appears the following: “For it to be possible for this line of policy to be successfully pursued, it is, of course, essential that we should show absolutely no weakness in our determination to uphold our rights in relation to Berlin and to make it plain to the Russians that we would if necessary be prepared to risk a general war in support of these rights.” This seems to me to be eminently sound.</p>

<p>1. Department recognizes necessity eventual <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultation on Berlin contingency planning and desirability informing <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> at least in general terms as soon as Three Powers, in consultation with Federal Republic, have reached clear understanding on subject. Discussion in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> at this time, however, would not only be premature but might also have effect of tending reduce Western position on use of force maintain access to Berlin to lowest common denominator of determination.</p>
<p>2. If in interim you believe it necessary make some comment to satisfy legitimate <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interest in question, you might wish take following line:</p>
<list>
<item>A. Basic political decisions have been taken that we will maintain our access to Berlin and will not permit substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel to perform functions Soviets have exercised re this access.</item>
<item>B. Contingency planning now proceeding should be regarded as implemention of these decisions.</item>
<item>C. Discussions among Three Powers at present turn on question of what measures can most effectively maintain access, both on surface and in air, against <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> efforts assert controls over access.</item>
<item>D. Security considerations naturally prevent anything but most restricted discussion of detailed military plans. However, Three Powers fully aware of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interest and will give <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> substance of planning after plans more fully developed.</item>
<item>E. Should be borne in mind that military planning for various contingencies must be worked out well in advance and that completion of such planning does not signify plans will automatically be carried out without recourse to appropriate diplomatic measures.</item>
</list>
<p>3. Re para 3 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, language suggested by French would seem make further consultation, probably including <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultation, inevitable before decision taken to use force to maintain surface access.</p>
<p>4. Re para 4 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> we believe it essential Soviets have clear understanding our surface access to Berlin can be blocked only at risk of war. If paragraph D adopted leak of fact West had adopted firmest possible <pb xml:id="pg_296" n="296" facs="0321"/>position could thus do us no harm. On either [<hi rend="italic">other?</hi>] hand leaks to effect Western Powers not fully agreed on this or to effect British and French do not entirely share US views can give Soviets impression we may be prepared evade issue and thus induce them implement their threats against our access rather than accepting some face-saving way out of crisis. For this reason we have been concerned about recent press speculation which obviously inspired by leaks from various sources.</p>
<p>5. Any statement in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> should of course be coordinated with British, French and Germans.</p>

<p>1646. Please arrange deliver following letter from Secretary to Chancellor as soon as possible: “January 29, 1959</p>
<p>My dear Friend:</p>
<p>You have, I know, received reports from your Ambassador here of the various conversations which Soviet Deputy Premier <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Anastas Mikoyan</persName> had with the President and myself during his visit to the United States.<note n="1" xml:id="d148fn1">See <ref target="#d121">Documents 121</ref> and <ref target="#d135">135</ref>–<ref target="#d137">137</ref>.</note> I need not tell you, therefore, that at his departure the Berlin situation stood just where it did at his arrival. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> took some pains to convey by his manner an apparent willingness to be conciliatory. His actual words, however, showed no significant deviation from the Soviet position expressed orally by Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and in the Soviet notes of November 27 and January 10.<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2">See <ref target="#d72">Documents 72</ref> and <ref target="#d124">124</ref>.</note> It is true that he said the Soviet demands were not intended as an ultimatum. Nevertheless, <pb xml:id="pg_297" n="297" facs="0322"/>at no point did he hint that, failing agreement with the Western Powers by May 27, the Soviets would be deterred from turning over their responsibilities to the Pankow regime. He repeatedly asked for counter proposals on Berlin from us, but he made no new proposals of his own, nor of course did we have any to make. On our part, both the President and I impressed on <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> our flat intention to maintain our rights in Berlin.</p>
<p>The fact that nothing of great significance emerged from the talks with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> has undoubtedly disappointed many who, before his arrival, had speculated that he would bring a new and more acceptable offer from the Soviets. I cannot say that I was myself greatly surprised. As I told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DH1">Dittmann</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> on January 14,<note n="3" xml:id="d148fn3">See <ref target="#d133">Document 133</ref>.</note> it would have been contrary to the normal techniques employed by the Soviets to compromise or retreat at this early stage. They may be expected to press their demands until they have satisfied themselves that we are prepared to fight over Berlin.</p>
<p>I am inclined to believe that the Soviets have been taken somewhat aback by the firmness and unity of purpose on Berlin shown by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries during their December meeting in Paris.<note n="4" xml:id="d148fn4">See <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>.</note>It is probable that, among his purposes, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> came to the United States to assess the strength of our determination on this issue as well as the general fiber of the country. I believe that he must have returned to Moscow with no illusions on either score. The time of testing for the West, however, is still ahead. We shall need our unity and firmness over the months to come. This is the indispensable prerequisite for dispelling the crisis over Berlin which the Soviets have precipitated.</p>
<p>We are still far from fully developing a tactical position which offers some prospect for such a solution. We are also, like yourself, engaged in a review of our common position on substance to see if we can find a form of presentation more persuasive than our Geneva efforts of 1955. I think we must realistically admit that the Soviet initiative has added a new psychological element in terms of expectancies, as well as underlining the delicately poised post-war equilibrium in Central Europe. By pressing on the West’s militarily exposed nerve in Berlin, the Soviets have in fact raised in urgent form the closely related, more general problems of a European settlement. Without the reunification of Germany in freedom no such settlement nor any real solution of West Berlin can be found. I doubt that the Soviets are yet ready for any such general settlement on terms the West can accept. I am notwithstanding <pb xml:id="pg_298" n="298" facs="0323"/>convinced that we must make another effort in this direction as part of the process of dealing with the Berlin situation.</p>
<p>This, I think, means moving towards a conference with the Soviets. Providing the firmness of the Western allies remains evident, such a conference would provide the Soviets with a certain protective coloration under which they might withdraw from the dangerous position <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has taken on West Berlin. I believe you will concur that it is unlikely the Soviets will postpone their announced plans in Berlin unless provided with some such face-saving camouflage. If on the other hand the Soviets will not withdraw then a conference will demonstrate to our own peoples how faithfully we sought a peaceful solution before facing the grave risk of a resort to force to maintain our position in West Berlin.</p>
<p>I agree with you, of course, that the draft of a so-called peace treaty attached to the Soviet note of January 10 is not acceptable. Incidentally, one fairly clear impression we did receive from <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> was that, if we did not get involved in some sort of discussion, the Soviets and their satellites would proceed with the signing of a peace treaty with the Pankow regime.</p>
<p>This is another factor which makes clear that we cannot merely reject the Soviet proposal and expect them to come up with a more acceptable one. I do not think this would be either realistic or tactically sound. We would wish to avoid too much delay in getting the Soviets around a table.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, flexibility as to the agenda of such a conference would be to our advantage. We might simply say to the Soviets that it would be fruitless for either side to attempt to dictate the agenda for discussions on a subject as broad as Germany. Accordingly we might suggest that the Foreign Ministers of the four powers meet at Geneva in mid-April to discuss ‘the question of Germany’. We might further suggest something along the lines of the arrangements made at Geneva for consultation with other interested parties. In all the preparation of our position we naturally want to work closely with your representatives. However, we do not have much time, and we have welcomed the general willingness to arrange the early assembly of a four power working group in Washington to serve as focal point for an exchange of views on both tactics and substance. Its first task I suggest should be to prepare a draft reply to the Soviet note of January 10. I would visualize this reply as confined essentially to the procedural proposal which I have suggested above.</p>
<p>We have been in touch with your Foreign Office, as well as with the British and French, to suggest that such a four power working group <pb xml:id="pg_299" n="299" facs="0324"/>meet in Washington at the beginning of February and I would hope our reply to the Soviet note could go forward before the middle of February.</p>
<p>As to the content of the Western position, I am persuaded that the West would have much to gain if we could in some fashion take advantage of the great asset which the Federal Republic has in the fact that political ideals and conditions of freedom in the West attract an overwhelming percentage of the population of the Soviet Zone. We have, as you know, urged that your Government give some thought as to how we might take advantage of this fact in any discussions with the Soviets, and we are attempting to come up with some ideas on our part. If it is convenient, I would be willing, perhaps next week, to visit you in Bonn, and away from the pressure of other problems, discuss these questions with you and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> in the light of the developing situation. I would probably stop briefly at London and Paris en route.</p>
<p>I suspect you will not be surprised that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> was less than complimentary in some of his references, publicly and privately, to you personally and some of your colleagues. One of his efforts—and a spectacularly unsuccessful one—was to seek to drive a wedge between us.</p>
<p>Faithfully yours,</p>

</list>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> opened the meeting by defining the problem as twofold; first, we must decide our own policy with regard to meeting the Soviet threat to Berlin which will mature as of May 27, 1959 (the date on which the USSR turns over control of access to Berlin to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>), and second, we must determine what can be sold to our allies as a course of action on an international basis.</p>
<p>Time wise, the first problem we must face is whether we acquiesce in the turnover of control of access from the USSR to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. (Here the President confirmed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that the quadripartite control council for Berlin no longer exists.) The position of the Foreign Ministers at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council meeting in December was that we should not accept this substitution. Such acceptance would enhance the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>’s prestige. As the result, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would soon stiffen up the requirements levied upon allied forces for access to Berlin and would apply pressure gradually, without creating a situation nearly so dramatic as the initial action. We have a strong case against this turnover in that the USSR has responsibility to us in this matter and there is no reason why we should have to accept the substitution of a dummy government, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It is therefore recommended that we not accept this substitution. This recommendation is backed up by the public position which we have taken. It is only fair, however, to note that the British are wobbling in this matter.</p>
<p>The President then brought up the question of degree of provocation versus degree of response. For example, if the Soviet official at a check point is replaced by an official from the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and this <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> official requires the mere showing of a card, then this happening appears so slight that it would not, in the eyes of the world, be cause for drastic action on our part. Some way must be found to make this small action look “tremendous.” To this Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed that if a <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> official appears at a check point, and merely waves traffic through, our vehicles should not turn back. The line should be drawn, he feels, at the point where the official attempts to stamp the papers or search the trucks.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> then brought up a refinement of this point. It is his understanding that a <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> man is present at each border check point at this time, and he is responsible as a traffic officer for all commercial traffic. It is not apparent how you can avoid accepting this man as a traffic officer in order to validate the fact that any given vehicle is under military jurisdiction. On this point the President, although recognizing that we must uphold our rights as conquerors, approved the principle that U.S. traffic <pb xml:id="pg_301" n="301" facs="0326"/>going through check points manned by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel may show identification to establish that this traffic is in fact military. U.S. drivers will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> permit <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel to stamp identification papers or to search trucks.</p>
<p>The Secretary of State then continued outlining his approach. He feels that we should begin, in the near future, to effect some military preparations, which may be detected by Soviet intelligence but which are not sufficient to create public alarm. Such measures would include increasing military traffic patrols and guards on trains, etc. In this connection, the Joint Chiefs of Staff contingency plan (Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, dated January 13, 1959, subject: Berlin Situation)<note n="1" xml:id="d149fn1">See <ref target="#d122fn8">footnote 8, Document 122</ref>.</note> was recognized by Secretary. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> as an all-inclusive document, covering more measures than could in practicality be implemented. Once the substitution of a <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> official for a Soviet official has been completed, on May 27, we should then send a small armored unit to ascertain whether or not the Soviets will obstruct. If this armored unit is obstructed by some means, it should, without firing unless fired upon, return to its point of departure. We should then suspend our transit effort and mobilize world opinion against this action on the part of the Communists. Actions to do so would include bringing the matter before the Security Council of the United Nations and, in the event of Soviet use of the veto, to the General Assembly. We should also at this time proceed with further military preparedness. (This dual approach the Secretary of State refers to as the “double-barreled” approach.)</p>
<p>At this time a discussion as to the nature of this probing unit ensued, with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> answering the President’s query as to the necessity for armor in a non-resistance situation, by stating that scout cars only are anticipated and their use is contemplated primarily as protection against miscalculation. The President checked with General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> on the presence of visible armament on our convoys as of today. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> pointed out that we do not send vehicles with visible armament, or even covered trucks, through check points today. Our trained guards are present and could be augmented, but no tactical units, even of squad size, ride the trains.</p>
<p>At this time Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> defined the difference between his approach and that of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have recommended preparation for a large-scale use of force on May 27, to include meeting resistance with a large force, rebuilding of bridges, obstructions, etc. This force can comprise strength up to a division. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> would prefer to execute this operation in two stages, allowing a lapse of <pb xml:id="pg_302" n="302" facs="0327"/>time between the first probe and the use of appreciable force. To this Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> agreed.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> then spoke up in defense of the Joint Chiefs of Staff point of view. They recommend that we make up our minds now as to our sequence of action rather than attempt to address the problem only after we are stopped. (The President recognized that the wait-and see approach was also the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> approach.)</p>
<p>As a final measure, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out the necessity for starting talks on the whole German problem as of the middle of April in order to allow the Soviets the opportunity to withdraw without loss of face. The President agreed enthusiastically.</p>
<p>The President then checked on the supply levels in Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that the military in Berlin have a ninety-day level of supply. In answer to the President’s question on the civilian levels, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> estimated this to be six months. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> further pointed out that in no categories do the stocks fall below the two-months level. This satisfied the President. He then reviewed the sequence of action which involved: 1) the initial probe, which should return without resistance followed by 2) a time space in which we show more concern accompanying military preparations with action in the United Nations. He asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in this regard whether our allies will go along with this procedure. The reply was affirmative, with the Secretary stressing the stake that the Soviets have in their position before the world as a peace-loving nation. He stressed again his position that the decision to use force must not be automatic.</p>
<p>The President then turned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff contingency plan with a criticism of the size of force recommended in that plan. In the President’s view one division has insufficient capability to do an acceptable job. In the event we resort to force, we will have to conquer the entire German zone. On this matter, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed his agreement that we are risking defeat and humiliation by the use of one division. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> remarked that we are risking the same thing with an unsuccessful small convoy.</p>
<p>At this point General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> forcefully injected the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Chiefs of Staff fear that the United States will go half way and then quit. They feel that if we do not carry through with our resolution to risk general war we might as well get out of Europe. To this viewpoint the President pointed out the weakness of taking unilateral action. Without our allies we have no lines of communication and no support. In the President’s view, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ plan is designed to carry our allies with us, demonstrating that the Soviets are primarily at fault. The President feels that even <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> might not go along with a “Berlin or bust” action. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reaffirmed his own history of willingness to risk war when necessary. He stressed, however, <pb xml:id="pg_303" n="303" facs="0328"/>that in a situation of this type it is essential to give peace forces a chance to work. The first obstruction, in his view, is insufficient reason to precipitate a war. For this reason he regards extensive military preparations as the “second barrel.” There is plenty of time in his view to send a division after due contemplation.</p>
<p>A discussion then followed regarding our ground capabilities vis-à-vis those of the Soviets in Europe. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> pointed out that our policies forbid a limited war in Europe, that we cannot fight the USSR on the ground conventionally, and that if we make up our minds to go through we must be prepared to fight a general nuclear war. To this the President expressed the view that the Soviets will not interfere with direct use of force. They will, instead, use obstructions. He agrees that we do not have sufficient forces in Europe, that six equivalent divisions are not enough to do this job conventionally. Our policy must be to force the Soviets to use military force, after which we are in a position to issue an ultimatum prior to initiation of general war.</p>
<p>At Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>’s initiation, the problem of ambiguous, piecemeal tightening of restrictions was again introduced. It was reiterated at this point that we refuse to deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials at the point at which they stamp papers or search trucks. At this time, we implement Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ “double barrel.” Our position is then strong enough to take the matter to the Security Council. During this discussion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> introduced the proposal that allied guards, probably British, be prepared to step into the present Soviet check points and take over at such time as the Soviet officials are first removed. Allied convoys would then present identification to these guards rather than the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials on post. The Secretary of State replied that this idea had already been considered, but admitted that it is worthy of further consideration. The President agreed that there is some merit in this proposal.</p>
<p>The President then outlined his concern over our position with relation to public opinion. He pointed out that we must realize that we have in many ways already recognized two Germanies. He and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed that the public opinion for firm action is at this moment solid, but he is concerned about the “nibbling” problem, in which the man in the street is likely to question why we worry about the shape of the helmet of the official to whom we present credentials. He and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed on the cleverness of the Soviets in their facility in working the West into a state of tension, only to release the pressure for a period of about thirty days. The President pointed out that the United. States would <hi rend="italic">like</hi> to think that public opinion <hi rend="italic">pushes</hi> us into war. Under circumstances which might be created he is not so sure they would even <hi rend="italic">follow</hi> us into war. To set the climate of public opinion right, we must preach 1) the rights of the occupying powers, and 2) our responsibility to two million Berliners.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_304" n="304" facs="0329"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then brought up the timing of evacuation of dependents from Berlin. In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ view, this should be done at some stage after the initial effort—i.e. in the “double barrel” stage. In answer to the President’s question as to the number of dependents in Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> estimated that there are approximately twelve thousand. Although there are only four thousand military personnel, there are a great number of civilians who are not actually dependents. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> assumes that we will evacuate all noncombatants.</p>
<p>The President then inquired regarding the ability of Templehof Airfield to take our largest jets. (General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said he would check.) The President expressed a view that sending in about ten B–58s on a normal routine training flight properly announced would have a salutary effect psychologically. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated doubt in this matter as to the permissibility of jets in the Berlin corridor, primarily because of the ability of jets to stay in the landing pattern. In answer to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName>’ proposal that we send in Globemasters, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> voiced an objection that such action might give the impression that we are preparing for an airlift. Above all, he considers it essential to avoid this since Berlin cannot be kept going today, as in 1948, by an airlift. People could be fed but the economy would shrivel up and the city would lose its vitality. In this way the Soviet goals would be accomplished. With this, the President temporarily gave up his idea of sending B–58s into Berlin. He stated that they might fly along the border but then apparently overtook this idea with that of an air show (including 2.0 mach B–58s) over Washington on Lincoln’s Birthday. He feels that the intense speed of these aircraft would make a great impression.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then brought up a matter related to feasibility of an airlift. On the advice of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, he pointed out that thus far there has been no suggestion of a total blockade which would include civilian traffic, implying that Berlin might not shrivel up if only military needs were to be met by airlift. This revelation appeared to open a new viewpoint to the President. He stated that this now is obviously a direct challenge to the Big Three and such a differentiation between civilian and military traffic might be designed to split off Germany from the others.</p>
<p>By way of summary, the President stated that the scheme as set forth by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> is generally the best way to start. However, in developing this scheme, the Secretary of State will staff out for further consideration the proposal of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> with regard to substituting allied guards for Soviets when the substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials is attempted. In the meantime, it is essential to find out whether there is a possibility of discussing the entire German problem with the Soviets. (In this connection he mentioned the idea of Berlin as a location for the talks.) He instructed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to start now to determine under which particular conditions our allies will go along with this. (Secretary <pb xml:id="pg_305" n="305" facs="0330"/><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> assured the President that his program would be satisfactory to the French; indeed, it was based on a French paper.) In the event that the Soviets carry through with their threats, we will utilize gradual steps to allow for the breakdown. We will withdraw our Ambassador, then break relations and, if necessary, resort to major armed force. He desires to be logical and moderate in our approach, to build up a cover when the time comes, and to make maximum utilization of a show of military force to indicate to the Soviets our seriousness in this matter.</p>
<p>As the meeting closed, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Willy Brandt</persName> of Berlin will be here soon and that all efforts will be made by way of a hero’s welcome to indicate the solidarity of U.S. opinion, and, therefore, our seriousness in the situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">See <ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>.</note> This idea brought forth considerable enthusiasm from the President, who desires that we explore the possibilities of utilizing <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>’s visit to show off our new equipment. One means might be the provision of a fighter escort of B–58s for <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>’s air trip between Washington and New York.</p>

<p rend="center">CONCLUSIONS OF WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE RE BERLIN</p>
<p>1. We do not acquiesce in the substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for Soviet officials as regards the Western occupying powers’ movements to and from West Berlin.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_306" n="306" facs="0331"/>
<p>If <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials merely demand identification of the vehicles as those of one of the Western occupying powers, such identification will be provided. However, no stamping of papers or inspection will be acquiesced in.</p>
<p>2. Begin promptly quiet preparatory and precautionary military measures in West Germany and Berlin of a kind that would be detectable by Soviet intelligence but which would not create public alarm.</p>
<p>3. After the attempted or announced substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for USSR, the next unit to go through would be a truck or trucks accompanied by a scout car or some other vehicle with a capability for shooting. This unit, subject to the conditions mentioned in 1 above, would attempt to make the transit from Berlin. If the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or the Soviets interposed physical obstructions, then the effort would be discontinued and in no event would the armament be used unless it were fired upon, in which case it would take whatever defensive action seemed necessary.</p>
<p>4. After the physical obstruction occurred, transit would be suspended for the time being and parallel efforts would be made along the following lines:</p>
<list>
<item>a) Seek to mobilize world opinion against the Soviet Union as a violator of agreements, a user of force and a threat to the peace. The situation could be taken to the Security Council and, in the event of veto there, to a special session of the General Assembly;</item>
<item>b) Military preparations would be intensified and at this point could include measures which would be observable, as, for example, the evacuation of dependents from West Berlin, and possibly from Germany.</item>
</list>
<p>5. The decision to use additional force would be subject to governmental decision in the event that the double barreled effort mentioned above was not successful.</p>
<p>(Consideration would be given to the possibility of the stationing of Western allied inspectors in lieu of the withdrawn Soviet inspectors at the check points.)</p>
<p>6. Concurrently with the development of the foregoing program an effort would be made to bring about around the middle of April a Foreign Ministers’ meeting with the Soviet Union on the various aspects of the German question. These talks might provide a cover which would facilitate the indefinite postponement or modification by the Soviet Union of their present ultimatum as regards Berlin.</p>
<p>(It is assumed that allied agreement would be obtainable along these lines. If not the question of U.S. action would have to be considered in the light of the allied position.)</p>

<p>The present situation is characterized by the fact that the Soviet Union, now as before, aims at dominating the world by means of communism under the leadership of the Soviet Union. In official Soviet speeches the term “socialist world system” has recently been substituted for the term “socialist camp”. The Soviets regard the United States as their only significant opponent. Germany is not regarded by them as an opponent of importance. This was explicitly stated to Lippmann by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in his well-known interview of 24 October 1958.<note n="1" xml:id="d151fn1">See Walter Lippmann, <hi rend="italic">The Communist World and Ours</hi>, Boston, 1959, pp. 11–31.</note></p>
<p>2. Therefore in taking any action in respect of the Soviet Union, including any proposals that might be made shortly concerning pending questions, that objective of Soviet Russian policy must be taken into account. The free world has constantly underestimated the systematic and far-sighted quality of Soviet Russian policy. Ever since the second World War, the Government of the Soviet Union has pursued a policy deliberately aiming at world domination. After the collapse of Germany the Soviet Union was the only country which instead of disarming continuously increased its armed strength. The offer made by the United States in 1946 and subsequent years to subject all nuclear weapons to international control was sabotaged by the Soviet Union although the latter at the time did not possess any nuclear weapons. Since 1945 the Soviets have incorporated into their orbit of power the present satellite countries. After that they initiated political and economic actions of the most different kinds in numerous parts of the world. All these measures accorded with each other, and all of them pursued one and the same objective, namely, to expand the power of communism. Indeed, the Soviets and, in particular, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> have unambiguously stated again and again that communism would supersede the so-called capitalist States.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_308" n="308" facs="0333"/>
<p>To judge the situation now brought about by the Soviets only under the aspect of the partition of Germany, as is done in Britain and particularly in the United States, is incorrect and therefore leads to erroneous conclusions. The partition of Germany is not the cause but the consequence of the tension which originated between the Soviet Union and the United States before that partition. Even if Germany unity were restored in complete freedom, a state of tension between East and West would continue to exist. Germany’s independence from East and West would even be bound to intensify the tension. In view of Germany’s geographical position, both sides would have to make every effort in order to prevent her manpower and her production capacity from coming under the influence of the other side.</p>
<p>[Here follows unrelated material.]</p>
<p>4. In my view the raising of the German problem at this juncture is an attempt by the Soviet Union, to be taken very seriously, to initiate successfully the economic usurpation of Western Europe by first detaching the Federal Republic economically from the European Economic Community and later integrating it into the economic area controlled by the Soviets. The Soviet draft of a so-called peace treaty therefore logically contains provisions to the effect</p>
<list>
<item>a) that the Soviet-dominated so-called German Democratic Republic should be recognized as a German State enjoying full sovereignty, and that its territory should be guaranteed;</item>
<item>b) that the Federal Republic should enter into a confederation with that structure built on communist principles; and</item>
<item>c) that the Federal Republic should be forced to renounce any aspirations towards integration with the West.</item>
</list><p>The intention to detach the Federal Republic from the treaty system of the free nations is clearly borne out by</p>
<p>the prohibition to participate in military alliances, which would mean leaving <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>;</p>
<list>
<item>the provisions concerning the recognition of “the full sovereignty of the German people over Germany”, which prohibit the transfer of sovereign rights to European organizations; and</item>
<item>more particularly the clauses concerning most favoured nation treatment to be granted to the Soviet Union, which would preclude the further participation of the Federal Republic in the European Economic Community, the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and the GATT.</item>
</list><p>The same conditions are to apply later to a reunited Germany.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> as well as <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Grotewohl</persName> have clearly and unequivocally stated that it is the purpose of the proposed confederation to establish the rule of communism throughout Germany. In his report during the Fourth Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> said that the time has come “for the workers of West Germany <pb xml:id="pg_309" n="309" facs="0334"/>to take into their own hands the cause of peace and of the struggle against German militarism”. On 25 January <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Grotewohl</persName> stated in Peking that “the red flag of the working class would one day fly over the whole of Germany”.</p>
<p>5. It results from the above that it is impossible to agree to any proposal, irrespective of where it comes from, which brings the Soviets nearer to their objective of becoming the world’s paramount economic Power. From this follows</p>
<list>
<item>a) that the spread of communism in the Federal Republic must not under any circumstances be facilitated;</item>
<item>b) that the present connexion of the Federal Republic with the West must not be weakened in any way under any circumstances. The withdrawal of the Federal Republic from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, or from the European Communities, the abandonment of Berlin or the implementation of isolated disengagement plans would decisively weaken <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and thus be bound to result in upsetting the military and political equilibrium in favour of the Soviet Union.</item>
</list><p>[Here follows unrelated material.]</p>
<p>10. It seems to me necessary to resume, within the framework of the United Nations, the disarmament negotiations which at the time almost reached a conclusion in the subcommittee of the Disarmament Commission at London, and to link them up with the Soviet Russian move concerning Berlin and Germany.</p>
<p>11. In characterizing the partition of Germany as the most dangerous fact of our time one deflects public attention from the real threat, namely, the expansive urge of the Soviet Union. The activities of all the free nations should, however, be first and foremost directed towards preventing the expansion of communism in the world and more particularly the expansion of the economic and political power of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Once the Soviet Union realizes that she can make no further advance in her attempt at world domination, once her fear of being attacked is allayed by controlled disarmament in the field of nuclear and conventional weapons and by simultaneously pointing out to her the prospects of an undisturbed economic development in her own country, facilitated by extensive disarmament, a relaxation of tension is likely to occur throughout the world. In an atmosphere of relaxation other questions, for instance the reunification of Germany, could be negotiated about with some prospect of success. The constant arguments with the “Group of Traitors” gathering round Malenkov, Bulganin, Molotov etc. as well as the discussions of the so-called reform of the school system show that communism, too, is faced with internal problems. A relaxation of tension might promote these quarrels.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_310" n="310" facs="0335"/>
<p>In constantly characterizing the reunification of Germany as the most important problem one conjures up the danger of a movement being launched in certain countries to the effect that the world should not be imperilled for the sake of reuniting Germany. Such a movement would be ominous.</p>
<p>Since the time has not yet come to solve this question, the West runs the risk of being defeated in pursuing such a policy. It exposes itself to the danger of suffering a severe loss of prestige and conversely contributes to raising the prestige of the Soviet Union throughout the world.</p>
<p>12. In declarations, correspondence, etc. of the Western allies mention is frequently made of “European security”. Today’s armaments technology, e.g., rockets, as well as the political ties which are becoming ever closer, particularly between the communist countries and Soviet Russia, no longer admit of an isolated European security; there is only <hi rend="italic">one security</hi>, namely, the joint security of all the free nations.</p>
<p>13. There will have to be negotiations. In the course of such negotiations consideration might at the suggestion of the United States be given to the establishment of diplomatic relations by the Federal Republic of Germany with Poland and Czechoslovakia, provided that the Berlin question is solved properly. Consideration might also be given to the issue of a carefully formulated statement concerning the Oder–Neisse line, as previously, which might contain such points as the renunciation of the use of force, the maintenance of the right of people to their homeland, and perhaps economic cooperation.</p>
<p>The possibility might also be considered of negotiating an agreement on the maintenance of the status quo of Berlin for a certain period, simultaneously providing that the conditions in the Soviet Zone be improved by means of an agreed form of international control or influence. This might perhaps also benefit the negotiations concerning controlled disarmament.</p>

<head>152. Editorial Note</head>
<p>At 12:30 a.m. (7:30 a.m. in Washington) on February 2 a U.S. military convoy of four trucks from Berlin was detained at the Marienborn checkpoint by Soviet officials for refusing to submit to inspection. Protests to the Soviet Commandant’s office at Karlshorst and to the Soviet Military Mission at Frankfort failed to elicit any positive response. On the evening of February 3 the Department of State transmitted <pb xml:id="pg_311" n="311" facs="0336"/>to the Embassy in Moscow a note protesting the “unwarranted and inadmissible” detention of the convoy. (Telegram 1182; Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/2–359) Since the convoy had not been released by the following day, the note was delivered to the Foreign Ministry at 4:30 p.m. (10:30 a.m. in Washington). At the time that the note was delivered President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, who had been kept advised of the situation, reviewed the U.S. position on convoy inspection at a press conference. For text of the protest note and the President’s statement, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1959</hi>, pages 609–611.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> finally agreed to meet U.S. Political Adviser <persName corresp="#p_BFJ1">Burns</persName> at Marienborn at 4:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. in Washington) on February 4 to discuss a resolution of the problem. During a 2-1/2-hour meeting <persName corresp="#p_MLCMF1">Markushin</persName> agreed to release the convoy, but only as a personal favor to <persName corresp="#p_BFJ1">Burns</persName>.

</list>
<p>The French Ambassador stated that he had seen General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> last week and had found him absolutely firm on the Berlin issue. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De <pb xml:id="pg_312" n="312" facs="0337"/>Gaulle</persName> believed that the Western powers should use every means necessary—not excluding force—to maintain free access to Berlin and that this position should be made known to the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> felt that if the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authorities were to insist on our presenting documents at control points, we should refuse to comply and continue on through to Berlin. Similarly if obstacles were erected, they should be removed and we should proceed to Berlin. General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> felt, however, that we should not be provocative or be the first to use force.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> stated he thought it would be useful for the Secretary when in Paris to explain to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> his views regarding an air lift. He felt that if an air lift were considered no more than a tentative possibility, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> would understand.</p>
<p>Regarding a foreign ministers conference, the Ambassador stated that General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> felt very strongly that we should not propose a specific date in our reply to the Soviets and certainly not a date prior to May 27. To do so, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> felt, would be a sign of weakness and an indication that we were desperately seeking a compromise solution. Despite the foregoing, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> was disposed to having talks with the Soviets and in fact hoped that there would be a conference on the overall issues affecting Germany. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> did not believe that we should consider recognizing the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, but he thought it might prove feasible to arrive at a modus vivendi which would involve de facto relations between the Federal Republic and the Western powers on the one hand and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> on the other.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> stated that the French realized that the official U.S. position on Germany was absolutely firm, but at the same time they regretted the current press speculation to the effect that the U.S. position was flexible and that discussions with Congressional leaders had indicated a willingness on the part of the U.S. Government to accept alternative solutions for Germany including something along the lines of the Rapacki plan. The French felt that these rumors gave an unfortunate impression of hesitation and disunity on the part of the West. For this reason the French welcomed all the more the Secretary’s imminent visit to London, Paris and Bonn.</p>
<p>The Secretary stated he did not think there was any disposition in the country to be anything but firm on Berlin; however, it was more difficult when it came to the precise actions to be taken. He felt there was a danger that the Western position might be “nibbled away” by reluctance on our part to stand firm on apparently minor points that might not appear worth making an issue of. He believed, however, that we had a sound position, which could be dramatized, in maintaining that for one of the German victors, namely the Soviet Union, to turn over to the defeated element controls affecting the other victors was intolerable. Technically there was still a state of war with Germany. We should <pb xml:id="pg_313" n="313" facs="0338"/>accordingly not accept substitution of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authorities for the Soviet authorities on control of access to Berlin. We would be willing to identify ourselves at control points, but we would not accept control or inspection by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authorities. Details as to the precise actions that might be necessary would require further study.</p>
<p>Regarding the date for a possible foreign ministers conference, the Secretary said that it has not been our opinion that suggesting a date prior to May 27 might be interpreted as a sign of weakness, particuarly in view of the fact that as of last September 30,<note n="1" xml:id="d153fn1">For text of the Western notes of September 30, 1958, proposing the establishment of a four-power working group to draft a solution to the German problem, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1958</hi>, pp. 584–587.</note> we had already suggested a conference with the Soviets on German reunification and European security. Moreover, irrespective of the Soviet proposals, we would not be disposed to limit the agenda solely to discussion of the Berlin issue. Nevertheless, the Secretary stated in our reply to the Soviets it might be preferable to propose holding a conference “at a mutually satisfactory time and place”.</p>
<p>The French Ambassador stated this was the wording in the French draft reply.<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">This draft was delivered to the Department on January 28 and transmitted to the Embassy in Paris in telegram 2683 the same day. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/1–2859)</note> Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had told him that if the Soviets came back with a subsequent reply suggesting a date prior to May 27, he would then have no objection to accepting such a date.</p>
<p>The Secretary mentioned the likelihood that as a result of our proposing a conference on Germany and European security, the Soviets might raise the issue of composition at such a conference. He added that he had just received a letter from Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">See <ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note> saying he thought it would be undesirable to focus the conference on the issue of German reunification. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> thought if we did this, public pressures would mount for settling this question, even on unfavorable terms, under the illusion that this would resolve all outstanding East-West issues. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> accordingly preferred that the principal subject for a conference be disarmament.</p>
<p>The French Ambassador thought that taking such a line would be unrealistic. The Secretary said he was inclined to agree, particularly in view of the fact that the current nuclear test suspension conference in Geneva was on the verge of collapse. In this connection, the Secretary stated, he thought the Soviet position insisting on unanimity for the control commission was ludicrous. It tended to confirm his earlier impression that the Soviets would be unwilling to accept genuine controls.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_314" n="314" facs="0339"/>
<p>In conclusion the Secretary stated that he thought the French and U.S. positions were close together and agreement should be able to be reached between them on these matters. M. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> concurred, but stated he thought the British position was less firm. The Secretary agreed and mentioned that he had heard a news broadcast to the effect that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> might visit Moscow.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 4. During meeting late this afternoon at <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> discussed principally Berlin and related problems. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said it seemed Western powers were in state of disarray in development their positions. However <persName corresp="#p_SAHV1">van Scherpenberg</persName> on Thursday<note n="1" xml:id="d157fn1">January 29.</note> had given British impression that Federal Republic prepared to show some flexibility on such issues as frontiers and areas of limited armament. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> noted that he opposed agreement on latter point if it involved discrimination against foreign troops, but thought that concept area of controlled limitation had merit.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_FonSec1">FonSec</gloss> outlined British view that meeting with Soviets should take place late April or early May, that note to Soviets should suggest specific time and place, and that further meeting 4 Foreign Ministers (presumably at time <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting) would be necessary before Western substantive position formulated.</p>
<p>Secretary said problem seemed to fall into two parts: (a) Berlin and what Western powers should do if Soviets proceeded to hand control of access over to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>; (b) what Western powers did about possible negotiations with Soviets and how and when they should try to bring these about. Re date of meeting he indicated it desirable to start before May 27. French, however, did not share this view. In conversation yesterday Secretary with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">See <ref target="#d153">Document 153</ref>.</note> latter reiterated point <pb xml:id="pg_318" n="318" facs="0343"/>that asking for meeting before May 27 would be sign of weakness. Secretary said he had agreed to accept either naming of date in note to Soviets, or merely saying that date and place should be mutually agreed, leaving specific arrangements to Ambassadors. Advantage of meeting with Soviets before May 27, Secretary continued, was that it might provide Soviets with way out of their extreme Berlin position if they wanted to find it. If meeting were held Western powers would face many problems, both substantive and procedural.</p>
<p>Re substance, Secretary said he thought Western position might be basically same as that of November 1955,<note n="3" xml:id="d157fn3">Documentation on the Geneva Foreign Ministers Meeting, October 27–November 16, 1955, is in <ref target="frus1955-57v05"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, vol. V</ref>, pp. 632 ff.</note> though it could be embellished to some extent. Actually Western powers had never been able to get across merits their position. Molotov had clearly put them on defensive by misrepresenting proposals at outset. US was prepared to consider thinning out of forces, giving considerable weight to military views as to desirability, but agreed there should be no discrimination either as to foreign troops or as to country covered. Our thesis is that no nation today is strong enough to protect its own security; countries must help each other. If we admit that foreign troops in Germany are per se evil, then the whole concept would be undermined. Thinning out could therefore be considered, but not elimination of foreign forces. In general if discriminatory provisions were applied to Germany in any settlement, we would again reap consequences similar to those of Versailles. Some formulation which still kept portion of our forces in Germany and which was broader than Germany in application, preferably broader than Poland and Czechoslovakia as well, might be considered.</p>
<p>After <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had stated that one of basic questions was whether Germans really wanted reunification or not, Secretary referred to letter he had just received from <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d157fn4"><ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note> He described it as essentially devoted to lengthy argument as to why Western powers should not concentrate on reunification.</p>
<p>Secretary noted that reasoning was quite fallacious. Point emphasized that partition of Germany was not cause but effect of present tensions. It was scarcely necessary to emphasize this to Western powers. However Chancellor drew conclusion that because they allegedly held this view they were under great pressure to pay too big price for German reunification which theoretically would solve all world problems. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> commented that, out of loyalty to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, Western powers had been saying, somewhat tongue in cheek, that division of Germany is basic cause of tensions. Secretary noted that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> took position that we should almost drop German question and concentrate on disarmament.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_319" n="319" facs="0344"/>
<p>After our two recent experiences at Geneva we do not feel that this is a particularly fruitful field at present time. Attempt to shift entire attention to disarmament field would be futile. We could not get away from problem which Soviets were posing, making Germany and Berlin focal point.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> commented that this consonant with what <persName corresp="#p_SAHV1">Scherpenberg</persName> said. Latter said re reunification that all that was needed was a little light at end of long tunnel. However any neutralization formula was unacceptable, and most Germans saw this.</p>
<p>After <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had noted that <persName corresp="#p_SAHV1">Scherpenberg</persName> had indicated some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> interest in Berlin might be useful Secretary said he believed that once troops of three Western powers left Berlin game would be up. At least people of West Berlin felt that way. He mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> was arriving in US next week, and would undoubtedly have effect on American opinion. Secretary said that talk about <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> involved resort to vague formula. It was not corporate body with forces of its own. If agreement could be reached that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would designate three Western powers to act for it in Berlin, that would be satisfactory, but Soviets could hardly accept. He added that one could conceivably find <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops to replace Western forces. This would be difficult to arrange. Berliners might have sufficient confidence if these forces had adequate strength with clear mandate, but experience proved <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces tended to disintegrate.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he regarded <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> aspect as essentially move in game. He could not see it as effective, but idea that whole of Berlin might be under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> tutelage with guarantee of access had appeal. Soviets probably could not accept. During discussion possibility <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> guarantee, Secretary noted that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as such could not give guarantee.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_JSHMG1">Jebb</persName> who also present noted that under Article 51 of Charter members would be in position to take such action as deemed desirable. Secretary reiterated that he did not see any real practical substitute to having our troops in Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had emphasized that East Berlin belonged to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and could not be included in any plan. Best to hope for was that Soviets would allow their Berlin proposals to lapse.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then asked to hear latest thinking re contingency plans. He noted that in case Quemoy–Matsu British were able to help by focusing on issue improper use of force by Red Chinese. In recent instance problem was to make certain issue selected was one public would support.</p>
<p>Secretary noted that there had been some differences in US Government as to how to deal with problem. Some wanted to start right away with military preparations of far-reaching character. He was inclined to doubt wisdom of these, but would go along, if European Allies desired them. However paper threat to do this, especially if negotiations envisaged, would not work. He doubted that military measures should be <pb xml:id="pg_320" n="320" facs="0345"/>taken before May 27 which would disturb public, such as evacuation of dependents, partial mobilization in US, etc. This seemed premature until there had been some overt Soviet act. Secretary was inclined to think that Western powers might take some preliminary measures Soviet intelligence could pick up but which did not attract public attention.</p>
<p>Secretary stressed his belief that we should not accept substitution <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials for Soviets at check points. Such acceptance would constitute crossing Rubicon. Once we had done this, a whittling down process would begin moving inevitably towards acceptance authority of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. We must adhere to position that we are in Berlin as victors. If <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> allowed to exercise controls over us it would substantially undermine foundation our position.</p>
<p>Secretary noted that, under American concept, if it developed that Western attempt to send military truck through accompanied by scout car or by <gloss target="#t_MP1">MP</gloss>s were prevented, either by shooting or by obstruction then effort would be dropped at that point and we would move into second double-barrelled phase of political offensive and military preparation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said British had not yet made up their minds, but stressed that they could not see how Allies could have expanding military action without taking certain military preparatory measures. If you did not do latter Soviets would know West was bluffing. He felt air lift should be kept in reserve. If plane were shot down this would present clear issue.</p>
<p>Secretary said we did not like airlift concept. When <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> queried whether this applied to garrison air lift, Secretary noted that garrison had ample stocks for provisional period. If civil traffic were stopped, that would be another matter. Complete blockade would raise new issues. Situation in Berlin was different than in 1948, apart from Soviet jamming capabilities.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_SAHV1">Scherpenberg</persName> expressed belief <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would not want to stop Allied traffic initially, but would gradually convert into attempt to impose controls.</p>
<p>Secretary said it was important to see purpose behind Soviet moves. They wished minimize psychological effect of free Berlin. He had been impressed on visit last May with dynamic nature West sectors. This was contrast with unpopular regime in East Germany. Discussion Berlin ended with remark by <persName corresp="#p_HM1">Hoyer Millar</persName> who also present that one concession West might make would be to cut down propaganda and related activities in West Berlin.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 3. Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, accompanied by small number advisers, discussed Berlin and Germany this evening. On shortterm aspects there was agreement on many details. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, however, seemed more preoccupied with what he called long-term possibilities in Europe. On this <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> noted that his thinking was far ahead of that of Foreign Office. Re short-term, Secretary repeated views he had expressed earlier in day to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> (<gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 4)<note n="1" xml:id="d158fn1"><ref target="#d157">Document 157</ref>.</note> on drawing issue with Soviets at attempted substitution <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for Soviet control over Allied access to Berlin, and successive military and political steps to be taken if <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> attempts physical obstruction of access. British did not disagree. There was casual reference to possibility “agent theory”<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">See <ref target="#d68">Document 68</ref>.</note> might one day be accepted if Soviets acknowledged it. Secretary expressed his conviction the Soviets do not want to go to war over Berlin issue but we must be careful not to put them into a position where they feel they have to.</p>
<p>Considerable discussion of timing and substance of conference with Soviets reflected agreement that there should be one, that it should be in session on May 27 and therefore should probably not start until early May, and that it should be preceded by conference of Western Four at Foreign Minister or even Heads of Government level at least as to UK, France and Germany. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> felt this latter conference in turn should be preceded by his visiting Washington to meet President after his visits to Moscow, Bonn and Paris; middle March was a suggestion. Agreed April <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting Foreign Ministers might provide opportunity for concerting position.</p>
<p>On substance, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> felt that, although sweeping new proposals might not be ready before conferences envisaged, we should attempt to provide long-term context for our own thinking. His premises were that West Germans are not so keen on reunification as our present policy subsumes; [<hi rend="italic">5 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. Although, in the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> thesis, the status quo in Europe may suit US and the West Germans and the Soviets, we should consider whether an inspected “thinning <pb xml:id="pg_322" n="322" facs="0347"/>out” of forces in Europe might not be an advantageous proposal, as long as it involved no discrimination nationality or force wise. He thought that if the area in Europe encompassed in such a scheme was large enough it might eventually lead to the sort of reunification of Germany with which we could live, especially if it would get the Red Army back into the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> argued further that his idea would, if it worked, be a major gain in detaching the Communist claws from a significant area, a detachment which in his view would have important political and ideological reverberance to the disadvantage of Moscow.</p>
<p>Secretary expressed skepticism that the military and political risks involved in these proposals would be acceptable. He and <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> weighed the risks of attempting a “thinning out” based on the status quo and of acquiescing in the long-term division of Germany. There was no agreed conclusion on these “long-term” matters.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of the Ambassador, I referred to stories indicating that the Prime Minister’s projected trip to Moscow had been discussed in advance with me and approved by me. I said I thought that it was undesirable that his statement to the House should contain such implications since, as he knew, I had considerable reservations about the wisdom of the trip at this time. Also it would create embarrassments with our other allies. The Prime Minister said that he would merely state that we, with others, had been informed in advance and not indicate that we had been earlier informed in advance.<note n="1" xml:id="d159fn1">For text of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s statement to the House of Commons, February 5, see 599 House of Commons, <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Debates</hi>, 5th Series, cols. 577–578.</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_323" n="323" facs="0348"/>
<p>With reference to the Berlin situation, I indicated that the program of contingency reaction which I had outlined represented in my opinion the most moderate program that the United States would find acceptable. I pointed out that it fell considerably short of what the Defense Department and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had recommended. I said that if American public opinion got the impression that the Soviet Union had gained a considerable victory in Berlin as a result of pressures upon us by our allies, I thought the reaction on our European policy would be serious and it might affect our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> posture.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 4. Eyes only Acting Secretary for President from Secretary.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>I have just arrived in Paris having concluded the London phase of my trip. Jock, <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Livie</persName> and I spent last evening with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and one or two of their advisers.<note n="1" xml:id="d160fn1">See <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note> Then this morning I spent an hour at the Foreign Office at a meeting which included <persName corresp="#p_OGWD1">Ormsby–Gore</persName>, the UK head negotiator at the suspension of testing talks at Geneva.<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reported on the meeting at the Foreign Office in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss>s 8, 9, 10, and 11 from London, February 5. (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1203)</note> The Government had called him back to London for this purpose.</p>
<p>Then we went over to 10 Downing Street and the Prime Minister joined our talks for an hour.<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">A more detailed report on the meeting at 10 Downing Street was transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 13 from Paris, February 5. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 762.00/2–559)</note></p>
<p>The Prime Minister indicated that our Presidentially approved program for dealing with a Soviet turn-over of Berlin authority to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> <pb xml:id="pg_324" n="324" facs="0349"/>was generally acceptable. It was, however, easy to detect a disposition on their part to be prepared to recognize or deal with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in this matter. Their general attitude in this whole affair is by our standards “softer”.</p>
<p>Last night the Prime Minister talked in a rather rambling way about a possible program which would involve semi-permanent acceptance of the partition of Germany and then a thinning out of forces in the general Central European area.<note n="4" xml:id="d160fn4">See <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note></p>
<p>[Here follow two paragraphs on the suspension of nuclear testing.]</p>
<p>With respect to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName>’s “solitary pilgrimage” to Moscow some of the London papers have been giving the impression that we had been consulted and had approved of this trip and there were indications that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> might so indicate in his statement this afternoon to the House. I asked him not to do this pointing out that we had of course had considerable reservations about the wisdom and timeliness of the trip. Also that it would be embarrassing in our relations with the French and Germans to indicate that we had had a special rank in consultation ahead of them. So the Prime Minister promised he would merely state that we among others had been informed in advance.<note n="5" xml:id="d160fn5">See <ref target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note></p>
<p>In general I found this talk with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName> less satisfactory than our usual talks. He seemed to be preoccupied with other matters, perhaps the electoral situation, and he was vague and rambling and indecisive.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I shall be meeting with the great General and probably encounter plenty of decisiveness, although perhaps not precisely the kind we would like.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 14. Discussion this morning at <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> between Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> devoted largely to Berlin and related problems. Secretary noted that preliminary exchange of views at this time would be useful to prevent hardening of Allied positions in different directions. He felt gravity of move by Soviet Union as threat to security of German Government and free world should not be minimized. He had impression that thinking of Western Powers was running along parallel lines but wanted to confirm this. Perhaps there was some difference in approach by UK and <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>.</p>
<p>Secretary analyzed problem facing Western powers along lines para 3 <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 4 from London.<note n="1" xml:id="d161fn1"><ref target="#d157">Document 157</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he agreed West should not underestimate gravity of issues faced. He pointed out that public opinion tended to expect that somehow arrangements would be made and that problem would dissolve in air. This was dangerous state of mind. He did not know why Soviets had raised Berlin problem as they had, but saw nothing since end of November indicating any basic change in intention to turn responsibilities over to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>Re contingency plans, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said Western powers must start from principle they cannot accept interference their communications to Berlin either by air or land. This should be affirmed clearly. When May 27 arrived they would have to see what best course of action would be, whether it better to resort to airlift or to insistence on land access. However, decision must be taken to do whatever necessary to maintain Western communications. Secretary then outlined in detail US views (along lines reported <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 4) on dealing with problem presented by Soviets’ handing over control of access to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that in general French agreed with US approach. Secretary noted he had discussed with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">See <ref target="#d157">Documents 157</ref> and <ref target="#d158">158</ref>.</note> They likewise had agreed in general but appeared more disposed than US to accept substitution <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials for Soviets. Secretary stressed his belief that acceptance such substitution would be tantamount to abandoning basic principle that our victor’s rights in Berlin cannot be handed over by <pb xml:id="pg_326" n="326" facs="0351"/>Soviets to vanquished. Western powers do not allow either <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> to exercise controls over their rights re Berlin. At time of Paris Agreements, when certain aspects of sovereignty restored to <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>, three powers reserved their rights re Berlin. This was important question of principle. Once we conceded that Soviets could turn over their obligations to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, we could not prevent creeping imposition of controls.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed it was essential Western powers retain rights deriving from German surrender. Integral part of these rights in Berlin was freedom of communications with city. We cannot concede that Soviets could give up their responsibilities. Whether they could be “adapted” was another problem. Secretary commented that if Soviets wanted to specify <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials as their agents that could be discussed and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed. Secretary stressed his belief that Western powers could exert real pressure on Soviet Union by bringing matter to Security Council or special session of General Assembly. Soviets now had considerable investment in respectability. Placing them in position where it clearly demonstrable they had violated agreements could have considerable impact.</p>
<p>As to precise conduct at checkpoints if <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials present, Secretary explained we proposed only to take sufficient action to prove identity of vehicles as Allied and not German. In response to query, Secretary indicated British were in agreement but would probably again raise question of permitting extensions by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials such as allowing placing of time stamp on movement orders. Secretary noted that at end of conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> he had asked whether there was agreement on course of action, so that he could confidently discuss along the same lines with French and <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. Prime Minister had said yes, but Secretary could not be sure there would not be some subsequent slippage.</p>
<p>Re <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit to Moscow, Secretary said Prime Minister had not discussed with him in any respect what he would do there other than, as already publicly stated, to attempt reconnaissance but not conduct of negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> probably had no plan which he was going to propose to Soviets. Secretary said he doubted whether British had thought position through but that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit would make British public opinion happy.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> raised point German preoccupation with inclusion of disarmament on agenda of possible conference with Soviets. He recalled that December 31 note<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">See <ref target="#d118">Document 118</ref>.</note> had said meeting should discuss German problems. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> doubted wisdom inclusion disarmament since if meeting not <pb xml:id="pg_327" n="327" facs="0352"/>limited specifically to German question Soviets would contend there was no reason why it should be four power meeting and would certainly demand parity. Moreover, discussion of disarmament might be embarrassing to West which not in full agreement re Geneva test suspension talks. Secretary noted that considerable portion of talks in London had been devoted to status of Geneva Conference on nuclear tests. He explained US position on veto along lines <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 9 from London.<note n="4" xml:id="d161fn4"><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 9, February 5, reported in detail on <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ conversation with the British on nuclear test negotiations. (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1203)</note></p>
<p>Secretary referred to message he had had from <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, describing it in same general terms as to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> (reported <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 4). Secretary added that if certain problems re Germany had to be discussed in context of disarmament, conference on surprise attack could be reconvened to provide that context.<note n="5" xml:id="d161fn5">Documentation on the surprise attack conference, November 10–December 18, 1958, is scheduled for publication in the compilation on disarmament in volume III.</note> He agreed that if a meeting of Foreign Ministers were to discuss disarmament, serious problems re composition would be raised.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed with Secretary’s analysis of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> position on disarmament. He said Chancellor’s belief that agreement on disarmament would lead to world detente within framework of which solution to all other problems could be found was not realistic. Secretary stated that, in his opinion, we could not make much headway in disarmament field until at least some political problems had been solved. As long as these remained unsolved, continuance of tensions would require maintenance of armaments.</p>
<p>Secretary referred to discussion London re possibility meeting of four Foreign Ministers in Paris March 15–19 to agree on substance of Western position for conference with Soviets. Secretary noted dates in question acceptable to US. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said such meeting could be envisaged, but frankly question of whether three or four Foreign Ministers should meet created difficulty for French. He believed it was good to stick to idea that basic responsibility for Berlin was that of three powers. Secretary suggested that perhaps procedure could be followed as during December<note n="6" xml:id="d161fn6">See <ref target="#d105">Documents 105</ref>–<ref target="#d109">109</ref>.</note> meeting with tripartite meeting perhaps on March 15 followed by quadripartite meeting following day. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he believed this could be worked out.</p>
<p>In response to query by Secretary as to whether French had any thought on substance of Western position which they wished to divulge, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said French had no precise ideas as yet. Arriving at substantive position would be hardest task Western powers faced. Secretary commented that he supposed we should start with November 1955 proposals.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_328" n="328" facs="0353"/>
<p>These had been presented as rather complicated package,<note n="7" xml:id="d161fn7">For documentation, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, vol. V</ref>, pp. 537 ff.</note> in fact so complicated nobody had really ever understood them. However, there was much good in these proposals which now needed to be polished up and given a new look. Perhaps they could be supplemented in some respects. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that presumably both sides would start from previous positions, with Soviets insisting that reunification was matter solely for discussion between two German states and favoring some sort of disengagement. It was unlikely that either side would change much. Obviously, no agreement with Soviets would be attainable under these circumstances. If no such agreement on general solution were possible, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> continued, then Western powers must find some sort of modus vivendi. If reunification impossible to achieve at present time, then solution must be sought which would enable us to get through next few years.</p>
<p>Secretary said he did not think we were going to bring about reunification of Germany at conference. He was not sure, despite considerable talk on subject, that there was much real eagerness for reunification. Even in Germany there were factors such as possibility of an increased socialist strength which reduced enthusiasm. Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> ended with agreement on note that <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> should be less fearful of arrangements which would permit exercise of its influence over East Germany, and that there was no need for inferiority complex vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 17. Secretary’s talk with President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, at which President was accompanied by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName>, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> and de Courcel, opened with suggestion by Secretary that <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> might wish to inform <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> of matters discussed at meeting terminated one-half hour previously at Foreign Office.<note n="1" xml:id="d162fn1">See <ref target="#d161">Document 161</ref>.</note></p>
<p>Foreign Ministers outlined agreements reached on contingency planning, possible conference with Soviets and preparatory meetings which would have to be held before conference, and possible agenda for meeting with Soviets.</p>
<p>With reference to Berlin contingency planning, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> indicated he was entirely in agreement that we could not permit Soviets to turn over to vanquished (<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Germans) rights which we had obtained as victors in Germany and that we should meet any attempt to interfere with our communications with Berlin with force.</p>
<p>Secretary went into more detail in this connection indicating that if Allied convoy was stopped by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> it should be prepared to identify itself but go no farther in complying with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> request. If <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> then attempted impede our access with roadblocks, blown bridges, or by other forceful means, we should take matter to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
<p>At this point both <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and Prime Minister seriously questioned advisability of taking matter to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> before a) either resorting to force ourselves or b) mounting small air lift.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> made strong point that we should immediately go into air operation since it would be psychologically easier to do this at early juncture than later.</p>
<p>Secretary explained his fear that such a step might whittle away our determination to force our way on land, since public opinion might reach conclusion that as we were carrying along satisfactorily by air lift there would be no need to resort to force.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said matter is as simple as this: once Allied convoy in question had established identification to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> it should brook no <pb xml:id="pg_330" n="330" facs="0355"/>hindrance. He asked whether we would be prepared to permit <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to stamp identification documents on pretext perhaps that this necessary for clearance through next security check point.</p>
<p>Secretary said we would not accept that. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> concurred, commenting that time stamp not necessary since notice could be telephoned to next checkpoint.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> indicated that we must be clear on these little details for they could lead to considerable trouble later.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> did not appear to take to idea of having to wait while matter was taken through Security Council and possibly General Assembly, believing that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would probably appoint commission, send <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> to investigate on spot, authorize <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> to assume responsibility for supplying and administering Berlin. Thus we would be faced with question of Allied rights in Berlin being substituted by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
<p>Secretary explained that we could take temperature of how matter likely be received in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and if it appeared it would go as President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> feared then Secretary would not be prepared to take matter to <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>
<p>Secretary also explained that one reason for not forcing issue of passage immediately was that our military need to make certain preparations for such an operation. They would like to begin making preparations even now, but on political level we do not consider this advisable, therefore a certain time will be required from moment when we have ascertained that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> prepared to employ force to hinder our passage until we are ready ourselves to use effective counter-force.</p>
<p>Secretary also indicated that such delay would enable us to build up public opinion and demonstrate clearly to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and world at large, etc. that our rights were being interfered with and we were merely taking only justifiable measures.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> pointed out his view that it would be difficult to obtain 2/3 majority in Assembly approving Allies maintaining position in Berlin by force. He emphasized danger of position of our communication with our garrisons in Berlin becoming frozen unless some sort of air supply were quickly established.</p>
<p>Secretary pointed out that situation quite different from 1948 since our Berlin garrisons now have adequate supplies for six months and blockade would presumably apply only to our garrisons and not as in 1948 to Berlin as whole.</p>
<p>Secretary emphasized his belief that we might succeed in obtaining very strong vote our favor in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, such as we did with respect to Hungary.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_331" n="331" facs="0356"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> countered this by saying situation quite different from Hungary for now Soviets have maneuvered themselves into position of appearing to be offering something to East Germans.</p>
<p>Secretary said he was quite prepared thoroughly to review policy of taking matter to Assembly if it appeared there would be an adverse vote, as he did not believe that our clearly established rights should be permitted to be dependent on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> approval.</p>
<p>Secretary added that at beginning of his talk with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">See <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note> British had seemed inclined to willingness provide <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials more than identification of vehicles and were perhaps slightly soft about getting into a position which could be interpreted as de facto recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> insisted that we should obtain very clear agreement on this primary principle with British.</p>
<p>Secretary felt that by end of his discussions with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, British were prepared to accept Secretary’s contentions and had so indicated. Secretary did not feel however that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was so solid that there might not be some slippage in future.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister pointed out that customary air traffic would be in operation even though there was not an airlift.</p>
<p>Subject of possible conference with Soviets next discussed and agreement reached that in our notes to Moscow we would not propose date prior to May 27, but that if Soviets suggested meeting before that date we were quite prepared to go along.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister said he feared that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, who anxious for early meeting, would discuss matter of dates on his forthcoming trip to Moscow.</p>
<p>Agenda for possible conference discussed next and Secretary indicated that prior to his departure from Washington he had received a letter from <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d162fn3"><ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note> suggesting that subject disarmament should be included.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister indicated that <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">Fr?</hi>] opposed to this for reasons outlined in earlier conversation, to wit Soviets would probably drag China in and also Western Allies did not have agreed position on disarmament.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said one must admit that introduction of disarmament would cause trouble, but at same time if we hoped to accomplish anything with conference it would be necessary to touch on this subject. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De <pb xml:id="pg_332" n="332" facs="0357"/>Gaulle</persName> then inquired whether Secretary had any suggestions as to how something constructive might be accomplished in meeting with Soviets.</p>
<p>Secretary explained that he was not opposed to disarmament entirely for reasons outlined here by Foreign Minister, but more because as Foreign Minister had explained in earlier conversation it would remove conference from jurisdiction of four nations having responsibility for Germany. He added however that he did not exclude possibility that in such a conference we would have to give consideration to various suggestions such as thinning out of forces, Rapacki Plan,<note n="4" xml:id="d162fn4">See <ref target="#d43fn2">footnote 2, Document 43</ref>.</note> disarmament in Eastern Europe, etc., all of which was quite different from general disarmament.</p>
<p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> interjected that we should bear in mind that Soviets’ primary objective was to get Allies out of Berlin.</p>
<p>Secretary agreed, emphasizing that people of Berlin would feel lost if we removed our troops and he questioned in any event value of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> guarantees.</p>
<p>In answer to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s inquiry as to how far Secretary thought Soviets were prepared to go, Secretary indicated that he thought Soviets were not genuinely desirous of solving Berlin and German question. They created difficulty in Berlin, they merely wished to try to force us to recognize <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and to stir up trouble for their own advantage.</p>
<p>Secretary indicated however he felt that we should have to hold a conference to show to the world that we were reasonable people and prepared to discuss these problems, but he did not feel that we would at this juncture settle the German problem. Secretary continued that he thought point of departure could for such a meeting be revision of our proposals at the Geneva Conference of 1955 which were in themselves good proposals, but were too complicated to be understood by public, had been twisted by Molotov, etc. However, they had much merit and would have to be put in simpler form in which their merits would be more apparent to public.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> was particularly anxious to know whether Secretary had any formula which went beyond merely satisfying public and contained possibility of approaching solution to German problem.</p>
<p>Secretary explained that he had not at this juncture and that while most people paid lip service to unification, he was not certain how many really wanted it, including Federal Republic itself. Secretary indicated that when he had met President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in 1947<note n="5" xml:id="d162fn5">For a report on <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> on December 6, 1947, see <ref target="frus1947v02"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1947, vol. II</ref>, pp. 793–794.</note> President had not been strong advocate for German reunification.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_333" n="333" facs="0358"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that this was the case in 1947 and it was so today, first because of the situation in France, and second because of the fear which would be created among all people, not governments, people of Eastern Europe, Poles, Czechs, etc., at unified Germany.</p>
<p>Secretary indicated that he did think Federal Republic, which was more vigorous and had greater attraction for German people as flow of refugees from East indicated, could establish contacts with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and take other steps which would generally render <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> more healthy place, but that Federal Republic had for one reason or another acted rather stuffily in this matter.</p>
<p>President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> concurred and thought that it might be possible to push forward in matters of transport, post, telegraph, railroads, canals, etc. which would bring about slight changes and closer rapprochement between East and West Germany. He next inquired what the Secretary’s views were on the Oder–Neisse frontier.</p>
<p>Secretary indicated that in <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> letter referred to above, Chancellor had indicated that he was prepared to make statement on that subject, though he did not know precisely what the Chancellor had in mind.</p>
<p>When Foreign Minister raised question of March preparatory meeting of Foreign Ministers taking place to prepare for conference, President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> indicated he would welcome such meeting here and counseled that it should not be a hurried meeting; plenty of time should be allowed for deliberation and even if it were necessary to interrupt it, it should be renewed and the subjects should be studied in calmness and without pressure.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> proposed that prior meeting be held between US, UK and France and that Germans should be invited following that to consult. This would in his opinion make our position stronger as the nations responsible for Germany in the public mind.</p>
<p>Secretary indicated he accepted this procedure, particularly on matters dealing with Berlin inasmuch as we had reserved our rights on Berlin matters when we had transferred to Federal Republic other attributes of sovereignty.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 8. Eyes only Acting Secretary for President from Secretary.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>We had a surprisingly good day here with the French. We first met with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> at the Quai d’Orsay.<note n="1" xml:id="d163fn1">See <ref target="#d161">Document 161</ref>.</note> I outlined our general thinking about handling the Berlin situation and my views seemed to coincide largely with those of the French. Then we went to the Elysee and met with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">See <ref target="#d162">Document 162</ref>.</note> With only <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName>, we were four on the side and sat around informally in chairs in the living-room instead of sitting across a table. The atmosphere was relaxed and the General seemed to be in good spirits. We developed again our German thesis and found acceptance. The French, unlike the U.K., seemed quite specific that we could not accept a substitution of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for the Soviet Union in the exercise of our reserved rights in Berlin as victors in the war. I emphasized that we could not permit roles to be reversed and the vanquished in effect rule the victors. This appealed to the General and was strongly reinforced by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>. The French would, I think, be willing immediately on May 27th or as soon as Soviet turnover is an accomplished fact to attempt use force to go through. I doubt whether they have thought this out and realize all the implications. In any event they accepted my view that though we should at that time begin military preparations we should not actually move until we had made a final effort to mobilize world opinion against the Soviets on the basis of not mere threats but such actual deeds as blowing up bridges, creating roadblocks and the like. There was a slight difference of opinion as to the desirability at this juncture of going to the United Nations. The French are pretty gun shy about the United Nations. I said of course we would not advocate going unless we felt confident that we could get a solid vote to support our position. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is fearful that the General Assembly would be in a mood to compromise and might, for example, call on <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> to negotiate a settlement. I think there is no doubt but what there is ground for apprehension on this score and we would have to make a careful count of votes before going to the General Assembly.</p>

<pb xml:id="pg_335" n="335" facs="0360"/>
<p>This afternoon I had a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">A memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>, <gloss target="#t_SVEMC1">SVE/MC</gloss>–13, is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1198.</note> I brought him pretty well up to date as to our thinking. He himself has been doing quite a lot of thinking, particularly about the German problem as a whole. He has not come up with anything very new or brilliant but I urged him to continue studying the matter as we needed his kind of mind applied to this problem and he had some advantages over governments.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had been thinking in terms of our accepting a substitution of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for the Soviet Union and only react if thereafter they imposed more severe restrictions. However, when I explained to him the theory of our position, he said that he had not thought of this and was inclined to agree.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning I go on to Bonn. There seems to be agreement both in London and in Paris that the Chancellor is pretty much out of touch with his advisers and with current developments, and both the British and the French and <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> are hopeful that I may be able to bring him to see possibilities in the situation to which he is now blind. However, these possibilities are not so brilliant that I feel confident that they have much penetrating power. As <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said, a great deal is to be said in favor of the status quo. Almost any change would be a change for the worse and would open up serious problems. I do not think, however, nor does he, that that is a position which we can take publicly and command the support of public opinion.</p>

<p>The Chief of Protocol, von Braun, came to fetch us, and we arrived at the Palais Schaumburg at four o’clock. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Livie</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d164fn1"><persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Livingston Merchant</persName>.</note> and myself went into the Chancellor’s office for a private meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> and himself, <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Weber</persName> acting as interpreter. The Chancellor started immediately on the proposed <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> trip to Moscow, saying it had, of course, to be accepted as a fait accompli, but he had serious apprehensions as to its consequences. He referred to notes covering a conversation with Kit <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> at the time the latter delivered <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s letter on the subject. <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> had, in effect, remarked on the ultimate necessity of negotiations between the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Federal Republic and recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Since <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> considered <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> a thoroughly trained and loyal diplomat, he could not but think he was faithfully expressing views held by his Foreign Office. The Chancellor thought he would write to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and ask for an explanation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> told him that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and himself both were skeptical over the potential usefulness of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s visit to the Soviet Union, and fearful of even his most carefully guarded comments being misconstrued. However, there was nothing to be done about it, and one must hope for the best. The Chancellor thought the primary motive of the trip was to gather prestige for domestic election application in England.</p>

<p>The Chancellor thanked the Secretary for coming to see him and said now that the Secretary had been to London and Paris he would like to get his overall impression of the situation.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that in London and Paris the discussions followed two principal lines—the technical problems to meet the Soviet threat to Berlin, and the possibility of having discussions with the Soviet Union on the broader German problem, including reunification and European Security.</p>
<p>In his talks in London and Paris, the Secretary said he had expressed the view that we could not accept the substitution of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for the Soviet Union in clearing our military traffic to and from Berlin. The French accepted this view. The British did so haltingly. M. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> apparently had not been thinking along these lines, but after his talk with the Secretary seemed convinced of the correctness of this view. The Secretary had pointed out that as far as the East Germans were concerned our relationship to them in Berlin was as victors who had won certain rights and it would be intolerable to permit defeated East Germans, with whom we have no treaty relations and do not recognize, to exercise control over our troops who are in Berlin by virtue of rights we won in the war.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_338" n="338" facs="0363"/>
<p>The Secretary said it was his view that while we might be prepared to identify our traffic to the East Germans, we would not permit them to stamp our documents or exercise the right of inspection over our traffic. However, if any effort were made to prevent our passage either by destroying bridges, erecting road blocks or using force, that would create a grave situation which would justify serious military preparations. In such an event, we might take the matter to the United Nations, but only if we were certain of overwhelming support for our position in the United Nations, and provided that such an approach would not bog down the measures we intended to take.</p>
<p>Insofar as a meeting with the Soviet Union was concerned, the Secretary said he found differences between the British and the French concerning the date for such a meeting. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was extremely anxious to have such a meeting in advance of May 27 to insure that we would be conferring on that date. The French, however, felt that if the West proposed that such a meeting take place prior to May 27, the Soviets would interpret this as a sign of weakness and assume we were prepared to make concessions to forestall the threatened Soviet measures.</p>
<p>The Secretary said the British and French accepted his compromise proposal that such a meeting take place at a time and place mutually acceptable to the Four Powers. This would force the Soviet Union to share with us the responsibility for setting the date for the meeting and obviate the danger envisaged by the French.</p>
<p>Turning to the question of the substantive matters to be discussed at a meeting with the Soviet Union, the Secretary said it was generally assumed that the subject for such a meeting would be Germany. However, there probably would not be a specific agenda so that all sides would be free to introduce any aspect of the problem. With reference to specific proposals which the West might make, the Secretary said he found general agreement in London and Paris that these should be based on those which we tabled at the November 1955 Conference. These proposals were sound then; they are sound now. The difficulty then was that they were too complicated and never adequately presented. They now needed a new setting, perhaps with a greater emphasis on the aspects of a German peace treaty, and less exclusive concern with the problem of reunification.</p>
<p>The Secretary went on to say there sometimes is a tendency on the part of the Western Powers to minimize or not adequately appraise the achievements obtained in West Germany since the end of the war, particularly under the leadership of Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. Actually these achievements have been tremendous. For the first time in history, Germany has genuinely friendly relations with France. Great progress has been made in European military, economic and even to some degree, <pb xml:id="pg_339" n="339" facs="0364"/>political integration, i.e., <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>, Coal and <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> Community, <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss>, Common Market. These represent immense gains and are precisely what the Soviet Union wants destroyed. It is therefore important not to give the Soviet Union or public opinion the impression that we are prepared to buy reunification at a price requiring the sacrifice of these gains, which would result in leaving Germany alone in Central Europe in a position to play the East against the West. The Secretary added he thought we could and should show at a conference that these gains can be preserved with a reunified Germany without endangering the Soviet Union. In fact, as the United States sees it, this would be one of the principal purposes of our meeting with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he himself did not expect the Soviet Union to agree to any measures which did not involve as a probable and necessary consequence the collapse of the structure of European integration. But the task of the Western Powers, he said, was to make clear to the world that the Soviet Union was responsible for the failure to reach agreement and that the Western Powers are prepared to pursue a sound and constructive course that carries no threat to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Secretary expressed the hope that the Federal Republic would contribute to that presentation along the lines suggested in the Chancellor’s recent message to the Secretary<note n="1" xml:id="d165fn1"><ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note> (i.e., establishment of German relations with Poland and Czechoslovakia and a statement on the Oder-Neisse problem) and by expanding de facto relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to make the attractive influence of the Federal Republic felt in the Soviet Zone.</p>
<p>The Secretary stressed that although these ideas had been generally accepted by the British, the French and M. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>, they were still tentative. He therefore thought it might be useful to hold a Western Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Paris, possibly in mid-March, to develop the Western position more concretely. To emphasize Four Power responsibility with the Soviet Union on the solution of the German question, he thought it might be desirable for the Three Foreign Ministers to meet once as such and have this followed by a Four Power Foreign Ministers’ meeting, with the Federal Republic participating fully. To prepare for these meetings, the Secretary said he supposed a Four Power Working Group of technical experts would prepare a report for the Ministers to examine.</p>
<p>The Secretary cautioned that there was no reason to expect that the Soviet Union would accept a meeting at the Foreign Ministers’ level for the purpose and at the time we are suggesting. There were some indications that the Soviet Union would rather have a meeting at the Heads of Government level. That position may in part reflect the fact that Mr. <pb xml:id="pg_340" n="340" facs="0365"/><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> does not have the same authority or discretion as Western Foreign Ministers. But this, he remarked, was only speculative. The Secretary said he expected Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> would probably make soundings on this question while in Moscow, although the Secretary emphasized that the United States had not authorized or encouraged Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to do so.</p>
<p>The Chancellor expressed his gratitude for the Secretary’s frank comments and said he had some observations of his own to make. Recently, he said, the German Ambassador in Moscow had two talks with Soviet Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> which in themselves were not important. However, they did indicate that thus far there had been no softening in the Soviet position. (He said he would give Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> copies of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kroll</persName>’s reports for the Secretary’s use.)<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">Copies of the telegrams that summarized meetings on February 2 and 4 were transmitted as enclosures to despatch 1242 from Bonn, February 13. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/2–1359) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> transmitted a summary of the February 2 conversation that <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kroll</persName> had given him in telegram 1534 from Moscow, February 3. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/2–359)</note></p>
<p>The Chancellor then replied to the Secretary’s earlier remark that in formulating the Western position it seemed desirable to follow the basic lines of November 1955 with some emphasis on the peace treaty question. If this were done, the Chancellor observed, the question would inevitably be raised with whom such a treaty would be concluded.</p>
<p>The Chancellor said he fully agreed with the Secretary that reunification should not be bought at the price of freedom and the national and international gains of the last decade. Moreover, he was certain this was the feeling of the overwhelming majority of the German people, including the majority of those who voted for the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> in 1957.</p>
<p>The Chancellor then made several remarks about the views of George Kennan.<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">See <ref target="#d82fn1">footnote 1, Document 82</ref>.</note> He said he was astounded by the unrealistic proposals which Kennan was putting forth and surprised at the amount of public attention they seemed to command. (The Secretary remarked that they seemed to command greater attention in Germany than in the United States.)</p>
<p>The Chancellor then turned to the Secretary’s suggestion concerning the possibility of expanding West Germany’s de facto relations with the Soviet Zone. On this score, the Chancellor insisted, the Federal Republic had done as much as it could, but there was always the question of the barriers raised by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Federal Government, for example, had always given the Evangelical and Catholic Churches in the Soviet Zone its fullest support since they represented the strongest bulwarks against Communism. But now the Churches’ position in the <pb xml:id="pg_341" n="341" facs="0366"/>Zone had become so precarious it was no longer certain how much they could do. The Federal Government also tried to further personal contacts between the peoples of both parts of Germany, but the East Zone passport and travel regulations were making it impossible even for families to get together.</p>
<p>At this point, the Chancellor turned to the subject of security. He said that in the draft reply to the Soviet note of January 10 worked out by the Working Group in Washington,<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">See <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note> he noted references to “peace in Europe” and “peace in the world”. The two concepts, he said, were inseparable, for there could be no peace in Europe without peace in the world. Unfortunately, however, the myriad regional security plans of the Rapacki type, which were being tossed about in many quarters, created considerable confusion and sight was lost of the more important considerations. The fact of the matter is, the Chancellor said, there can be no peace until there is nuclear disarmament. Therefore, it was essential for the West to make it clear that until disarmament was a distinct possibility, it would do nothing to weaken Germany’s ties with the West or upset <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and European integration.</p>
<p>The Chancellor then said he wanted to speak about the Soviet aims and objectives as he saw them. The Soviets, he said, still adhere to their old thesis that Capitalism is doomed and Communism, under Soviet leadership, will dominate the world. The only real obstacle to the Soviet Union’s achieving this goal is the United States. Therefore, one had to expect that the Soviets would try to isolate and destroy the United States. The Chancellor brushed aside <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s claims of Soviet economic achievements as “grossly exaggerated”. However, he added, it was his opinion that one of the principal reasons the Soviet Union wanted to undermine European integration and get control of Germany’s economic potential was to strengthen its position in its economic war against the United States.</p>
<p>The Chancellor dismissed talk about Soviet fears of Germany and German rearmament as sheer nonsense. He said both <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> told him personally that there were only two real powers in the world today—the Soviet Union and the United States. But as long as the United States was as strong as the Soviet Union in the nuclear field, the Chancellor said he felt there probably would not be an all-out war. However, on the other hand, any indication of a breakdown in Western unity would be certain to encourage the Soviets to follow a more provocative policy. The Chancellor therefore hoped that in the future the Western Powers would do everything possible to present an unshakable united front.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_342" n="342" facs="0367"/>
<p>At this point the Chancellor said Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> had some remarks to make, which he did along the following lines: He said he was in complete agreement with the Secretary on the nature of the tasks ahead. There was no harm in repeating sound proposals. They merely had to be pulled together, polished and presented in a more comprehensible form for the man in the street. The alleged Soviet initiatives were merely a repetition of unacceptable proposals. The Foreign Minister went on to say that he hoped the Western Powers would include their London disarmament proposal in the package they finally present.<note n="5" xml:id="d165fn5">Not further identified</note></p>
<p>At this point the Chancellor interjected that he hoped the disarmament negotiations could be resumed soon but preferably “without the cooperation of Mr. Stassen”.<note n="6" xml:id="d165fn6">Harold Stassen was President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s special assistant for disarmament until February 1958.</note> <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> then continued. He said as far as the German Government was concerned, there were certain limits in negotiations beyond which it could not be expected to go. He said the Federal Government, for example, could not accept proposals requiring it to give up its ties with the West. Nor could it be expected to accept the Soviet Union’s peace treaty proposals which would give the Soviet Union the right of intervention.</p>
<p>With regard to Berlin, the Foreign Minister wanted to make these observations: the Berlin problem cannot be solved in isolation. It had to be dealt with in a broader context. However, if a conference were arranged to discuss the broader German problem, an interim solution might possibly be found; but any solution to be acceptable would have to protect the basic rights of Berlin. It was admittedly too early to try to envisage how negotiations might develop. But, as the Secretary indicated, it was important to make clear to the Soviet Union that any attempt by it to tamper with Berlin on a unilateral basis would be met by the resistance of the free world.</p>
<p>Returning to the Chancellor’s earlier question—with whom a German peace treaty would be signed—the Secretary said it would have to be a reunified Germany.</p>
<p>As far as Soviet policy was concerned, the Secretary remarked that the Chancellor’s thesis was generally accepted in the United States. The Secretary said we recognize that the Soviet Union considers the United States its primary enemy and ultimate target. Its purpose is to encircle the United States, picking up one country after another, adding to its economic strength and military capability so that it would ultimately be in a position to strangle us. Therefore, West Germany with its great industrial <pb xml:id="pg_343" n="343" facs="0368"/>potential is the great prize in Europe just as Japan is its target in Asia. It is because the United States realized this that it abandoned its traditional policy and made collective security arrangements with almost fifty countries.</p>
<p>Referring to the Chancellor’s recent letter to him, the Secretary said the Chancellor had indicated that he was afraid some people in the United States and the United Kingdom felt that if reunification could be accomplished on Soviet terms, then the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union could be resolved. This, the Secretary said emphatically, was not the thinking of responsible people in the United States. Recalling his recent testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,<note n="7" xml:id="d165fn7">For text of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ statement before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, February 16, 1959, pp. 219–222.</note> the Secretary said the Soviets talk about ending the cold war but they make no concrete proposals. The only proposals they make are calculated to help them win the cold war. And the majority of American public agrees with this view.</p>
<p>The problem, the Secretary said, is not one of reaching agreement with the Soviet Union. That is difficult at this time. Our main problem is to keep the support of free world opinion, by indicating our willingness to do what is decent and fair and demonstrating that the reason the cold war continues is that the Soviets will not make or keep agreements unless these help them win the cold war. The nuclear test talks now going on in Geneva<note n="8" xml:id="d165fn8">Documentation on the three-power conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapons’ tests, which reassembled at Geneva on January 5, is scheduled for publication in volume III.</note> have demonstrated this. The Soviet Union has continually talked about wanting to help humanity by ending nuclear tests and has tried to create the impression that it is willing to accept the principle of controls. But when confronted with concrete proposals, this turned out to be nothing but sham.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he felt the handling of the Geneva meeting on nuclear testing had been sound. The outcome could have been foreseen. However, the Secretary added, it would have been unfortunate from a public opinion point of view to have refused to meet with the Soviet Union. Moreover, by negotiating with them, they have amply demonstrated their bad faith.</p>
<p>There was no question, the Secretary said, but that the West had a strong case to make. The principal job, however, was to marshal the case effectively.</p>
<p>The Chancellor agreed, and remarked that it was too bad <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had not proved to be a more effective instrument for this purpose. The Secretary then commented the truth was that many governments did <pb xml:id="pg_344" n="344" facs="0369"/>not want to say unkind things about the Soviet Union. That, however, was a weakness of which he, the Secretary, could not be accused—and the Chancellor added nor could he.</p>
<p>The meeting concluded on this note, and it was agreed that the Chancellor and the Secretary would meet again the following morning.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 9. Eyes only Acting Secretary for President from Secretary.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>We left Paris this morning. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> was at the airport to see me off and we had a brief private talk.<note n="1" xml:id="d166fn1">A two-paragraph memorandum of this conversation, <gloss target="#t_SVEMC1">SVE/MC</gloss>–14, is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1201.</note> He indicated that the only significant point of difference between us seemed to be in the fact that the French believed that if there was any interference with our access to Berlin, we should instantly move with military force rather than go through the preparatory stage which we envisage. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he recalled 1936 and the failure then to react promptly when Hitler moved into the demilitarized area of Germany. He said then the military people had felt that they could not act without prior mobilization and like measures, but <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said they had been wrong. So now the French are disposed to act at once but without any preliminary steps such as total or partial mobilization, evacuation of dependents, etc.</p>
<p>Perhaps their zeal is due to the fact that it is we rather than they who would have to make most of the military effort as, I understand, they have very little military potential left in Germany.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Wahn airport about noon and the Chancellor, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> and others were there to meet me. The Chancellor and I drove back together to Bonn, and since it is a drive of about an hour, we had a good chance to have an initial really private talk, which is what the Chancellor likes. Then this afternoon we met at the Palais Schaumburg with the Chancellor and several members of the government, first having a semi-private talk with the Chancellor and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> on the one <pb xml:id="pg_345" n="345" facs="0370"/>side and <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David Bruce</persName> and me on the other.<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">See <ref target="#d164">Document 164</ref>.</note> The burden of this was the Chancellor’s concern about the British in general, about <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s trip to Moscow in particular and a recent statement made here by the British Ambassador that it would be inevitable to recognize the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>Then we went into a larger meeting and I reported quite fully on my talks at London and at Paris with the French government and with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">See <ref target="#d165">Document 165</ref>.</note> then the Chancellor and more briefly <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> expounded their views.</p>
<p>They seem to be satisfied with what I have told them about “contingency planning” in relation to Berlin. I did not however go into much detail. With respect to a conference on Germany, there seemed to be acquiescence, although chiefly discernible on the theory that “silence gives consent”. I hope to develop their attitude more definitively tomorrow when we meet again.</p>
<p>Faithfully yours,</p>

<p>Prior to meeting with the larger group as planned, the Chancellor indicated that he would like to have a short discussion with the Secretary in the presence of only a few advisers. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> will obtain from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Weber</persName> and forward to the Department the verbatim <pb xml:id="pg_346" n="346" facs="0371"/>record of the conversation which was kept by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WH1">Weber</persName> as interpreter. The following is dictated from my own notes to provide an earlier though less complete record.</p>
<p>The Chancellor opened by saying that he desired to discuss further and in greater detail the critical situation of Berlin. He agreed that it was wise to bury the Berlin crisis under a layer of broader problems in a conference with the Russians. If the conference failed, however, then the Berlin crisis was likely to become more acute. In consequence he thought there might be need for an interim or provisional solution of the problem of Berlin. If force were used the crisis would indeed become acute. Hence his thought of the provisional solution. He said that he had no answer to the problem himself but could describe in negative terms the boundaries which any such solution should not transgress. First, he said he attached the utmost importance to the maintenance of Western unity. (Later questions of the Secretary indicated that he was thinking of the French, British and US [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. The Secretary agreed on the importance of maintaining unity and said that he believed that we had it but that it was equally important that the Federal Republic should act in full agreement with the three Western powers since it was obviously most intimately involved.) Secondly, the Chancellor said we should not advance to any position which would require later withdrawal because of the damage it would do to Western prestige. (Under a question from the Secretary he said that he meant retreat from any <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> position.) Thirdly, the Chancellor said the situation should not be permitted to develop to any use of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In response the Secretary said that it was essential that we employ the necessary counter force if we found ourselves opposed by force. This required that we must face up to the possibility of a general nuclear war in which he noted the United States would prove to be the main target. He said that it would be disastrous for us to be committed to a conventional war in Europe. Surely this would please the Soviets with their great superiority in manpower and conventional weapons.</p>
<p>The Chancellor said that possibly he had been misunderstood. His nuclear point was addressed to the avoidance of using nonconventional weapons against the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> alone.</p>
<p>The Secretary then reviewed in detail the program for dealing with a substitution of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for the Soviets on May 27 or earlier. When he came to the later stages after physical obstructions had been encountered and we had concurrently launched a political, propaganda offensive against the Soviets and serious military preparations such as partial mobilization, he said we should, if this political offensive brought no change in the Soviet–<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> attitude and obstruction of our forces, send in an armored division to open up the land route. If this division encountered resistance then obviously a general war had started in which we <pb xml:id="pg_347" n="347" facs="0372"/>obviously would not forego the use of nuclear weapons. The Secretary concluded by saying that he was absolutely convinced that if we in the West were united and willing to take the risk of such general war then the Soviets will withdraw from their present position. We must, however, have the will (which he could assure the Chancellor the United States possessed) to use those elements of force in which we are superior. To fail to do so would be to invite defeat on a purely conventional battleground.</p>
<p>The Chancellor said that the unity of the British, French and United States was even more important than atomic bombs. (He did not elaborate his thought but I construed it as meaning that he considered such unity even more effective as a deterrent to the Soviets than our possession of nuclear weapons.) [<hi rend="italic">6 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p>The Secretary then said that the prime purpose of his present trip was further to cement Western unity and that he believed it existed. He emphasized that it was equally necessary that the Federal Republic be with us. He said that if the Federal Republic was not willing to pursue as strong a policy as we proposed, now was the time that we should be so informed.</p>
<p>The Chancellor said that his government was prepared to follow the program which the Secretary had outlined but that he feared a world war over Berlin would not have behind it public support in France, the UK, Germany or the United States.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that he could assure the Chancellor that the policy he had outlined would have public support in the United States and that he was equally sure that the Governments of France and Great Britain were in favor of a strong stand. In fact he said the only difference among the three powers was that the French were inclined to be more truculent.</p>
<p>The Chancellor reiterated that he supported the two-stage contingency plan proposed by the Secretary. He thought it was correct and that his government would support it.</p>
<p>The Secretary then asked what the Chancellor had in mind when he spoke of a provisional solution for Berlin.</p>
<p>The Chancellor said that the best provisional solution, which he was not sure we could get, would be an indefinite deferral of the May 27 date when the Soviets had promised they would turn over their rights to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He said that he was concerned over the very real possibility of growing nervousness and even an exodus from West Berlin as the date approached.</p>
<p>The Chancellor then raised (as he had at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Heads of Government Meeting in 1957) the question of extending the life of the North Atlantic Treaty beyond the 20-year period which ended in 1968.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_348" n="348" facs="0373"/>
<p>The Secretary reminded him that we had stated thereafter, responsive to his request, that we in the United States felt that the North Atlantic Treaty should be regarded as of indefinite duration.</p>
<p>The Chancellor thought this was not good enough.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that we would bear in mind this proposal and would not oppose an amendment to the Treaty extending it say for 20 years (as the Chancellor subsequently suggested) but that he felt strongly the present was not timely for any such action in light of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s dissatisfaction with the terms and breadth of the Treaty. He feared that any opening up of the Treaty for extension would invite French amendments which would be undesirable. With the passage of time, however, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> would no doubt become more familiar with and fonder of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
<p>The Chancellor then suggested that they join the larger group which was waiting in the conference room.</p>

<p>After a restricted meeting between the Secretary, the Chancellor and the Foreign Minister,<note n="1" xml:id="d168fn1">See <ref target="#d167">Document 167</ref>.</note> the larger meeting resumed.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said he would like to have the Secretary’s impressions on procedures, particularly the arrangements for the meetings ahead. As he understood the Secretary yesterday,<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">See <ref target="#d165">Document 165</ref>.</note> the Working Group of technical <pb xml:id="pg_349" n="349" facs="0374"/>experts would reassemble in Paris after the current Washington meeting<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">See <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note> to study the Western proposals made thus far and attempt to give them a new form and setting. This package would then be given to the Four Western Foreign Ministers for examination. In view of the scheduled <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Washington April 2–4, it occurred to him that it might be appropriate for the Three and then the Four Ministers to meet in Paris in the second half of March and in replying to the Soviet note of January 10<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">See <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>.</note> seek as early a date as possible for the meeting with the Soviet Union, preferably mid-April. The Federal Government, he said, was of the opinion that the lapsed time between the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Conference and the Conference with the Soviet Union should be held to a minimum to forestall unnecessary talk and public speculation based on inevitable leaks.</p>
<p>As far as the question of presentation was concerned, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> thought that the German contribution at the conference outlined in the Chancellor’s memorandum to the Secretary<note n="5" xml:id="d168fn5"><ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note> (i.e., the establishment of German diplomatic relations with Poland and Czechoslovakia and the declaration on the Oder-Neisse) as a matter of tactics should be introduced during the course of negotiations rather than at the initial stage of the conference.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he would ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> to answer the Foreign Minister’s questions on procedure, but first he, the Secretary, had some comments of his own to make. He said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> felt very strongly that the meeting with the Soviet Union should start as close to May 27 as possible, perhaps about May 10, so that a conference would still be in session at that time and not have collapsed before then. Envisaging a four to five week conference, such as that of November 1955, a meeting that began in April might have broken up by May 27, and thus deprive the Soviets of the pretext for postponing the threatened Berlin action.</p>
<p>On first reaction, the Secretary said he was inclined to agree with the Foreign Minister on the appropriate time for tabling the German proposals, particularly since the Federal Republic would not be a participant in a Four Power conference. The Secretary stressed, however, that all through the conference the United States would want to consult very intimately with the Germans on the initial program which the Western Powers would present, since our proposals might require indicating the desire of the Federal Government to establish certain types of interchanges with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_350" n="350" facs="0375"/>
<p>Referring to his remarks yesterday concerning the desirability for establishing freer communication and travel between the two parts of Germany, the Secretary said the West might want to suggest the establishment of common standards of human rights and fundamental freedoms in both parts of Germany. Proposals of this kind, he thought, would probably command a good deal of world support.</p>
<p>With reference to the question of procedure, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said it was tentatively planned that the Working Group of technical experts would start meeting in Paris possibly before the end of this month to examine the substance of our positions and the form of presentation. He thought the Working Group now meeting in Washington could have some preliminary exchanges on these matters. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said agreement now seems to have been reached in Washington on the texts of the Four Western replies to the Soviet note of January 10 and, allowing for adequate time for consultation with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, he thought they might be handed to the Soviets in a week or ten days.</p>
<p>On this basis, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> thought the Four Western Foreign Ministers might plan to meet in mid-March to consider the progress reports of the Working Group and give the necessary guidance and instruction for its further work. The next step, he said, might be for the Four Western Foreign Ministers to meet in Washington during the April <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers’ meeting to give further policy guidance and concert their presentation to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said that although he still felt an early conference with the Soviets was desirable, this was not a fundamental problem and could be discussed further.</p>
<p>The Chancellor interjected to say that we would perhaps have a better idea of a possible date for a meeting with the Soviets after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> returned from Moscow. Then the Chancellor asked rhetorically whether anyone knew the date of the coming British elections.</p>
<p>The Chancellor then changed the line of discussion and referred to certain ideas mentioned to him by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> concerning the desirability of having a protracted meeting with the Soviets. The Chancellor, of course, was aware that Foreign Ministers always had calendars at their elbows and therefore cannot talk indefinitely. However, he wondered whether a conference with the Soviets could not be continued by the Deputy Foreign Ministers guided by the Foreign Ministers. This would remove artificial time limits normally set for Foreign Ministers’ meetings and give all parties concerned an opportunity to know each other and even establish some measure of personal confidence. Moreover, the Russians like long conferences, long speeches and long discussions; it is in their nature.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_351" n="351" facs="0376"/>
<p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> intervened to say that it was his impression that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> probably had little else to do and therefore in this respect was probably expendable. This, however, did not apply to the Western Foreign Ministers. More seriously, the Secretary said he thought there was merit in having a continuing body study these problems. As a matter of fact experience has indicated that there seemed to be a useful purpose in merely having talks go on. He cited our talks with the Chinese Communists in Warsaw as a case in point. He said these talks in themselves were absolutely barren but the fact that our representatives were in touch with each other probably makes it more difficult for the Chinese Communists to launch attacks at this time. The Secretary thought it was particularly interesting that the Chinese Communists launched their attacks last August when our talks with them in Geneva were suspended following Ambassador Johnson’s transfer from Prague. This may have been coincidental, the Secretary said, but it does seem that talking provides some measure of insurance for peace.</p>
<p>Returning to the Secretary’s remarks on the establishment of common standards of rights and freedom in both parts of Germany, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said he thought this an extremely good idea and that perhaps the United Nations might be given an enforcing role.</p>
<p>Bringing the discussions to a close, the Chancellor said he had one more point to make—that was that the West should make it absolutely clear that it will not make a single concession without obtaining a counter-concession. Concessions made without equivalent counter-concessions only served to make the Soviets more greedy and more intransigent. The Chancellor said he would like to have this precept brought to the attention of the press and particularly to those parliamentarians who seem to insist only upon a Western demonstration of flexibility.</p>
<p>In concluding his remarks, the Chancellor expressed his sincere gratitude to the Secretary for making this visit, and hoped the Secretary would have time to calmly reflect on the things he heard and discussed during the course of this trip.</p>
<p>The Secretary in turn said that although he was never happy when there were international crises, he did find one compensation—it afforded him the opportunity to meet with the Chancellor and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr v. Brentano</persName>. He said there was a value that came out of comradeship of working together for peace and justice. He was always extremely satisfied when he met with the Chancellor and the Foreign Minister either in Bonn or elsewhere, and rejoiced in the common spirit and motives which bound the two countries. This series of meetings this weekend was still another example of this relationship at an important and perhaps crucial moment.</p>

<p>The Secretary greeted Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>, recalling his conversations with him in Paris and stating that for him to come at this time added a personal note which means a great deal in the consideration of Berlin problems.</p>
<p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> indicated that he was greatly heartened by the reception here and the strong reaction and support he had found to the importance of standing by Berlin.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he believed his own trip had been useful and even essential. While there are still specific details to be worked out, there was at this time agreement between the four powers which provides a firm basis for the development of detailed plans of action in the working group of experts. He felt an understanding as to what we would and would not do, between the United Kingdom, France, the Federal Republic and the United States was highly gratifying. He had also had a good conversation with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d169fn2">See <ref target="#d163fn3">footnote 3, Document 163</ref>.</note></p>
<p>It is now recognized that we mean business, he added, and although the Soviets will keep the pressure on, there is a likelihood that they will withdraw at the last minute.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> stated that he thought the situation very dangerous in the first few weeks for two reasons. First, the Soviets thought they could <pb xml:id="pg_353" n="353" facs="0378"/>push the Western Allies out without great difficulty. Second, they expected to upset the economic stability of Berlin.</p>
<p>He said there had been no significant flight of capital. The initial outflow loss of bank deposits had been reversed.</p>
<p>He asked if a date had been set for a conference before May 27.</p>
<p>The Secretary answered that the French had objected to such a date on the grounds that it would indicate weakness. However, he had proposed a compromise that a conference be held at a time and place mutually agreeable. Thus the Soviets would share the responsibility for the date. He added that, of course, we do not know if the Soviets want a conference at the Foreign Ministers level or on Germany. They may insist on a meeting “at the Summit”. If they wish a conference on European security, the matter becomes very complicated with countries other than the four involved, and the Soviets perhaps raising the question of parity.</p>
<p>Further, with regard to access, the Secretary emphasized that there would be no acceptance of substitution for the Soviets at the check points. Some of the planning involves decision on minute details. However, it was agreed there would be no inspection of vehicles and no stamping of documents, only the showing of evidence of identification of the persons and vehicles to officials of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>The Mayor remarked that this course of action might only postpone the difficulties since before too long they would start something.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that the only question raised so far was the right of Allied troops to remain in Berlin. He queried <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> as to what he meant—the blowing up of a bridge, road blocks or other physical obstruction—</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said that the position outlined by the Secretary was a good one.</p>
<p>The Secretary, referring to his previous comment as to “no acceptance of substitutions,” etc., asked “Is that what you want?” <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> agreed.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> referred then to the Paris (1949) agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d169fn3">For text of the final communiqué of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers Meeting, June 20, 1949, see <ref target="frus1949v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 1062–1065.</note> He said that these dealt with land and not air access. Now the East German papers have said the commercial air traffic is a misuse of the agreements. He suggested that there might be “an enlargement of interference”.</p>
<p>The Secretary agreed the Paris statements covered the “normal civilian access.” He thought there would be no immediate trouble if and when the Soviets withdraw, but that “our situation changes.” Now, the German <hi rend="italic">civilians</hi> deal with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Soviets only control the <hi rend="italic">military.</hi></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_354" n="354" facs="0379"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> countered that the Soviets were always there as supervisors of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials.</p>
<p>The Secretary warned that it would be a mistake to anticipate interference with civilian traffic since this might serve to stimulate the Soviets to such action. Now they want the occupying forces to get out.</p>
<p>In any case, the Mayor said, there is no real substitute for US troops. He did not think Egyptians or Mexicans could take their place.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said the United Nations was not like a government. It can act only for and through its members. There have been difficulties on this score in the Far East where the participants did not wish to bear the continuing burden of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mission.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> recalled the failure of the guarantee of Danzig under circumstances more favorable than the proposals for Berlin.</p>
<p>The Secretary in concluding the interview said Soviet guarantees had never proved reliable but merely the first step to absorption. He recalled the guarantee to Poland and the way it was taken over with “one swift blow”.</p>
<p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> expressed his appreciation for all the Secretary had done.</p>

<p>1. The Secretary discussed privately with the President his letter of February 9<note n="1" xml:id="d170fn1">Not printed; for text of this letter, in which <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked for a few weeks’ leave to recuperate and concentrate on the Berlin question, see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, February 10, 1959, pp. 1 and 3.</note> (copy attached), and some aspects of his talks during the preceding week in Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJNJ1">Greene</persName> joined the President and the Secretary and there was considerable discussion whether to release the Secretary’s letter to the President at the latter’s press conference the next morning. After discussion of the pros and cons of this course and of releasing the letter right away, the President and <pb xml:id="pg_355" n="355" facs="0380"/>the Secretary decided to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> release it right away. On hearing that Mr. Macomber had requested delay in the release time to permit advance notification to key members of the Congress, the President expressed his willingness to have a brief delay and instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> to hold up the release until 6:15 p.m. The President said he would open his press conference the next morning with a statement that he accepted and approved the Secretary’s proposals in the letter.<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">For a transcript of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s press conference on February 10, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>, 1959</hi>, pp. 168–178.</note></p>
<p>2. The Secretary reported fully on his talk Sunday morning with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> relating the Chancellor’s concern about the nuclear deterrent, and left with the President a copy of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJH1">Whitney</persName>’s telegram # 4115,<note n="3" xml:id="d170fn3">Telegram 4115, February 9, reported that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was very enthusiastic about <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ visit and that it had been most helpful. (Department of State, Central Files, 110.11–DU/2–959)</note> reporting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s comments to the Ambassador on the Secretary’s trip.</p>
<p>Reverting to his talks with the Chancellor, the Secretary told the President that the Chancellor seemed agreeable to our putting forward new proposals in any meeting with the Soviets, so long as we did these one by one rather than all at once, so as to have an opportunity to judge at each step the Soviet reaction. The Secretary said the Chancellor does not want to be committed by proposals to the Soviets unless there is some indication at each step along the way that some counterpart commitment will be received.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that it is not certain that the Soviets will agree to meet with the West at the Foreign Minister level. He noted that there are indications that the Soviets want a meeting at the Heads of Government level; our own view of this possibility should take into account that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is not really in a position to negotiate for the Soviet Government. The Secretary speculated that events might develop so that a Heads of Government meeting could be envisaged. He and the President agreed that, insofar as the President was concerned, he might fly to Europe for the first two or three days of such a meeting, then turn over to the Secretary, with the possibility that, if the negotiations really got somewhere, the President could later return for the conclusion.</p>
<p>Adverting to his letter to the President, the Secretary said that one of his conclusions from his trip to London, Paris and Bonn was that there is some disarray as between the British, French, and Germans on how to deal with the Soviet threat in Germany, and even danger of head-on collisions between the Western Governments in the next few months.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he had the feeling that each of the Governments concerned would think of him, the Secretary, as being in a position to <pb xml:id="pg_356" n="356" facs="0381"/>resolve the difficulties and avert the dangers. Hence, he thought, it would be most important that they not get the impression that the Secretary’s illness would remove his influence from the scene. The President indicated his general agreement. The Secretary thought that the phraseology of his letter adequate to cover this point, and asked that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName>, in responding to questions, bear it in mind.

<p>1797. Paris pass <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> and West.</p>
<p>A. In course visits London, Paris and Bonn during past week Secretary discussed Berlin contingency planning with British, French and Germans and presented US views re action which should be taken in event <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel substituted for Soviets at checkpoints. British, French, and Germans were receptive these views and, as Secretary stated publicly yesterday (February 9)<note n="1" xml:id="d171fn1">For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, March 2, 1959, p. 297.</note> on return to Washington, we are in general agreement as to procedures we shall follow if physical means are invoked to interfere with our access rights.</p>
<p>B. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. US conception of action to be taken is as follows:</p>
<p>1. If Soviets withdraw from functions they have heretofore exercised in connection with movements of Western occupying powers to and from Berlin, Three Powers should not acquiesce in substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials in performance of these functions. No stamping of papers or inspection by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials should be permitted. More identification of vehicles as those of one of Three Powers should be provided to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials on demand, but such identification should not be construed as acquiescence in substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for Soviet officials.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_357" n="357" facs="0382"/>
<p>2. Between now and May 27, Three Powers should take quiet preparatory and precautionary military measures of a kind which would not create public alarm but which would be detectable by Soviet intelligence.</p>
<p>3. The first movement (via the Autobahn) after the announced or attempted withdrawal of the Soviets should be one or more trucks from Berlin accompanied by scout car or other vehicle with shooting capability. This movement should attempt pass under conditions outlined paragraph 1 above. Effort should be discontinued if physically obstructed by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or Soviets. Movement would fire only if fired upon, in which case it should take whatever defensive action seems necessary.</p>
<p>4. If movement physically obstructed, consideration should be given to possibility of substituting personnel of Three Powers for Soviet personnel withdrawn from checkpoints. In any case traffic should be temporarily suspended and efforts should be made along following lines to increase pressure on both USSR and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>:</p>
<list>
<item>a. Effort should be made to mobilize world opinion against USSR as violator of agreements, user of force and threat to peace. Situation could be taken to Security Council. If USSR vetoed, situation could be taken to special session of General Assembly. Consideration should also be given additional diplomatic pressure in other forms, including withdrawal of Three Powers ambassadors from Moscow.</item>
<item>b. Military preparations should be intensified and could at this juncture include observable measures, for example, evacuation of dependents from Berlin and possibly from Federal Republic as well.</item>
</list>
<p>5. If above-mentioned diplomatic measures and military preparations not successful in restoring free access, Governments of Three Powers should decide whether to apply further military pressures through use of additional force.</p>
<p>6. Concurrently with development foregoing, Three Powers should continue their efforts to bring about Foreign Ministers’ meeting with USSR on the various aspects of German question by early May. These talks might provide cover which would facilitate modification or indefinite postponement by USSR of its “ultimatum” re Western Allied access to Berlin.</p>
<p>c. Re paragraph 1 above, Secretary also discussed without firm conclusion possibility of accepting <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel as agents of Soviet Union if they specified as such by Soviet government.</p>
<p>d. Embassy will note necessity of reviewing provisional instructions already agreed upon to assure conformity with above. We shall send further instructions this point.</p>

(Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> (Miscellaneous) Files: Lot 66 D 95, Records of Action by the National Security Council)</note>)</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> introduced the subject by noting that continuing study of alternatives to existing policy on the unification of Germany was called for by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action. He expressed the hope that in the absence of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, it would still be possible to have a report on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ recent trip to London, Paris, and Bonn. He then called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> who indicated that Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> would provide the report.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> stated that the purpose of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’s trip had been primarily to see whether our allies were thinking along the same lines as ourselves with respect to Berlin and the German problem generally. He added that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had had long and intimate talks with the leaders of the U.K., France, and Germany during his visits to the capitals of these three countries. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had expressed himself as completely satisfied with the results of his trip.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had found general agreement between himself and the leaders of the other three countries on proposals for dealing with the Soviets in the event of any attempt to impede allied military access to Berlin.</p>
<p>With regard to the problem of preparing for a possible meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the U.S., U.K., France and the Soviet Union, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had encountered few differences of opinion and even these were relatively minor and relatively easily adjusted. An agreed reply to the Soviet note of January 10 was now being considered by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council.<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3">See <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> briefly characterized what this note would probably contain.</p>
<p>Thereafter Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> described briefly the agreement reached by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> on procedural preparations for a Foreign <pb xml:id="pg_359" n="359" facs="0384"/>Ministers’ meeting. There had been discussion in all three capitals of the general problems of the Berlin situation, the unification of Germany, European security, and a German peace treaty. All had agreed that as the substantive basis for our position at such a meeting of Foreign Ministers, the President’s proposal at the Geneva Conference of 1955 should be used. This did not mean that there could not be certain adjustments in form and manner of presentation which might make this basis more palatable to the Soviets and to public opinion. In all three capitals Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had encountered a willingness to examine all the elements of such a package proposal. There was also a willingness to try to make such a package more palatable from the point of view of public opinion. There was not much optimism, however, on its acceptability to the U.S.S.R.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> then turned to the general atmosphere which the Secretary had encountered on his trip. In London he had found the Prime Minister and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> much preoccupied with domestic politics. While their position on Berlin was firm, it was not as truculent on this subject as had been the attitude in Paris. The British were open-minded in the matter of the review and presentation of the package proposal at a Foreign Ministers’ Conference.</p>
<p>In Paris Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had noticed a great change in <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> since his last meeting with him in December 1958.<note n="4" xml:id="d172fn4">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> met with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> at 4:30 p.m. on December 15; a record of this conversation is printed in vol. VII; Part 2, <ref target="#d81">Document 81</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> appeared much more friendly and much more relaxed.</p>
<p>In Bonn Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had appeared somewhat more flexible in his views than in the past with particular respect to the German contribution to the package proposal.</p>
<p>In conclusion Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he felt it desirable for him to state that despite Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ physical discomfort, he had never seen him so effective and so forceful as he had been in these meetings in London, Paris, and Bonn. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> repeated that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was extremely satisfied with the progress that had been made.</p>

<p>1779. Paris pass USCINEUR, <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>. From <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>.</p>
<p>1. Back here, after five days in Berlin,<note n="1" xml:id="d173fn1">A record of <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>’s 5 days in Berlin is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D 327.</note> have certain definite impressions. I think we must recognize Secretary’s illness, if it results in any long inactivity, will have distinct impact <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> foreign policy. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> has felt that <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ thinking closely parallels his own. Importance he has attached to personal interchanges Secretary must not be underestimated. There have been occasional et tu Brute episodes, but all short-lived. If Secretary does not attend conferences, we must expect more hesitations than in past, but fundamental loyalties will remain, especially if President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and Secretary from time to time send Chancellor reassuring personal messages.</p>
<p>2. Seems to me, United States policies regarding Berlin, and Germany generally, must be based on decision between two sharply conflicting schools of thought. One asserts Soviets are off balance because of: fears uprisings, and other preoccupations relative to East Zone. Other believes Soviets, uninfluenced by humanitarian, moral or spiritual considerations, are determined to preserve present domination East Zone, and corollary advantages, strategical, political and economic. I subscribe to latter interpretation. Psychological handicap having vast majority East German population opposed to an undisputed though brutal foreign rule probably does not profoundly disconcert Soviets. Nor, I guess, are they deeply afraid of possible riots, revolution or other potential manifestations unrest. If outbreak occurs, they have physical means at their command to suppress it, as they did Hungary. They are likely be more apprehensive armament Bundeswehr with atomic weapons, [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
<p>Moreover, do Soviets need be overly solicitous pretentions East Zone political leaders to assert national sovereignty? <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>, notably despised as he is by own compatriots, is faithful purveyor Kremlin doctrine. Better him, subservient to orders, than more independent nationalists capable creating schism and popular following. To increase his prestige by transferring controls would seem tactically acceptable, but to sacrifice him for larger purposes would not, I believe, offend Soviet conscience. They can regurgitate dogma without lasting indigestion.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_361" n="361" facs="0386"/>
<p>Therefore, our real adversary remains Soviet Union. If one adopts thesis its rulers in relationship to two Germanies, hold master cards as compared with our own, one must critically examine allegations West has failed diplomatically to achieve tolerable co-existence because of its own intransigence.</p>
<p>The Soviets have in East Germany a rich prize. Standard of living there is now probably higher than in Russia, and certainly superior to that in any other satellite country except maybe Czechoslovakia. Moreover, economic improvement East Germany can well continue to develop. Strategically, a portion of Europe, where troops by a mere about-turn can be poised to counter and subdue any adventure by reckless Poles or other satellites, must be considered a prime Soviet asset. Politically, if Soviets entertain genuine fears of a united Germany, its continued division must be welcomed by them, and I would surmise they would prefer for many reasons to have it permanent.</p>
<p>Various interpretations of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s possible motivations are current. But fact remains it is almost incredible, unless there is something more unstable in his character and authority than it would be safe to rely upon, that he would lightly abandon advantages derived from complete control East Germany unless promised concessions the West could only make to own evident disadvantage. Truth is, we now enjoy almost minimal position of strength in Berlin in contrast Soviet posture.</p>
<p>Existence of island of West Berlin, surrounded by hostile territory, results from political determination many years ago more remarkable for naivete than long range judgement. There is no use wringing hands futilely over consequences, but let us not compound past error by repeating it through a hasty retreat from our remaining essential bastions. Exodus from West Berlin and concomitant chaos, if American garrison withdrawn, would under present conditions, dwarf any other historical migration.</p>
<p>Flexibility as an end in itself appears to me singularly dangerous; it is not a policy; it can be an escape, above all when one has little to surrender except at the expense of one’s own security.</p>
<p>Is it really wise to jeopardize our national security through lacking the patience and wisdom to maintain our principles in foreign policy? In negotiating with the Soviets, can one expect quickly to arrive at formulae which will reconcile the most seemingly irreconcilable conflict of political philosophies the world has ever known? What losses have we suffered during the last decade in Western and Central Europe? It is customary to concede that we have been defeated in the propaganda field. What is the objective of propaganda? Is it not to create conditions where one gains a national or international advantage over opposing forces? Do transient polls, reflecting the natural desire in democracies for speedy and definitive resolutions of almost hopelessly complex questions, <pb xml:id="pg_362" n="362" facs="0387"/>accurately reflect the ultimate national interest of the United States? I venture to doubt it.</p>
<p>3. During last ten years; what has actually occurred in Western and Central Europe? The firm stand taken by the democracies has at least arrested, without territorial losses, the threat of Soviet take-over of these sympathetic and valuable populations. In Norway, France and Italy, for example, the power of indigenous Communist Parties has sensibly diminished; the prestige, authority, efficiency and popularity of governments openly opposed to communism have increased. Does that not signify significant progress, more persuasive than criticism of the inefficiency of Western propaganda?</p>
<p>Let us admit that public opinion—always [an] undefinable, vague bogey—demands more flexibility in U.S. foreign policy in Europe. Must it be placated, at the expense of our fundemental interests, by yielding to demagogic appeals, and by embracing plans, often devised by amateur diplomatic architects, eager to build on ground they have not surveyed?</p>
<p>If we had much we could safely yield, our choices would be simpler. But in Germany, and above all in Berlin, we are on the defensive. It is not we who can probe, embarrass, irritate. Our position in Berlin represents the minimum we would desire. To give an inch might lead to surrendering all; Munich stares us in the face.</p>
<p>How can we resolutely cling to our principles, and yet not betray them by an appearance, at least, of flexibility?</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a method. We have often said that deeds and not words are the measure of good faith. In the past, we have sought agreement with Soviets on reasonable agenda for conferences. We have rejected their insatiable and dangerous demands for accords at the expense of our survival. We have countered their suggestions by careful exposure of their fallacious reasoning and demands. But still we suffer and strain over the accusation of being inflexible.</p>
<p>Can we emerge from this trap into which we are said to have fallen without leaving not only our tail feathers but some of our vital organs behind? Must we sacrifice our principles—to appease the unenlightened reproach that we have not shown ourselves ready to capitalize upon assumed Soviet weakness?</p>
<p>The manner of negotiating may be, in public reflection, almost as important as the substance. Can we not advocate, indeed invite, debates without fixed agenda, battles royal with the Soviets, at every level, amongst Foreign Ministers, deputies, technicians (excluding only summit meetings unless so prepared as to make their success almost certain) which will, if the Soviets match our stamina, continue for months, even years? No longer should we reply in detail to Soviet notes, and bind ourselves through written counterproposals. Instead we should expose <pb xml:id="pg_363" n="363" facs="0388"/>ourselves to the hazards of debate, ready to discuss any offers made by the other side, no matter how unreasonable.</p>
<p>At least by this process we might penetrate the mystery of Soviet political intentions, especially as they bear upon the fundamental decision “between two sharply conflicting schools of thought” referred to in paragraph 2. There is no other way, except the one more likely to be productive, namely bilateral conversations between our official representatives and those of the USSR.</p>
<p>4. Being power conscious, the Soviets have long made it manifest they would like to treat bilaterally with us. Faithful to our alliances, we have refused to do so. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> has not been so scrupulous. Might we not, at some point, consider practicing the same technique? A trip, if practicable, by Secretary at an appropriate time to Moscow might yield interesting results.</p>
<p>If not, there still remains what I have already advocated; conferences without end, from which concord might finally evolve. If not, we would have lost little. The preparation of position papers has always absorbed more energy and talent than the shorter courses of international debate. And we could, if the presentation is adroit, lift ourselves out of the slough of inflexibility, and again struggle onto the high and defensible ground of principle.</p>

<p>1780. Paris pass <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>. While still on American soil, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> publicly attacked <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> by name. He singled <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> out as major obstacle to peaceful settlement <pb xml:id="pg_364" n="364" facs="0389"/>between Soviet Union and West, in Europe. He identified him with inflexibility, with implacable hostility not merely to Soviet Union but to any agreement. In so doing he was also attacking Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and attempting create gulf between these two statesmen whose close personal relationship well known and peoples of America and Western Europe whose yearning for peace could be satisfied, were it not for sinister collusion.</p>
<p>Personal attack <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> related to attack <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, and conjures up image renascent German militarism, and “furor teutonicus”, now barely held in check but liable emerge and break out again at any time and drag not merely Europe but whole humanity with it into apocalyptic holocaust.</p>
<p>Thus unholy association <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>, presented by Soviet leaders, not only prevents solution Europe’s problems, but contains within itself seeds destruction in the future. This may be said constitute major theme current Soviet political warfare, background against which Soviets formulating their tactical moves in period negotiation into which we seem be entering.</p>
<p>We believe it utmost importance be aware appeal which such theme likely have in coming months, unless West finds way educate public opinion so that goal Soviet policy as clear to man in street as technique by which Moscow hopes to reach it.</p>
<p>One of major trends in Western thinking recent months is illustrated by the extent to which public opinion now disposed take at face value expressed Soviet fears with regard Germany. Important we clarify our own thinking on this subject.</p>
<p>Generally agreed that Germany’s role in Soviet eyes is of different order from that any other foreign power. Recollections of last war, of formidable industrial and manpower potential German people, and of political processes by which inoffensive Weimar Republic was suddenly transformed into reality Hitler’s war machine, lend color and plausibility to fears this may happen again, notwithstanding disapproval and lamentations Western governments whose failure prevent this event 30 years ago seems suggest that they would again be powerless comparable circumstances. In Soviet political calendar next two or three years are no longer and no safer than time which elapsed between 1930 and 1933.</p>
<p>Easy for Soviet Union harp on these historical facts and evoke in minds peoples Western Europe who have also recently suffered so much from German aggression sympathetic response to basic thesis that Germany fundamentally still potential aggressor, which might in altered circumstances abuse weapons intended only for her defense, and embark once again on mad adventure. Assurances by West, expressed <pb xml:id="pg_365" n="365" facs="0390"/>in most formal and binding international agreements, such as the North Atlantic Treaty, do not carry full conviction, because they relate only to present international situation. Such assurances provide no convincing guarantee that future course events will respect their present validity. With such arguments, Soviet Union can exert powerful influence on Western popular attitudes. In proportion as rearmament Germany passes from planning and training stage to physical completion, so fears and warnings for future uttered by Soviet Union gain in plausibility and in political effectiveness.</p>
<p>Would emphasize that we here concerned less with sincerity Soviet propaganda when it points signs “revanchist” Germany, than with degree plausibility which such accusations may achieve, and consequent effect Western popular thinking.</p>
<p>When we ask ourselves what Kremlin’s real attitude is toward Germany, think we must accept fact that whether it sincerely believes in danger renewed German aggression or not, it will never renounce exploitation Western fears of militaristic resurgence Germany, for these fears are factor of great value to it in prosecution its long term policy: isolation and neutralization Germany, disintegration of Western defensive system, eviction US armed forces from European continent, and absorption Europe—in other words liquidation of the European front in world-wide Soviet campaign against United States.</p>
<p>This exploitation historical and emotional factors which militate in its favor takes specific form of warnings about consequences of the “nuclear rearming” Germany. Even though can be demonstrated that additional quota Western military strength represented by nuclear capability Western German <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces relatively marginal, Soviet Union can marshal powerful argument, which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has already used, which is, in our opinion, far more difficult to counter: that such nuclear equipment “in German hands” vastly increases danger that if, one day, German policy rests in hands of a “revanchist” madman (i.e.: type of German in whose role Soviet Union has cast <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>), Germany will be in position create incident, independently of will of Western Powers, which may prove uncontrollable and which will inevitably involve Soviet Union itself. In this hypothetical case, emphasis is laid on future irresponsibility and uncontrollability Germany, rather than on its role as an instrument of deliberate Western aggressiveness.</p>
<p>May be that this element in Soviet attitude toward the problem of Germany contains sufficient degree sincerity to justify most careful examination of possibility mutual concessions leading to stabilization situation Central Europe, so long as we adhere firmly to principle that our own security position must not be weakened as result any concessions we may make, and so long as we continue assume that even stabilization situation in Europe would not signify that Soviet Union had given up its <pb xml:id="pg_366" n="366" facs="0391"/>long-term goal of European domination, or the continuing exploitation of the means to reach it.</p>
<p>Vital importance adhering to basic principles our European policy underscores necessity our avoiding, particularly at this time, any course action, or posture, suggesting disposition compromise on these principles. This consideration prompts us express our concern at extent to which concept flexibility by West seems to be acquiring overtones willingness by United States to abandon some of premises on which our policy has hitherto been based.</p>
<p>It one thing retain our basic position and to cast about for ways presenting it more convincingly and attractively to public opinion in the West and elsewhere in the world. It quite another thing to hoist flag of flexibility as though it were kind of new rallying-point around which an entirely new strategy is to be planned. Flexibility in negotiating tactics, in willingness discuss all approaches to problem is desirable demonstration Western initiative. However we may already have reached point dangerously close to popular belief that West abandoning its former steadfastness, i.e.: its adherence to basic principles which have hitherto governed its policies in relation to Soviet Union and problem Europe. Widespread acceptance such belief would undermine Chancellor’s authority Germany, and would represent substantial victory for Moscow.</p>
<p>If we enter conferences this spring against such background popular expectation, we may be later faced with unpleasant prospect disillusionment in our own camp, and possible generation pressures which might drive some of Western governments to dangerous compromise.</p>
<p>Maybe we shall have, so to speak, to institutionalize international conferences, to be prepared wage continuous war [of] negotiation in public forum, at every level, with or without agenda or preparation (short of summit meetings), and to outlast the Soviet Union at conference table.</p>
<p>Out of this process, at some stage when substance of discussion has been exhausted, possible there will emerge in West sense of necessity for bilateral discussions between ourselves and Soviet Union. Feel we should be prepared consider such an eventuality, for which the preceding trial by conference would have set the stage for us and our Allies.</p>

</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he wished to take the occasion to review for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ambassadors residing in Washington the Secretary’s recent trip to Europe and other current developments regarding the Berlin issue and Germany as a whole. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> stated that the Secretary felt that his trip had been very timely and most satisifying in that it had assured himself and the foreign governments concerned that our and their thinking on the German issue was proceeding along parallel lines.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that in London the Secretary had talked with Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> and also with General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>; in Paris, with General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debré</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> and also M. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>; in Bonn, with the Chancellor and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName>. Part of these discussions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said, were devoted to procedural matters, such as our replies to the Soviet note on Berlin. The draft replies had in the meantime been circulated in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, and the finalized replies were delivered in Moscow today.<note n="1" xml:id="d175fn1">See <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_368" n="368" facs="0393"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that the Secretary’s talks had also dealt with preparations for a possible Foreign Ministers meeting with the Soviets. We anticipated in this connection that the Working Group, which had been meeting here during the past two weeks, would resume its meetings in Paris in early March. At that time they would devote their work to the substantive preparations for such a conference. It was expected that the four Western Foreign Ministers would subsequently meet together on the occasion of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Meeting here on April 2 in order to review the work of the Working Group. It was possible that the Ministers might also meet in the meantime, namely around the middle of March, depending on the progress of the Working Group’s deliberations.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that as the Ambassadors were aware, we considered that approximately May 10 would be the most convenient time for a meeting with the Soviets. There were, of course, no assurances that the Soviets would accept such a meeting: they might insist on a meeting of the Chiefs of Government or they might possibly object to the agenda, the composition, the location or the date. In any case, “the ball was now in the Soviet court”, and necessary preparations were going forward on our side.</p>
<p>With regard to Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said, there had been a reaffirmation by the Secretary and by those with whom he had talked during his trip of the December declaration maintaining our right to remain in Berlin, our right of access to Berlin and our refusal to accept a substitute of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authorities for the Soviet authorities. While it was feasible to make arrangements between co-victors, it was not admissible for one of the victors, namely the Soviets, to transfer their rights and obligations to the East German regime.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> added that there had been some discussion during the Secretary’s talks regarding the basic Western position in preparation for any meeting with the Soviets. There had been general agreement by those concerned that the basic elements of the proposals put forward at the two Geneva Conferences in 1955 should continue to constitute the foundation of our negotiating position, namely, reunification of Germany by free elections, establishment of an all-German Government, the right of such a Government to have a free choice in participating in collective security arrangements, assurances to the Soviets reflecting their concerns resulting from the reunification of Germany, practical security measures and finally a German peace treaty. It had been generally felt that the positions we had taken in 1955 were still basically sound and served to meet our own security requirements as well as giving reasonable satisfaction to Soviet security concerns. It was admitted at the same time, however, that a great deal could be done to embellish and improve these proposals without affecting their basic elements in order to make <pb xml:id="pg_369" n="369" facs="0394"/>them more persuasive. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> stated that we had accordingly been re-examining our detailed positions and their presentation. This, of course, was only in the preliminary phase and the real work would be undertaken by the Working Group in Paris at the beginning of March. Paris had been chosen as the site for such deliberations in order to facilitate consultations with <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, as had been done in the late spring of 1955. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> emphasized that it was our intention to keep <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> fully informed.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> mentioned that we were most disturbed by the speculative stories that had appeared in the press in this country and abroad regarding the Secretary’s trip and regarding developments in the Working Group’s meetings. Unfortunately, there had been some element of truth to some of these stories. On the U.S. side, we were accordingly taking precautionary measures and we felt that the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Governments would similarly wish to do everything possible to prevent any leaks, which would obviously be so damaging to the West in preparing for any negotiations with the Soviet Union. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> then opened the floor to questions.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Brosio</persName> (Italy) asked whether the mid-March meeting of the Foreign Ministers would have to be postponed until the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting here in view of the Secretary’s illness. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> replied that it had been originally planned that the four Foreign Ministers should meet in any case in Washington on the occasion of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting on April 2. It had not been definitively decided to have an interim meeting of the four Foreign Ministers before that time and this would depend largely on the progress of the Working Group’s deliberations.</p>
<p>Ambassador Urguplu (Turkey) asked what the State Department’s views were regarding Senator Mansfield’s recent speech on Germany.<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">For text of this address on February 12, see <hi rend="italic">Congressional Record</hi>, vol. 105, Part 2, pp. 2242–2321.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> replied that he would rather not comment on this matter. Our line was that we intended to give the most careful consideration to all thoughtful proposals. However, Senator Mansfield’s proposals did not represent the Administration’s policies and probably did not represent the views of the Democratic majority in the Congress.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> (Germany) asked whether any decision had been taken regarding the continuation of talks on contingency planning affecting Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> replied that he expected that these talks might go on here in Washington for one or more sessions and then would probably shift to Europe, where the people concerned were more familiar with the minutiae of the problems involved. Mr. Koht <pb xml:id="pg_370" n="370" facs="0395"/>(Norway) asked whether <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> would be apprised of the results of the talks on contingency planning. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> replied in the negative, saying this was the responsibility of the three powers and it did not appear to be an appropriate subject for current reports to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> (Germany) remarked that there had recently been a most unfortunate story in the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Sun Times</hi> regarding these talks.<note n="3" xml:id="d175fn3">Presumably a reference to the story in the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Sun Times</hi>, February 15, Section 2, p. 5, which reported that the Allies would send a convoy to Berlin that would refuse to deal with East German representatives if they were present. The convoy would then return to its starting point, while the Allies sought U.N. intervention. A second convoy would then be sent with orders to shoot anyone who tried to interfere with it.</note></p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> stated that given the ability and imagination of certain correspondents to develop speculative stories, he thought that in general it would probably be a mistake to try to deny or comment on such stories. To do so might indicate to the Soviets what our exact position was. He accordingly thought it was preferable to reserve comment. For that reason he hoped the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Governments would take this position into account and not be concerned if we failed to deny stories that were obviously incorrect.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> (France) stated that the French Government had now given instructions that nobody in the French administration, at no matter what level, would be permitted to talk to members of the press with regard to the Berlin issue or the overall issue of Germany.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Brosio</persName> (Italy) referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>’s statement about maintaining the 1955 proposals. He stated that he had observed in this connection that various elements of public opinion both in this country and abroad were now questioning the opportunity of maintaining this “package”. He added that the whole matter had been further complicated by the Berlin crisis. Whereas in 1955 there had been basically two issues—European security and German reunification; now there were the Berlin issue and the peace treaty, as well as European security and German reunification. The Ambassador accordingly wondered whether the same “package” proposals would be put forward again or would be subject to revision.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> replied that the composition and presentation of the 1955 proposals would be subject to re-examination by the Working Group. Nevertheless, it was felt that the 1955 proposals constituted the foundation of the Western position and that the basic elements of these proposals would not be changed without agreement. Certainly the search for flexibility should not lead us to adopt a position that is not in our overall interest. It was difficult, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said, to predict at this juncture what our final negotiating position would be, but he would be <pb xml:id="pg_371" n="371" facs="0396"/>very much surprised if the basic elements of our 1955 proposals did not continue to constitute our negotiating position.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> concluded by saying that the press might be curious as to why the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ambassadors had been meeting in the Department and suggested that in reply to questions, it be explained that the purpose of the meeting was to participate in a briefing for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ambassadors regarding the Secretary’s recent trip to Europe. It could be said that while a report had already been given to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, it had been felt that the Ambassadors of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries residing in Washington would be interested in getting a briefing firsthand.</p>
<p>Mr. Vigderman briefed the Icelandic Ambassador on February 17 along the above lines.</p>

<head>176. Editorial Note</head>
<p>Drafting a reply to the Soviet note of January 10 (see <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>) began at the end of January when first a French and then a U.S. draft reply were circulated in Washington. (Telegram 2683 to Paris, January 28, and telegram 6966 to London, February 1; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/1–2859 and 2–159) On February 3 representatives from the British and French Embassies met with State Department officials to begin work on combining these drafts. The following day, with the addition of West German representatives, an ad hoc four-power working group began formal consideration of the Western reply. The working group produced an agreed text on February 5 that was submitted to the four governments for comment. Further discussions resulted in final agreement on the text by February 10, after which it was transmitted to the North Atlantic Council for information and consideration. The U.S. Representative on the Council reported on the discussions of the draft reply in <gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss>s 2279 and 3313 from Paris, February 11 and 13 (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.00/2–1159 and 2–1359) and noted that full approval had been given by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members to the text.</p>
<p>The note, which briefly reviewed the evolution of the Berlin crisis and proposed a four-power Foreign Ministers meeting to discuss all aspects of the German problem, was delivered to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on February 16. For text of the United States reply, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, March 9, 1959, page 333; for text of the British reply, see <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 670, page 19, for text of the German reply, see <hi rend="italic">Moskau Bonn</hi>, pages <pb xml:id="pg_372" n="372" facs="0397"/>515–516; for text of the French reply, see <hi rend="italic">La Documentation Fran</hi>ç<hi rend="italic">aise, Articles et Documents</hi>, No. 767, February 24, 1959.</p>
<p>On February 13, having completed its work on the draft reply, the working group began consideration of substantive questions that might be raised at a Foreign Ministers meeting. The discussions led to the drafting of a nine-page questionnaire on these topics. (Airgram G–137 to Paris, February 16; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/2–1659) The working group recessed on February 16, after deciding to resume deliberations in Paris in March.

<p>Shortly after 11 a.m. on February 17, Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> briefed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the situation in Europe with particular attention to the Berlin question. After reviewing Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ trip to London, Bonn, and Paris and stating that he was “entirely satisfied” with the results, <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> explained the positions of the British, French, and West Germans on Berlin and described the meetings of the working group in Washington. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> stated further:</p>
<list><item>“The Secretary feels very strongly that if the Soviets are convinced of the firmness of the allied position to maintain its rights and position in Berlin, and access thereto, then there will not be a physical challenge on the part of the Soviets or the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to the exercise of those rights.”

It consists of saying there are other ways of bringing about unity, and free elections may follow rather than precede an agreement for the joinder of territorially separated parts of a formerly integrated country.</p>
<p>History affords examples to support argument that chronological relationship between free elections and unification need not require the first precede the second. But in most opposite precedents proofs of previous ill-faith were not present. Now, pledges given by Soviets for future performance should be judged in light past repudiation of equally solemn engagements. This would not preclude possibility of agreement to be implemented step by step, but should render us cautious over bartering away actual positions for future prospects.</p>
<p>Without entering upon analysis as to whether majority of West Germans, and especially their political leaders, really believe reunification soon achievable upon terms tolerable to them, position of West, including <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> Govt, has to date been postulated on such assumption. This has resulted in frozen policy, responsive to what people hope rather than expect.</p>
<p>Re-examination is in order, and beneath official surface is taking place in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. For a political figure of any prominence to abandon goal of reunification would be as dangerous as for him openly to advocate the most degraded immoral practices. He must either cling stubbornly to doctrine of reunification after free elections, or, if in opposition, assert only lack of imagination and of negotiating suppleness by executive has prevented this easy coalition.</p>
<p>However, increasingly, people and politicians of all parties here wonder whether unification, be it called confederation, is attainable on tolerable basis. Estimate of Soviet purposes confuses and divides them, according to individual views Soviet intentions.</p>
<p>Let us apply our attention to one preoccupation on which opinion is split. The Allies decided in 1945 to fragmentize Germany, despite apprehensions of the forces that might later seek to rejoin the severed members. Before long, both Soviets and ourselves mutually vied in protestations of will to reverse the process.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two states with different constitutional and ideological institutions had come into being. One turned freely toward West, the other, through duress, was polarized toward East. Although vast majority of East German citizens are anti-Communist, their volition is frustrated by their inability to implement it. In a police state, dissidents can[not] indulge in seditious thoughts without shaking totalitarian mastery.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_375" n="375" facs="0400"/>
<p>Nothing seems to justify assumption that Soviets will permit free elections as preliminary to reunification, in any form, of the two Germanies. Nor would promises of free elections, after some imperfect and partial constitutional framework had been erected, be trustworthy. But the Soviets have offered a scheme with which they hope to beguile the West: confederation, out of which credulous Westerners might hope would finally evolve, because of the supposed superior attractions of West for East, an entity strongly Atlantic and permitted by the Soviets to become such.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous illusion to cherish or accept. In such confederation, even if Soviet troops were withdrawn from German soil, and guarantees against re-entry were effective—an optimistic theory—the influence of the Kremlin over 17 million East Germans under a Communist, and not freely elected government, possessing juridical rights equivalent to those of 52 million West Germans, would be formidable. Yet, even if this were not the case, I suppose parties to such a confederation would already have renounced membership in the Warsaw or <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Pacts. This would be coupled with or lead to neutralization. Regardless of the size of armies permitted the two Germanies, effective neutralization of the Federal Republic would sound the death-knell of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s policy of the incorporation of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> in the Western European complex.</p>
<p>Monnet invented the so-called European idea. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> contributed to it the strongest and most consistent single support. Some accuse him, as is case with all successful politicians, of cynicism, lack of conviction in respect anything for which he would stake his political existence, without alluding to other instances in which he had demonstrated high political courage and deep moral sensibility, such as reparations to Israel. On one score I have never heard even his bitterest opponents question, even while criticizing, his sincerity; that is his passionate belief in the merit of encasing Germany in a veritable Western European straitjacket.</p>
<p>To destroy, entirely apart from military implications, <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>’s new-found allegiance to the West would be to kill the most promising development in Europe for centuries. One consequence would be to accept the prospect of a vital people adrift in Central Europe, without anchor or moorings, repudiated by friends, wooed by enemies.</p>
<p>I do not propose off-hand rejection of countless plans for settlement of German problems, but do urge that in approaching any design for German unity we bear constantly in mind that neutralization of the Federal Republic, and/or its withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would deprive us of our strongest ally in Europe, and turn Germany into a floating mine.</p>

<p>679. Re: Berlin. In connection Department’s consideration possible use <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as element in our policy in Berlin, I wish make following comments:</p>
<p>1. Action in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> prior to use of force would make such use more difficult and possibly prevent it subsequently, yet force may be only way keep our lines to Berlin open. Doubtful we can get votes for strong enough resolution to justify use of force later. Fear is too great among <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representatives of any action, however justified, which might bring clash between Soviet Union and US.</p>
<p>2. Bringing Berlin issue to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will inevitably lead to attempts compromise. If we rebuff these attempts, reject compromise, and particularly if we use force to maintain right of access while <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> processes going on, onus may shift to us and we appear be disturbers of peace rejecting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> procedures.</p>
<p>3. If we see possibility of compromise acceptable US, <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> might provide good forum in which develop it prior use of force. However, as I understand it, our policy is to refuse any compromise on our rights of access and to use necessary force to maintain that right. In that case, from standpoint of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action, we would be in better position if we use what force is necessary as soon as first <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> challenge comes. Simultaneously we should take issue to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, stating our case and reporting what we have done.</p>
<p>4. In these circumstances <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action would have proceed from fact our temporary control of access to assure our rights.<note n="1" xml:id="d179fn1">Next to this sentence in the source text was written “Sic!”.</note> We could focus <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> attention on easing immediate crisis. We would thereby avoid <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> attempt at compromise on overall Western and Russian positions in Berlin. We could, for example, introduce resolution calling for cease-fire and return to status quo ante of four power control and also for four power talks, possibly within <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> framework.</p>
<p>5. As regards <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> aspects, parallel is very close between present case and situation we faced last summer over Lebanon, although in case of Berlin we can base ourselves on acknowledged prior rights to which there was no counterpart in Lebanon. We would never have gotten <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> authorization to send our troops to Lebanon.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_377" n="377" facs="0402"/>
<p>6. Following such an appeal to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> we would take all possible steps avoid immediate emergency <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, for which strong pressure would develop, even within <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> membership. In <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, pressures for almost any kind compromise could well become so overwhelming as to jeopardize US best interests.</p>
<p>7. We could stall off emergency <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> in two ways. First, several proposals for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action could be initiated by ourselves and others which <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would have consider consecutively, requiring several days, and thus giving us time consolidate situation in area before <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> called. Second, we could continue within <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> press for four power meeting.</p>
<p>8. Such initiatives in Council, especially calls for four power talks, would appear as effort shift dispute back onto diplomatic plane, in accord with overwhelming desire <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members prevent spread of conflict.</p>
<p>9. We could increase apparent flexibility our position and increase impact our. proposal for four power conference if we were also willing suggest possibility heads of state meeting also within <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> framework to follow successful Foreign Ministers conferences as we suggested last summer. This was a good formula which, if properly applied, would not have endangered our interests.</p>
<p>10. Thus, we would have initiative in seeking peaceful solution, while actually enforcing our right of access to Berlin. We would also have initiative on summit issue through procedure we could control.</p>
<p>11. From point of view of maintaining best public posture for possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action, I also agree with Berlin’s 680<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">Telegram 680, February 10, discussed how vehicles and convoys to Berlin might be identified and noted that once some identity paper was shown to a <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> official at any checkpoint it would be very difficult to prevent him from stamping it in some way. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/2–1059)</note> that we have clearer situation if no documents shown <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials at all. We must keep focus on main issue, namely whether or not Soviets unilaterally can transfer to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control of our access to Berlin in violation our rights and against our protests. We must stand directly on principle in such way that our actions cannot be misinterpreted as quibbling. We must not let Soviet entangle main issue in debate by making it appear “Western powers risking war over legal technicality of processing documents.”</p>

<p>1649.1. Stimulated by Bonn telegrams 207 and 208<note n="1" xml:id="d180fn1">Printed as telegrams 1779 and 1780, <ref target="#d173">Documents 173</ref> and <ref target="#d174">174</ref>.</note> venture submit following reflections on German problem. Should Soviets accept our proposal for Foreign Ministers meeting, it is possible they would replace <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> with someone like <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>, in which case we should be prepared for serious substantive negotiations on both Berlin and Germany” as a whole. If they are represented by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, we should be prepared for what on general German question would be largely propaganda exercise, although there might be serious negotiations on Berlin problem. I suspect they will so play matter as to lead to impasse and call for summit meeting. If any major settlement is to be reached <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will certainly wish obtain full credit for it himself and I do not believe he will reveal through <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> concessions he might be willing make to settle German problem. I suggest therefore we should give serious consideration to a summit conference either in event Soviets reject our present proposal or following Foreign Ministers’ meeting which bogs down.</p>
<p>If Soviets carry out their threat of concluding separate peace treaty with East Germany, and I am inclined think they will, we may not have another opportunity to have serious attempt to settle German problem with them by negotiation. Alternatively I suggest we should be prepared engage in bilateral talks (not negotiations) with objective of ascertaining whether summit meeting could successfully be held. Despite alarm this might cause our Allies I do not believe there is one of them who would not have done so already were they in our place and I believe that if properly explained they would not seriously oppose such a step. It appears to me there is less danger in such top-level talks without agenda than there is in lower-level meetings suggested in para 3 Bonn’s 207, since danger of low-level meetings is that without carefully prepared and agreed positions one or more of our Allies are likely to make concessions and our position gradually be whittled away.</p>
<p>2. I personally attach more importance to our propaganda position than appears indicated by Bonn’s <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>s. In my opinion if we can put forward reasonable-appearing proposals it will be more difficult for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to carry his associates with him on his present line of policy with real risk of war which this involves. Moreover such proposals, <pb xml:id="pg_379" n="379" facs="0404"/>since they would appeal to public opinion of our Allies, should assist us in holding our Allies together and in maintaining our unity in what threatens to be very severe test of nerves. I would quite agree with Bonn that we should not abandon sound positions for transient propaganda advantage and any proposals we put forward should be such as we could live with should they be accepted by other side. There would appear, however, to be proposals which would have little chance of acceptance by Soviets but which would greatly strengthened our position before world opinion.</p>
<p>Greatest weakness our present position in my opinion is that it is unrealistic for us to expect Soviets either now or in future to agree to reunification of Germany on basis prior free elections, since such elections would certainly result in resounding slap in face to them and would have repercussions in Communist Bloc, particularly in Poland, which we cannot expect them to accept. Even if Germans had completely free hand to reunite their country they would be obliged maintain for transitional period much of economic system prevailing in East Germany and some changes (such as division of large estates) would doubtless have to be accepted as permanent.</p>
<p>It seems to me, therefore, that our proposals could provide for a transitional period of from three to five years and perhaps for separate referendum in East Germany on question whether they desired an autonomous economic and social system in a united Germany. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> indicated Soviet belief that in two or three years they could raise living standards in East Germany to something approaching those of West Germany. While I doubt that even if they are successful in this they could make the present regime acceptable to many more of East German people, they probably believe they could strengthen position of Communist Party and possibility of socialist cooperation with it in an eventual reunited Germany and could in some such period of time reduce damaging effect which reunification would have on Communist Bloc.</p>
<p>3. Apart from chain reaction effect on Communist Bloc principal obstacle to Soviet acceptance of settlement German problem is strategic. Here again I question whether our present proposals are realistic or represent good propaganda position. While we state we do not seek military advantage from reunification, fact remains that if our proposals were accepted Communist Bloc would not only lose more than two hundred thousand East German troops but most of these would eventually be added to Western strength. Moreover they would be deprived of certainty of their access to East German industry for military not to speak of ordinary economic production and psychologically their prestige would have been greatly diminished.</p>
<p>While I confess it is extremely doubtful that we could devise settlement satisfactory to us which Soviets would accept at present time, there <pb xml:id="pg_380" n="380" facs="0405"/>is much that in theory at least we could offer which would be tempting to them. I am not in a position to judge what kind of solution US could accept with safety but wish to suggest what Soviets might buy. I do not believe Soviet military would now support <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in accepting settlement which would leave Germany member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. We conceivably could put forward a step by step plan which would envisage Germany’s eventual withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> provided we made it clear Germany would be free to participate in European integration organizations of economic, political or social nature such as Common Market and Coal and <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> Community. A provision against membership in military alliances and against foreign bases along lines of Austrian Treaty provision<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">For text of the Austrian State Treaty, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 6, 1955, pp. 916 ff.</note> would, I think, be acceptable to Soviets. Another proposal to which Soviets would attach importance would be settlement of German-Polish frontier problem.</p>
<p>They would also attach great importance to any proposals for thinning out or withdrawal of Allied troops from Germany and to prohibition on Germany’s possession of atomic armaments. Any settlement that involved these factors and by a transitional period provided against a sudden shock to Communist Bloc would, I believe, have real chance of acceptance by Soviet Union. They would be prepared to accept similar atomic limitations on Poland and Czechoslovakia and be prepared withdraw their troops from Germany to Soviet Union in step with our withdrawal. If these military steps were phased with steps leading to reunification of Germany I should think risks involved, when considered in relation to alternatives, might be acceptable to US. As to whether West Germans could be brought to agree and whether such proposals could even be suggested to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> without shaking his confidence in us I have no opinion. Assume French would also be difficult.</p>
<p>4. With respect to Berlin question I believe that if we and our Allies can maintain firm and united front <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would accept any solution enabling him to claim to East Germans and his own people that something had been accomplished by his move. Great danger lies in possibility of misjudgment on his part as to what our intentions actually are. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit will be particularly important. In considering various possible solutions I suggest we should have in mind present unsatisfactory legal basis for West German access to West Berlin.</p>
<p>5. If we expect Soviets to discuss seriously reunification of Germany, believe we should be prepared discuss German peace treaty. We might consider whether it would be worthwhile attempting at proposed <pb xml:id="pg_381" n="381" facs="0406"/>conference to negotiate terms of peace treaty for Germany as a whole with thought this would influence terms of probable separate SovietEast German treaty if conference fails. In any event, suggest we should go to conference prepared with text of peace treaty acceptable to us.</p>
<p>6. It is true that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, merely by putting his Berlin proposal forward, appears to have succeeded in shaking our confidence in our position, and has gained at least a temporary advantage. On the other hand, I question whether that position, however just it may have been, was ever negotiable. Today when West may be faced with decision involving real risk of nuclear war, it does not seem to me we can go to conference offering as only alternative to Russian roulette in which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> threatens to engage us, a restatement of proposals which we know Soviets will almost certainly refuse. If we are sufficiently sure our Allies will stay with us and will make our position unmistakably clear to Soviets in advance, perhaps we can run risks of such a deadly game. If not and if we do not have realistic new proposals to put forward for settlement of German problem as whole, then I believe we should have ready a compromise solution for Berlin question. If we were able to advance clear and reasonable proposals for a settlement of the German problem, we would be in strong position to stand firm on Berlin issue.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/2–1859) No other record of this meeting has been found.</note> Following is text memorandum on Berlin contingency planning handed British and French Ambassadors February 18. Slight corrections suggested by British and French as given in bracketed text are acceptable to us.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_382" n="382" facs="0407"/>
<p>“The re-examination of Berlin contingency planning which has been undertaken on the basis of the United States aide-mémoire of December 11, 1958<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">See <ref target="#d98fn5">footnote 5, Document 98</ref>.</note> would be facilitated by a more precise description of the measures which would be taken to deal with and to prepare for a situation in which the USSR attempted to withdraw from its present functions with respect to the access of the Three Powers to Berlin and in which officials of the so-called ‘German Democratic Republic’ (<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) refused to allow the traffic of the Three Powers to pass without submitting to some form of control.</p>
<p>“Agreement should therefore be reached at this time on the more detailed plan of action outlined in paragraphs 1 through 5 below.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">“1. Measures To Be Taken Immediately</hi>:</p>
<p>“(a) The Three Powers will continue their efforts to bring about a Foreign Ministers’ meeting with the USSR on the various aspects of the German question by early May [French suggested ‘as indicated in instructions to Ambassadors at Moscow’ instead of ‘by early May’]<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3">All brackets in the source text.</note> bearing in mind that one of the purposes of such a meeting would be to provide the USSR with a cover which could facilitate the modification or the indefinite postponement of its ‘ultimatum’ that it will withdraw from its functions with relation to the Three Powers’ access to Berlin after May 27.<note n="4" xml:id="d181fn4">In the Soviet note of November 27, 1958 (see <ref target="#d72">Document 72</ref>), <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> declared that if the Berlin question were not resolved in 6 months, the Soviet Union would sign a separate peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic.</note></p>
<p>“(b) In view of the possibility that the USSR may nonetheless withdraw from these functions and in order to provide evidence of the Three Powers’ determination to maintain their free access, the Three Powers will, in the period between now and May 27, take quiet preparatory and precautionary military measures of a kind which will not create public alarm but which will be detectable by Soviet intelligence. These measures will be planned and co-ordinated by the military headquarters of the Three Powers in Germany.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">“2. Initial Probe of Soviet Intentions</hi>:</p>
<p>“After the announced or attempted withdrawal of Soviet personnel from the access checkpoints, the first Allied movement via the Autobahn will be one or more trucks from Berlin accompanied by a scout car or a comparable armed vehicle. If necessary, the vehicles will be identified to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials as vehicles of one of the Three Powers, but no stamping of papers or inspection by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials will be allowed. The <pb xml:id="pg_383" n="383" facs="0408"/>movement will proceed toward Helmstedt until its passage is physically obstructed. It will not fire unless fired upon, but if fired upon will take whatever defensive actions seem necessary.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">“3. Possible Substitution of Allied for Soviet Personnel</hi>:</p>
<p>“At that juncture the Three Powers should consider the possibility of substituting their own personnel for the Soviet personnel withdrawn from the Nowawes and Marienborn checkpoints.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">“4. Efforts To Increase Pressure on USSR and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss></hi>:</p>
<p>“If the initial probe [French suggested adding ‘or probes as’] described in paragraph 2 above is physically obstructed, the Three Powers will temporarily suspend surface traffic and will make parallel efforts along the following lines to increase pressure on the USSR and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>:</p>
<list>
<item>“(a) The Three Powers will seek to mobilize world opinion against the USSR as a violator of agreements, as a user of force, and as a threat to the peace. The situation could be taken to the United Nations Security Council and, in the event of a Soviet veto, to a special session of the General Assembly. Consideration would be given to further forms of diplomatic pressure, including the withdrawal of the Ambassadors of the Three Powers from Moscow.</item>
<item>“(b) The Three Powers will intensify their military preparations. At this point the preparations could include measures which would be readily observable, for example, the evacuation of dependents from Berlin, and possibly from the Federal Republic.</item>
</list>
<p><hi rend="italic">“5. Use of Additional Military Force</hi>:</p>
<p>“If the measures described in paragraph 4 above do not suffice to restore the free access of the Three Powers to Berlin, the Three Governments will decide [British suggested adding ‘after appropriate consultation’] whether further military pressures should be applied by the use of additional force.</p>
<p>“The attitude of the Three Powers towards dealing with personnel at the Nowawes and Marienborn checkpoints should be also defined more precisely with respect to two points.</p>
<p>“The first of these relates to the so-called ‘agency principle.’ The Three Powers cannot deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel as Soviet agents if the USSR denies that such an agency relationship exits. If, however, the USSR should ultimately propose a compromise under which the USSR, as principal, would expressly authorize <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel to function as Soviet agents in performing Soviet functions with relation to the access of the Three Powers to Berlin, the Three Powers should consider the possibility of accepting such a compromise solution, with appropriate safeguards for their own rights.</p>
<p>“The second point involves the practical problem of identifying the vehicles of the Three Powers at the Nowawes and Marienborn checkpoints <pb xml:id="pg_384" n="384" facs="0409"/>in order to establish that they constitute an Allied military movement enjoying the right of unrestricted passage between Berlin and West Germany. If Soviet personnel are withdrawn from the checkpoints, there would be no objection to providing mere identification of the vehicles of the Three Powers for the information of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel at the checkpoints. Such identification should not, however, include the stamping of papers or any other form of inspection or control, and it should not be construed as acquiescence in the substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for Soviet personnel. The Three Embassies at Bonn, after consultation with the military headquarters of the Three Powers in Germany, should determine the appropriate procedure for identifying the vehicles of the Three Powers and incorporate this identification procedure in the detailed instructions which the Embassies are now developing for Autobahn travel by military convoys and vehicles and by the privatelyowned vehicles of official personnel of the Three Powers.”</p>

<dateline><placeName>Moscow</placeName>, <date when="1959-02-23">February 23, 1959.</date></dateline>
<p>I promised to send you a further message today giving you my impressions.<note n="1" xml:id="d183fn1">In a message delivered on February 22 <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> promised to give the President a report on his visit to Moscow following his first formal meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>) For <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s account of his visit, see <hi rend="italic">Riding the Storm</hi>, pp. 592–632.</note> Although I have only been here 48 hours some of these are already quite clear. From the way in which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> talked to me throughout yesterday when we were out in the country it was borne in on me that in spite of their great new power and wealth the Russians are still obsessed by a sense of insecurity. The old bogey of encirclement has not yet been laid. Like a poor man who has suddenly made a fortune they feel uneasy in their new situation and they are resentful and nervous of their neighbours. Whenever <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> mentioned the Germans it was possible to sense his hatred and distrust of them.</p>
<p>I believe that these feelings of apprehension are just as real as are their misconceptions about Western policy. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> treated me to a diatribe about mistakes which the West had made in the past and about evil intentions which it had nurtured towards Russia. He said that we had made a wrong assessment of the situation after Stalin’s death. We had counted on internal difficulties to enable us to extract concessions. We had even thought “Liberalism” might appear in Russia. We had tried to impose conditions and had followed slogans of containment, roll-back and liberation. Such concessions could not be wrung out of the Soviet Union. He did not accuse us of actually wanting war but said we had created an atmosphere of war.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_386" n="386" facs="0411"/>
<p>On Germany and Berlin I detected no signs that there was any weakening in their purpose. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that there was no room for manoeuvre or retreat from the position they had put forward. He repeated all the usual logic-chopping arguments in support of his proposals for a free city and for a peace treaty with the two sides of Germany. He said that they insisted on this position “because they saw no other way out”. Berlin, reunification, peace treaty, European security were different questions. Some were more ripe for settlement than others. But in our reply of January 10<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">Apparent reference to the Western response of February 16 (see <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>); the Soviet note on Germany is dated January 10 (see <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>).</note> we had tried to bring them all together. He distrusted our proposals which looked to him like an attempt to draw the Soviet Government into a labyrinth of negotiation which might last for 9 or 10 years. I tried to explain why it was impossible for us to accept their proposals. I said that if the Soviet position was altogether inflexible as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had indicated the situation was very serious indeed.</p>
<p>For the next day or so I propose to leave it at that and to turn discussion to other topics. We have made a start on disarmament on which they seem ready to be a little more forthcoming. They are at least prepared to discuss in practical terms questions now at issue at a nuclear tests conference. Their attitude is dominated by their conviction that we shall exploit inspection for purposes of acquiring military intelligence; but even so they are open to argument on procedures of control.<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3">Printed from an unsigned copy.</note></p>

<dateline><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1959-02-24">February 24, 1959.</date></dateline>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName>: Thank you very much for the message giving your impressions after forty-eight hours in Moscow.<note n="1" xml:id="d184fn1"><ref target="#d183">Document 183</ref>.</note> I have no doubt that the conclusions presented in your first paragraph are quite accurate.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_387" n="387" facs="0412"/>
<p>We are of course aware of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s apparent rigidity with respect to the Soviet attitude toward Berlin and Germany. This morning, February twenty-fourth, we received cabled extracts from the statement that he made today in Moscow<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">For text of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech to the workers of the Kalinin district of Moscow, February 24, in which he insisted on a summit conference to solve the German question, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>, February 25, 1959.</note> that are seemingly even more belligerent and unyielding than those he has made in the past.<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3"><p>In a draft attached to the source text the following paragraph appears at this point:</p>
<p>“Moreover, at the very moment he is insisting that a Foreign Ministers meeting is out and that there should be a Heads of Government meeting, he tells you, as the Head of a major Western Government, that the Soviet position on these vital questions permits no room for maneuver. In effect he is saying that even a Heads of Government meeting would be completely useless except as it would give opportunity for a combined surrender by the West to the East.”</p></note></p>
<p>Presumably the conversations which you and he are carrying on should be producing a better atmosphere in which the West and the East can negotiate. By <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s own words he had no apparent interest in such a development. For example, he is quoted this morning as saying that, if the West should attempt to maintain contact with Berlin either by ground or by air, such an attempt would be considered a “threat of war.”</p>
<p>To attempt to draw any conclusion as to his basic purpose in such statements would be nothing more than an exercise in speculation. However, it seems that he is intensifying his efforts to create division within the Western group and thus to weaken our resolution. In effect he is saying, “We are destroying the Western rights in Germany and in Berlin, and if you make any attempt to defend those rights you are guilty of aggression and warlike acts.”</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning I shall probably have some searching questions put to me by the press respecting the latest statement of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and the rigidity of the line he is taking.<note n="4" xml:id="d184fn4">For the transcript of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s press conference on February 25, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>, 1959</hi>, pp. 208–218.</note> I shall say as little as possible, particularly during the duration of your visit. However, I believe I should reiterate that the West is a unit in its determination to defend its rights and to carry out its responsibilities respecting Berlin, and that, while we are completely ready to negotiate where there is any possible negotiable ground, we are not going to be divided or defeated by threats.</p>
<p>With warm regard,</p>
<p>As ever,</p>

<p>702. For <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>. Reference: Berlin.</p>
<p>1. Pursuant Acting Secretary’s authorization to acquaint <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> with gravity with which US Government regarded possible developments re Berlin, I saw <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> yesterday noon.<note n="1" xml:id="d185fn1">On February 21 <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> had authorized <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> to inform <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> of the extreme concern that the United States had about the Berlin situation. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., UNA Files: Lot 61 D 91, Berlin)</note> Conversation turned out to be, on this subject, equally desired from <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName>’s side.</p>
<p>2. After relating deep concern in highest civilian circles of US Government that Soviets might, from unobjective assessment of US opinion, miscalculate regarding basic unity of American people with regard to foreign policy in general and Berlin situation in particular, I expressed in strongest possible terms what I understood to be firm determination to stand on our rights in Berlin and, if necessary, to defend them even at risk of war.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName>, without batting an eyelash, expressed view that any hostilities in Western or Central Europe could not possibly be limited and would inevitably lead to outbreak of full-scale war. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he did not for a moment himself misunderstand American opinion regarding Berlin. He said he had “become enough of an American” since being here to realize and discount domestic political game and not mistake it for basic cleavage in outlook where national interests were concerned.</p>
<p>4. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said his own desire to discuss this with us had come from his reading of two articles in <hi rend="italic">NY Times</hi> Sunday and Monday<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">February 22 and 23.</note> on Berlin situation. He noted in both articles an apparent intention to involve <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> without, so far as he was aware, any explicit appreciation of what was possible. He said he saw <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s role in Berlin controversy in two categories: (a) as constructive forum or springboard for action such as four power talks or other negotiations which could lead to an end or easing of present crisis; or (b) as kind of cloak for action already determined on which could, as an abuse of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, both mark beginning of end for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> itself and neither lessen present tension nor contribute to any real solution of problem. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> was concerned that, at this stage, both Russians, in their off-hand references to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in Berlin, and West, as reflected in Washington and Bonn <hi rend="italic">NY Times</hi> stories, seemed to be taking latter road.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_389" n="389" facs="0414"/>
<p>He strongly hoped this was not case and urged we do everything possible avoid misusing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in this fashion, or putting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in what he called “false position”. He stressed that using <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as cover and nothing more would produce adverse reaction in majority of members.</p>
<p>5. He felt nothing of clear nature could be known re Russian intentions before conclusion of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s visit to Moscow. In his opinion, “pipe and tweed approach” of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> could not fail to produce something present attitude regarding Berlin. At another point he referred to conversations with Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Willy Brandt</persName>, who, he said, did not for moment doubt there were “back doors” in Soviet position.</p>
<p>6. Having given matter considerable thought, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s guess as to Soviet motivations was that East Germans have been “nagging” Soviets and are seeking to wring some concession, by way of increased status for their regime, from USSR. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> further believes Soviets basically do not want to risk all-out war. Therefore, he surmises, problem as seen from Soviet eyes is how much of concession Moscow can make to East Germans without endangering their basic “no war” policy. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> sees many shadings in possible concessions Russians might give to East Germans. Their action might be confined simply to turning over East Berlin to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, without any role for <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in connection with access of Western Powers to Berlin. Next on scale could be grant of certain low-level functions to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> at checkpoints without any real authority. Beyond such minor measures, Soviets could of course grant more extensive powers to East Germans. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> inclined believe Russians will try to get away with minimum concessions necessary to keep East Germans happy.</p>
<p>7. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he will undoubtedly be faced with considerable discussion of Berlin situation while he is in Moscow. In order to be of value in development of situation, he feels he ought to be acquainted as much as possible with thinking of Western Governments at latest possible moment before his arrival in Moscow on 24 March. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dixon</persName> (UK) has promised provide him with full report on <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s visit. He hoped US might for its part be able to give him last minute assessment either in sealed written form through Swedish channels in Washington or by calling it to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow if time did not permit pouch delivery from Washington before his arrival. By then, he said, we would have been able to assess results of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit as well as having taken into account any nuances detectable in further Soviet utterances this subject.</p>
<p>8. As far as <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role is concerned, he will for present continue to take, as he has so far, line that it is too premature to go into. He said he could not at present moment, given his present lack of information on <pb xml:id="pg_390" n="390" facs="0415"/>what is basically at stake, come up with any concrete suggestions as to any role <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might play in Berlin.</p>
<p>9. In closing this part of conversation, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> reiterated his concern, as indicated above, that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could be placed in “false position.” Having emphasized this point so strongly, he seems to us to want to be kept fully in picture as our planning may progress on use of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He also seems genuinely concerned at possibility we would hide behind <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s skirts and then proceed to direct action, using as justification our having gone to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and exhausted all possible remedies short of use of force.</p>

<p>1687. I find it difficult to judge what is maneuver in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech<note n="1" xml:id="d186fn1">See <ref target="#d184fn2">footnote 2, Document 184</ref>.</note> and what is his genuine and firmly held position. From toughness of his speech it would appear that he has judged <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit and such developments as Mansfield speech<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">See <ref target="#d175fn2">footnote 2, Document 175</ref>.</note> as signs of weakness and he is evidently convinced he can exploit <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit to his advantage. There have been many indications that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is so determined upon a summit meeting that he is deliberately building up tension with a view to bringing this about. Whether at such a meeting, if it took place, he would be willing to make genuine effort reach reasonable settlement is certainly open to question but I think it is quite clear that he will not reveal his hand on any lower level. In judging his speech suggest the following considerations should be taken into account.</p>
<p>I believe <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is genuinely convinced Foreign Ministers’ meeting would not resolve any major problems and would be used by US to probe Soviet position and drag out negotiations interminably. I believe he is also convinced that if Germany remains tied to West and no <pb xml:id="pg_391" n="391" facs="0416"/>agreement is reached on prohibition atomic tests it will eventually obtain atomic weapons and be in position to threaten Soviet Satellites and possibly involve US and USSR in military conflict. Even though this may be true of West Germany alone he believes his possession of East Germany reduces threat and particularly threat to instability of Communist regime in Poland. As indicated by <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> in US<note n="3" xml:id="d186fn3">See <ref target="#d121">Documents 121</ref> and <ref target="#d135">135</ref>–<ref target="#d137">137</ref>.</note> and by Kosygin to me yesterday,<note n="4" xml:id="d186fn4"><persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> discussed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech and the Berlin question with Kosygin at a reception the night of February 24. (Telegram 1686 from Moscow, February 25; Department of State, Central Files, 761.13/2–2559)</note> Soviets apparently believe that by raising standard of living in East Germany they can consolidate hold of Communist regime there in next few years particularly if Berlin problem can somehow be resolved. At any rate he doubtless considers that reunification at later date would be less damaging to Communist Bloc than now, as not only would they be able to show progress in East Germany and build up support for Communist Party, but also by that time Soviet Bloc will in his opinion have further successes and be better able to accept a retreat if this should become necessary. A further factor in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s thinking in my opinion is that he is convinced that neither British, French nor West Germans genuinely desire German reunification and basing himself on this he assumes West will in the end accept continued division and settlement of Berlin question in manner which will consolidate this division. It would also appear that he has taken our willingness to have East Germans present in Foreign Ministers’ meeting as further indication we are prepared accept continued division. As he puts it “if you accept a you must accept b.”</p>
<p>French Ambassador informs me that in conversation with him last night <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> confirmed main points his speech but with three additions. He mentioned that Poles and Czechs should participate but without “voix deliberative”.<note n="5" xml:id="d186fn5">“The right to speak and vote”.</note> He also said that if they did not succeed in obtaining our agreement to a peace treaty they would proceed to conclude one with East Germany just as we had done with Japan. He also indicated that Foreign Ministers’ meeting could follow summit meeting.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s conversations should throw further light on Soviet tactics and policies but before Soviets have made formal reply to our note it would seem advisable that if we express any reaction it should be strong one and it would be preferable for it to come first from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> rather than from us. From what I have heard however this appears unlikely.</p>

<p>Dear Friend, Thank you very much for your message of February 24.<note n="1" xml:id="d187fn1"><ref target="#d184">Document 184</ref>.</note> You have just about summed up what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is in effect saying to us. In fact I used very much the same words when I was telling him today what I thought his attitude amounted to.</p>
<p>I think that I had a pretty useful conversation from our point of view and that it left him disappointed. I would not respond to his pleas that I should advance some fresh proposals for Germany and Berlin. I stuck to the point that nothing that he could do would extinguish our rights of access to Berlin and our determination to do our duty by staying there. I said that it was he who was threatening us with war and not the other way round and that this kind of thing did not square with his professed desire to settle our differences by negotiation. The two positions taken up by each side were not reconcilable. Since it was no use his thinking that he could force us to abandon our rights and our duties he must make up his mind to negotiate with us in a sensible way. As to the level and agenda of negotiations I was not going to argue about that with him in Moscow. He must answer our Note of February 16<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">See <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note> and we would then consult with our allies.</p>
<p>Atmosphere has been very cool since his speech of yesterday. I have told him Doctor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> whom he had insulted was my friend and that I hardly believed that he would think well of me if I did not stand by my friend. I said that precisely because the situation which lay ahead was so dangerous I must make it absolutely clear to him that the British Government would stand by and cooperate with their allies.</p>
<p>Almost the only point on which we found ourselves in agreement today is that the situation might in fact become extremely serious. I do not pretend that I have shaken his resolve any more than he has shaken ours. On the contrary all indications are that he means to go ahead with his plan for turning over approaches to Berlin to D.D.R. and for making a peace treaty with them. But at least I hope that my language may have had some good effect in making him realize the strength of our determination and what is involved.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_393" n="393" facs="0418"/>
<p>It is on this rather dark note that I am now leaving for a four day journey around Russia. I thought that you would like to have my latest news before I set off.</p>

<p>711. Re: Berlin. I went to lunch which Sobolev<note n="1" xml:id="d188fn1">Arkady A. Sobolev, Soviet Representative to the U.N. Security Council.</note> gave as <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> President today. He greeted me at door and asked me how I was. Conversation paraphrased as follows:</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>: I am worried about the news from Moscow which seems to represent a dangerous state of mind. I am afraid of hazardous events taking place. I wonder whether the Soviet Government understands that Americans are both firm and undivided on the subject of Berlin. I am not worried about dangerous incidents if the Soviet Government proceeds on correct information, but I fear they misinterpret the informal and apparently casual character of domestic politics as indicating division.</p>
<p>Sobolev: I have not seen the text of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s statement and could not comment on it, but I am sure that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> knows very well that there is no division in the United States on the subject of Berlin. I believe <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> brought back to Moscow the thought that America is united on that subject. I agree that the Soviet Union should understand the true state of affairs in the United States. But the United States should understand the true state of affairs in the Soviet Union.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_394" n="394" facs="0419"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>: I am well aware of the Soviet Union’s fear about Germany. I understand why the Soviet Union, having been devastated in World War I and again in World War II by the German Army should have these feelings.</p>
<p>Sobolev: If you really understand why we feel as we do about Germany, you would understand almost everything we do. I don’t know what you are worrying about. We are not about to shoot.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>: But are you not going to block roads and take steps of that type?</p>
<p>Sobolev: You must understand that we definitely intend to get out of Berlin. If there are no negotiations ahead of time there will be a very serious situation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>: Why then don’t you have a Foreign Ministers’ meeting to conduct such negotiations?</p>
<p>Sobolev: There should be a meeting at the summit. They can do more than a Foreign Ministers’ meeting can do. In connection with the press report of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statement remember that the press exaggerates everything. There are 100 press people in Moscow who are there for the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit. There are few news sources in Moscow and they simply make a lot of things up.</p>
<p>During lunch I talked to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> about this conversation. He believed that the motivation for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s statement was fact that he was being nagged unmercifully by East Germans. He thought Sobolev’s insistence on summit meeting was due to fact that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wanted to come to New York, saying that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had childish streak in his nature and was resentful at not being taken seriously everywhere. He thought that after job which New York police did in protecting <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>, there was no significant security risk in bringing <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> here.</p>

<p>1895. From <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_SAHV1">Van Scherpenberg</persName> sent for me last night at insistence Chancellor (home nursing cold without fever) and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> (home <pb xml:id="pg_395" n="395" facs="0420"/>with bad case influenza). Said they and himself, despite efforts comply with US request to advance ideas regarding solution German problems felt they had nothing novel to contribute. Whatever views they had in security field they were reluctant to put forward lest they seem to disregard what might be American security interests far more important than their own. I could develop nothing from this cryptic statement, which I personally feel reveals what already reported by Embassy: (1) difficulty obtaining constructive suggestions from <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>; (2) dissatisfaction of Chancellor with Working Group papers, including German, thus far prepared.</p>
<p>State Secretary continued that, because of above situation, they would welcome a visit to Bonn before March 9 Paris meeting by some high level Dept officer, preferably <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, with whom they could have frank and secret discussions. This could take place March 6, 7 or 8 and last only a day. He asked if I saw any objection. I answered I knew the officers named were even busier than usual, and could venture no guess as to availability. Second I thought, especially under prevailing circumstances, visit to Bonn would be misconstrued in other capitals and give rise to widespread speculation. He responded US officer could also go Paris and London.</p>
<p>I asked what, if anything, he wished me to do. He said if I had no objection, they would transmit request through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>, and would I please support it. I told him I would report it, that nothing would please me more than to have <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> come here, such talks would indeed be useful, but Dept alone could decide as to availability or advisability.</p>
<p>My own reaction is that it has always been productive to have Secretary, or failing him, some high Washington official in whom Chancellor has confidence, see him, hear his latest comments on foreign policy and relate our own. Under such circumstances I believe he talks with greater freedom than he does to his own associates. At present, he is preoccupied over his talks with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> on March 4, and those he will have later with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, as well as fear Working Groups Paris may develop undesirable plans. In addition, he is naturally very concerned over Berlin, reception <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in Moscow, etc. However, in this instance, I think the timing is bad, and Soviets as well as others might construe and propagandize such meeting as showing uncertainty on part West.</p>

Re: <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> meeting (private) February 28. <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> Meeting called at UK request to present <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s “preliminary impressions” Russian attitude. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> found no signs weakening Russian intention turn over to East Germany May 27 control access to Berlin and sign peace treaty. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not give <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> prior notice Feb 24 speech but covered much of ground subsequently covered in speech. Re disarmament, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> showed no keenness resume surprise attack talks<note n="1" xml:id="d190fn1">Documentation on the surprise attack talks at Geneva, November 10–December 18, 1958, is scheduled for publication in volume III.</note> but hoped heads of govt could reach agreement on security which would benefit both sides.</p>
<p>In discussion following UK report, <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> stated now clear West would be faced with crisis May 27 and he worried re slowness development Western position and lack preparation Western public opinion for May 27 showdown. Discussion also brought out possibility there would be no four-power conference on Germany or Berlin. Need for full discussion in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> emphasized. US stressed importance firm Western position in face situation likely to arise on May 27. <hi rend="italic">End summary.</hi></p>
<p>UK Perm <gloss target="#t_rep1">Rep</gloss> stated he had been asked by <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> give <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> impressions which not necessarily final views, at conclusion formal talks with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Unlikely further discussion scheduled for March 2 would add anything new. Felt Russians still obsessed by sense insecurity, bogey encirclement and apprehension re neighbors—this in spite of their new power. Soviet leaders convinced West putting pressure on them since Stalin’s death in belief Soviet weakened internally.</p>
<p>Re Germany and Berlin, in addition to points noted above, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> claimed he distrusted Western proposals as putting too many questions together and designed draw Soviets into long inconclusive discussions. Russians insist on their proposals. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> apparently chose regard <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s statement UK would stand firmly by Western Allies and uphold Western rights in Berlin as threat. Had reiterated intentions re turn over access to Berlin and signature peace treaty. Said “Soviet Govt would regard any subsequent violations of <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> as act of war”.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_397" n="397" facs="0422"/>
<p>On disarmament, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> detected some slight give. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> skeptical of disarmament commission but thought Heads of Govt might find “mutual interest in some system of security of advantage to both sides”. Was suspicious that inspection scheme merely device for espionage but concerned at possible acquisition of nuclear weapons by other powers.</p>
<p>Non-aggression pact not mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
<p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> question, UK Perm <gloss target="#t_rep1">Rep</gloss> said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had not indicated whether West would get formal replies to notes November [<hi rend="italic">January</hi>] 10. In response Belgium question, said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had not raised with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> subject of summit talks. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> also told UK Delegation he intended trip to Berlin and Leipzig after conclusion UK visit.</p>
<p>US thought it very wholesome <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> considering new situation in such serious fashion, pointed to very thorough and serious consideration being given to problem by govts, and thorough public discussion. Recognized we had already advanced several concessions, as Belgian Perm <gloss target="#t_rep1">Rep</gloss> noted, which had had no response. Speaking personally thought there seemed evidence Soviets do not want conference and even if one held might not help Berlin situation. Therefore Alliance must face firmly what may happen on May 27. Thought major importance attached to insuring that Alliance strong and united enough to find way to deal with that situation.</p>
<p>Re preparing Western public opinion, admitted govts have not revealed positions but called attention to extensive public debates in Parliament, Congress and elsewhere which certainly focused public attention on problem. Thought four powers fully recognized importance of preparing Western public opinion.</p>
<p>Council agreed that response inevitable press enquiries re subject this hastily called <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> session, would be “no comment”.</p>
<p>Canada agreed with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s general remarks. Thought Canadian Govt would take line no question of procedure should stand in way of meeting with Soviets before May 27, or at least setting date for such meeting. Felt there was something to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s remark that too many questions being put to him. Priority may have to be given negotiation of Berlin question. Concluded this may be last time West can discuss German problem in four-power context.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> underlined importance Canadian statement and warned that at some point there will be great temptation place problem before <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. If this happens, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can only work out compromise which not in <pb xml:id="pg_398" n="398" facs="0423"/>accord with Western position. Did not blame <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but it is its business to work out compromises.</p>
<p>Belgium noted West had hinted concessions re free elections and some degree recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Asked why we could not make concession of giving Russians summit meeting they wanted. Emphasized Russians had already rejected four power meeting and wondered whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would not continue to insist on including Czechs and Poles.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>, in addition to points noted in summary above, observed it was clear negotiations with Russians impossible. Soviet position legally inadmissible but difficulty was no court existed before which West could argue case. Must admit that when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> alleged there was nothing in Western reply of February 16 he was not entirely wrong for that note procedural only. Admitted <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> had been given ample time comment on Western reply but nobody had done so.</p>
<p>Lack of Soviet good faith makes difficulty for West in dealing with its public opinion. We must prepare this opinion for Soviet move May 27. Folly to face Western opinion with grave situation without preparation. Worried lest little progress in developing substantive position be made during working group sessions Paris and noted Ministers now not meeting until first part April.</p>
<p>UK thought on contrary working group would make considerable progress.</p>

Following is summary discussion today in which British and French Ambassadors presented their Governments’ views on our February 18 Berlin contingency planning memorandum. (Department’s G–397 to Bonn).<note n="1" xml:id="d191fn1"><ref target="#d181">Document 181</ref>.</note></p>

<p>1. After discussion <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> proposal that coordination should take place Washington of preparatory military measures contemplated para 1 (b) G–397 following language suggested as substitute for last sentence para 1 (b): “Recommendations for preparatory measures, regardless of origin, will be referred to national Chiefs-of-Staff and thereafter be coordinated tripartitely or <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-wide as may be agreed, bearing in mind the availability of military advisers in Washington.”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said he could accept this and <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> agreed refer to Paris. Consensus appeared be that measures affecting forces in Germany should be coordinated in first instance in Germany.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> questioned whether direction of initial probe discussed para 2 G–397 should be from Berlin to Helmstedt or vice versa. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed question of direction could be left open although on balance probe from Helmstedt to Berlin might be preferable.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> questioned practicality of substitution Allied for Soviet personnel discussed para 3 G–397. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> explained background this suggestion is legal concept Four Powers have joint tenancy of Autobahn and Three Powers would succeed to Soviet rights if latter withdraw. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> suggested we might raise this idea at some earlier point in discussions with Soviets, pointing out to latter we would have right to take over if they withdraw and seeing how they react. Was agreed words “at this juncture” should be omitted.</p>
<p>4. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> expressed reservations about recourse to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> suggested para 4 (a) G–397, fearing that attempt use <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as means of mobilizing world opinion against Soviets might result in getting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> involved in substance of German problem, which would be very undesirable. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> took position <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representatives of Three Powers should urgently study feasibility using <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in manner proposed. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out recourse to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to mobilize opinion suggested only as possibility, that tactics would have to be worked out, but that we considered it possible get favorable vote in Security Council. Was agreed feasibility and advisability of recourse to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to mobilize opinion should be studied by three <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representatives on urgent basis. Was also agreed “or other” should be inserted after “diplomatic” para 4 (a) G–397.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> inquired whether military preparations discussed para 4 (b) G–397 excluded garrison airlift and stated garrison airlift should be instituted at this point even if land operation contemplated. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied we did not exclude such airlift as eventuality but did not believe it necessary make concrete preparations now and fear the psychological effect of leaks of information we are preparing for airlift. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> referred to problem of maintaining civil air traffic to Berlin and said air traffic problem may develop into passenger airlift problem.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_400" n="400" facs="0425"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> added para E December 11 aide-mémoire<note n="2" xml:id="d191fn2">See <ref target="#d98fn5">footnote 5, Document 98</ref>.</note> should now be made mandatory. Was agreed additional paragraph should be included in memorandum (text to be worked out later) instructing Embassies at Bonn to proceed with various aspects of air access contingency planning.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> suggested economic countermeasures might be used as pressures in addition to military pressures discussed para 5 G–397. Was agreed omit redundant words “by use of additional force” para 5 and add sentence “Supplementing military pressures, consideration might be given to possible economic measures.”</p>
<p>7. Re agency question discussed penultimate para G–397 <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> suggested we might adopt active rather than passive role and put matter to Soviets in following terms: “If you wish to divest yourselves of your rights and obligations, this must be done in the appropriate form. The rights are your affair, but in handing over to the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> you also hand over the obligations towards ourselves. We are willing to accept a formal assignment to the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> on condition that (a) we do not recognize the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> as a Government but as the authority designated by you for this purpose, and (b) you yourselves, and the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> as the authority designated by you, guarantee to us that the obligations which you have incurred will continue to be carried out.”</p>
<p>8. Re identification procedures discussed last para G–397 <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said British might be prepared accept time-stamp, perhaps on separate piece of paper, as appropriate means of identifying Allied movements. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> reiterated US objection to any stamping of papers by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> added British acceptance language para 2 G–397 re initial probe was understanding words “stamping of papers or” omitted. Assume British will take this position when Three Embassies study identification procedures.</p>
<p>9. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> inquired whether and when it was contemplated warning to Soviets per para A US December 11 aide-mémoire would be sent. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said British did not want further communication to Soviets until latter reply to February 16 notes. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated we had no firm opinion on what “appropriate time” for such communication would be and pointed out we had made our case to Soviets in part in our protest against recent delay in clearance of convoy at Helmstedt.</p>
<p>10. It was our understanding British and French Governments accepted memorandum subject to comments above.</p>

<p>1954. For <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> from Acting Secretary. Re urtel 1895.<note n="1" xml:id="d192fn1"><ref target="#d189">Document 189</ref>.</note> German suggestion that <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> visit Bonn next week presents such serious difficulties that we doubt it would be feasible to arrange this. In these circumstances there seem to be two alternative responses to this request on which I would like to have your views urgently.</p>
<p>A) The first alternative is following letter from me to Chancellor, which you could deliver or which could be delivered to <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> if he transmits the request mentioned in your <gloss target="#t_tel1">tel</gloss>:</p>
<list>
<item>“I have received a message from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> which gives me the impression that you may be feeling uneasy about developments, particularly about the direction which a quadripartite review of our positions might take. The Ambassador indicated that you might like to see one of our senior officers whom you know, such as <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Bob Murphy</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Livie Merchant</persName>. Much as I appreciate your concern, I think this would not be feasible in the present circumstances. In the Secretary’s absence, both are carrying additional burdens, of course, and both are well enough known that some harmful speculation might result from a trip to Bonn.</item>
<item>“As you know from your talks with the Secretary and from the fact that he was our careful selection to place next to so esteemed a friend, the President and the Secretary have full confidence in the discretion and judgment of <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">David Bruce</persName>. I hope that in these present circumstances you will feel confident that you can talk with him with complete freedom and frankness. We do need the benefits of your thoughts.</item>
<item>“I hope that this message will find you in the best of health.”</item>
</list>
<p>B) The second alternative would be to reply orally, explaining difficulties noted in A about sending somebody to Bonn, expressing full confidence in you, and saying that we are prepared to call you home at once for consultations. You could thus bring with you any thoughts that the Chancellor particularly wants us to have and further receive from us our latest thinking, for you to communicate to him on your return. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. I envisage that under this alternative you might in addition to having useful substantive consultations here in Department, be able also to call on Secretary briefly and possibly on the President. While such calls cannot be assured in advance, perhaps if arranged they would serve to <pb xml:id="pg_402" n="402" facs="0427"/>strengthen the impression of close consultation between us and German Government, which seems to be latter’s principal motive.</p>
<p>If any other way of dealing with this request commends itself to you I would, of course, welcome your suggestions.<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">On March 1 <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> replied that alternative A should not be used and that an oral statement either by him or an official of the Department of State to <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> was warranted only if the Germans requested it. (Telegram 1898 from Bonn; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/3–159) On March 2 <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> discussed the question with <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> who stated that it would be physically impossible to have a senior officer visit Bonn. But <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> would go to Paris for the second week of the working group meetings, then visit Washington before returning to Bonn to brief the Chancellor on the latest U.S. position.

<p>1899. Paris pass <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>. From <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>. On basis assessment contained Moscow 210 Feb 19 to Dept<note n="1" xml:id="d193fn1">Printed as telegram 1649, <ref target="#d180">Document 180</ref>.</note> as to improbability German settlement being agreed by Soviets unless there were prospective withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and other concessions to attainment reunification in freedom, I should like to make following observations.</p>
<p>I wonder if generally accepted theory that division of Germany constitutes immediate threat peace of world is sound. Partly because of belief in this theory, coupled with moral distaste for inhuman separation of kindred peoples, West has supported certain policies directed at achieving reunification.</p>
<p>But is this division really a primary source of dangerous tensions, or has it become mere symbol of underlying US-USSR power struggle, exploited by each side to influence public opinions? The conflict between free world and international communism is global; its manifestations in Germany are local expression of hostility between irreconcilable political philosophies.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_403" n="403" facs="0428"/>
<p>The West is not under dire pressure, except in Berlin, to give up its present posture in Central Europe and consent to German unity on basis other than free elections. The attack is rather directed against its defensive commitments, alleged by Communists to be dangerous and aggressive while cloaked in garb of being defensive. As regards Berlin, undoubted peril exists that rejection of Soviet proposals might create conditions suceptible engendering global war.</p>
<p>Perhaps Soviets have welcomed and wish perpetuate contention over German unity, for opportunities it gives them denounce war-mongering Western planners, and “revanchist” designs <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> leaders. Hoping ultimately to yoke both Germanies to Communist chariot, they try to exploit Western insistence reunification issue by dangling prospect realization this goal in return for far-reaching concessions.</p>
<p>What are concessions most attractive to Soviets? Certainly, those calculated further to advance their ambition to subvert <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>, diminish and finally eliminate its dependence upon and affiliation with Atlantic Bloc. To accomplish this, I would judge they consider dominance over East Germany consolidates a major center of European operations, with strategy determined by and commands issued from Kremlin. Moreover, East Germany is that Soviet asset most likely to disrupt Western solidarity if adroitly and temptingly utilized.</p>
<p>If, as argued in recent telegrams (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>s 1779, 1780, 1795)<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2"><ref target="#d173">Documents 173</ref>, <ref target="#d174">174</ref>, and <ref target="#d178">178</ref>.</note> Soviets, on balance, may be rather contented with actual control over Pankow, and unwilling relinquish existing position of strength and consequent capacity to confuse, frighten and embarrass West, except in return for detachment of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> from Western allegiance, concessions they would demand for any weakening their own position are likely to be greater than West, in its own interests, can afford to pay.</p>
<p>So long as Soviets may believe end our policy toward Germany is to bring about reunification, they will demand much and give little. People in East Zone, though unreconciled to Communist regime, have learned how to live with it, though unwillingly and under duress. Many of the most vigorous have fled (leaving a gap in resistance leadership), but the vast majority can not do so, and are progressively impelled to adjust themselves to their lot.</p>
<p>Soviets may wish to maintain truncated Germany for strategic, political, economic, security advantages. To allow unity two Germanies in freedom would strip them of such advantages, and increase whatever fears they entertain of German vitality. If they already apprehensive lest rearmed <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> might, through military adventurism, draw them into <pb xml:id="pg_404" n="404" facs="0429"/>world conflict, how much more might they fear potential of 17 million more Germans added to those already inimical?</p>
<p>For many reasons, would seem to me logical Soviets would prefer Germany divided, as permanently as possible, unless confederation on conditions dictated by them feasible. If so, one assumption heretofore made by some Western politicians and commentators requires reexamination, namely, that Soviets might be induced to make deal over future of Germany on terms sufficiently reasonable to satisfy West, because Soviets, to avoid continuing dangers German problems, would make sacrifices to have Germanies united rather than separated.</p>
<p>Unless Working Group preparing Western position reaches realistic estimate value to Soviets present control East Germany, I anticipate it may advocate dangerous compromises in illusory hope tempting Soviets some reunification plan.</p>
<p>It may be that negotiations with Soviets will bring out hard choice that may be confronting US; either retention <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> in Atlantic complex, or German reunification on terms exposing <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> to Communist domination by weakening Western security position. Unlikely Soviets would permit US shelter in half-way house. If such choice had to be made, I would unhesitatingly select former alternative, even though price paid for it might well be provisional renunciation of hope or expectation of a reunited Germany.</p>
<p>We should ground US policy on refusal to admit any impairment of attachment of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and other Western institutions, and permit no diminution of its equal rights and obligations in relation thereto. For better or worse, <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> must be treated by US with full confidence; to discriminate against it and reduce it to second-rate and limited partnership would be to invite later infidelity.</p>
<p>Monolithic <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> will, I believe, until dying breath, demand continued incorporation of his Republic in Atlantic Community, no matter what cost in frustration elsewhere. But in his own party, and to greater extent in the opposition, are many who, fearful, uneasy, might barter away present <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> independence, as an equal amongst equals in Atlantic Community, for what might prove to be only temporary accommodation with Soviets. This is particularly true under present circumstances when they are agitated over what may result from Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>If above analysis is even half correct, we must be armed against surprises, and ready to establish our own minimum conditions in any interchanges with Soviets. I, for one, would concede them nothing in the way of retreating from our existing, and not unfavorable or untenable, status in Europe. If they undertake to dislodge us from it at risk of general war, I should rather accept that risk now than later. It may be West Germans <pb xml:id="pg_405" n="405" facs="0430"/>and other Allies will seek to undermine our determination, by advocating (though unlikely on part of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> while <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> lives) <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> departure from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a concession to Soviets on reunification.</p>
<p>As to European security proposals, we should be ready to debate them, but remain resolved to preserve at all costs <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>’s full association with the West. The only permissible exception might be limitations in military field if, after profound examination, we decide that such measures are fully consistent with the maintenance of a security position in Europe at least as favorable to us as present one, and if similar limitations apply to certain other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact powers, so that <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> is not singled out for discrimination.</p>
<p>However, important bear in mind possible political repercussions agreement between Soviets and ourselves involving limitations on, or changes in disposition of, Western troops, particularly American. Any such agreement likely be publicized by Soviets, as well as Western press, as promising first step on road relaxation of tensions, thus encouraging Western public assume and expect corresponding progress political field. Unless even limited measures military agreement reflect at least some degree substantial progress toward solution political issues, they may unleash prematurely unjustified optimism and harmful diminution of will resistance Western peoples.</p>
<p>It is, I imagine, likely that our position in Berlin is such that best we can hope for there (and then only in light determination if necessary, to resort to nuclear war) is to maintain status quo, with constant threat of having Soviets or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> persevere in their harassment. Our present position is one we may only be able sustain by unilateral action. For though General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, a man of fixed principles, seems unyielding in his attitude, forces he can devote to world conflict are deficient in modern armaments and, as consequence of their actual deployment, unlikely to contribute to our strength. As for British, their diplomatic and national habits, their pragmatic approach to international problems, persuade them to deal with facts, not hypotheses, and often to make plans only after the event. However, once die were cast, if war ensued, they would, as always, be most dependable of allies.</p>
<p>So, if we go it alone, in the direction of nuclear war, we can certainly not count on full support until after our own forces are about to be committed. In case of West Germans, even so stout a friend as the Chancellor has revealed decided hesitation over awful prospect of recourse to total war.</p>
<p>If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> rejects our proposal for Foreign Ministers’ conference, think we would find our Allies unwilling to avoid summit conference. In such case, would deem better to have such conference take form of meeting of Chiefs of State in New York, under auspices of Security Council, with opportunity afforded for private conversations between <pb xml:id="pg_406" n="406" facs="0431"/>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> <gloss target="#t_tel1">tel</gloss>s to Dept circular 998, 999, 1000).<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">Circular telegrams 998, 999, and 1000 transmitted to Bonn, Paris, London, Berlin, and Moscow the texts of telegrams 711, 710, and 716, February 27, from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>. (Circular telegrams; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/2–2759) Telegram 711 is printed as <ref target="#d188">Document 188</ref>. Telegram 710, February 26, reported that the idea of a summit meeting at the U.N. Security Council had great merit. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/2–2659) Telegram 716, February 26, transmitted <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>’s ideas on the merits of taking the Berlin question to the Security Council before the Soviet Union transferred its functions to the East Germans. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note></p>
<p>If this does not take place, or fails to establish agreement, and there is no bluff on either side, Soviet or American, the issue may be joined, not inadvertently, but because both sides have gone too far to beat retreat. At this point, last chance would be to have President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, either by personal message to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, or in hastily arranged meeting with him, emphasize shattering effects of failure to solve Berlin problem.</p>
<p>But how can Berlin problem be solved in any forum without sacrificing freedom of West Berliners, or, even graver in long run, leading to detachment of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> from West? The abandonment by US of Berliners would destroy confidence in our engagements everywhere, even in those uncommitted countries that presently criticize our announced intention to maintain our rights and protect those who rely on us.</p>
<p>I had hoped Berlin problem need not be treated in isolation, but could be dealt with in connection with consideration of larger affairs, in which it could be softened and absorbed. This may no longer be possible if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> holds to his recent utterances. Therefore, at least for planning purposes, we must prepare for situation where fate of Berlin will depend on understanding between USSR and ourselves being reached.</p>
<p>If any understanding be possible, what considerations should govern our conduct of negotiations? First of all, honor. We are pledged not to abandon people of West Berlin. But even if actual unsatisfactory status quo were continued, prospects for future are dim, for whether it be Soviets or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> who give turn of the screw, we will still be vulnerable. Our position is minimal, we have nothing to trade except out of our flesh and blood. To yield little is to yield everything. It is most unlikely that the Soviets or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would regard, as has sometimes been suggested, the closing down of <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss>, or the curtailment of our intelligence operations, as really significant. What they want is the whole hog. And, in the absence of our unshaken will to plunge, if required, into a nuclear conflict, they are in position at worst to subject Western occupants of Berlin to almost unbearable strains or, at best, to drive them from it, denuded of honor and prestige, and expose US particularly as paper tiger.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_407" n="407" facs="0432"/>
<p>How can we make successful sortie out of this beleaguered fortress? We must first consider psychology of West Berliners. They are almost blithely confident of our ability to protect and will to stand by them, and of faith in our guarantees to do so. No alternative solution would be satisfactory to them unless they felt it provided a degree of security equivalent to that represented by our present commitment, which implies our willingness to sacrifice perhaps tens of millions of American lives rather than give up Berlin.</p>
<p>Is there any such equivalent? Almost certainly not withdrawal of our garrison, and replacement of its functions and our guarantees by United Nations police force, and some vague supervision by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> of inviolability of the city. Nevertheless, study should be given to variants of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence and responsibility.</p>
<p>It would not be in interest of free world, as I have earlier argued, to give the quid of discarding <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> as Western colleague for a doubtful quo which might not succeed in preserving actual status in Berlin. What then might be the basis for possible deal?</p>
<p>I repeat, we must be prepared and ready, if all else fails, to wage nuclear war against Soviets. But short of that, if they too would seek to avoid such catastrophe, is there common ground on which we could meet? Perhaps by removing Berlin entirely from the arena of political conflict, thus eliminating it as a prize, subject to conditions acceptable to its citizens and to German opinion. Of all schemes proposed, the Spaatz Plan,<note n="4" xml:id="d193fn4">Not further identified.</note> in this respect, appears to me the most appealing. Internationalize the area, preferably including also East Berlin, by making it seat of United Nations and converting it into United Nations territory. This may sound impracticable, but governments might do unexpected things, if alternative appeared to be destruction of most of human race.</p>
<p>If this were accomplished, West Berliners might feel secure. Presence of thousands of foreigners, derived from every country, might constitute an acceptable solution, if they were themselves convinced it provided a guarantee of their independence and freedom, at least equivalent to that represented by our present commitments. Indeed, to the skeptical, it might be more reassuring than dependence, year after year, decade after decade, on almost incredible resolution of their erstwhile Western enemies, whom they had so grievously wronged, to protect them indefinitely at such potential sacrifices.</p>
<p>Intelligence reports from Berlin seem indicate settled Soviet intention turn over their responsibilities to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Since they can reverse their position overnight, it would be part of wisdom for us to anticipate this might happen at any time, even before the date of May 27.</p>

<p>“March 2, 1959.</p>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName>:</p>
<p>Following your return to London, I hasten to felicitate you on the firmness of your presentation respecting Western rights in the Berlin situation. At the very least you demonstrated to the world that strength does not depend upon discourtesy, a great contrast to the provocative attitude and statements of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> during your visit there. Thank you very much for the care you took to inform us on a day by day basis of your Russian experience.</p>
<p>I assume that you are now going to visit both Bonn and Paris. I assure you once again that you will be most welcome if you find it <pb xml:id="pg_409" n="409" facs="0434"/>desirable to come to Washington. We could have a most informal meeting, without any social engagements, and should have a day or two of good talks while you are here. I am quite sure that nothing is so important as to have our ideas and plans concerted among the four of us and, so far as possible with the complete <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> group. Certain elements of the situation constantly change so it is extremely important that our agreements and our plans are in accord therewith.</p>
<p>Do let me know as soon as convenient whether you can come and approximate timing.</p>
<p>With warm regard,</p>
<p>As ever,</p>
<p>Ike</p>
<p>P.S. Just as I was finished dictating this note, I had yours that was written apparently the first thing Monday morning.<note n="1" xml:id="d195fn1">In this one-page message, dated March 2, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> noted that the atmosphere in Moscow had improved and that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had shown <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> an advance copy of the Soviet reply to the Western note of February 16 (see <ref target="#d194">Document 194</ref>). <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> commented that there was “a lot of the usual tiresome stuff” in the note, but that the last paragraphs deserved careful study.

(Telegram 1773; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.00/3–959)</note> This message directed solely to procedure and handling of reply to <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> note.<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">See <ref target="#d194">Document 194</ref>.</note></p>
<p>I believe situation has changed as result <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit. British are convinced that meaningful discussions can be held only with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and I agree with this conclusion. I also believe British will stick with us on Berlin issue when chips are down but before doing so they will insist upon negotiations even if we have to accept unfavorable terms re agenda or composition in order bring this about. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> indicated to me that British have in mind possibility suggesting some kind of more or less permanent commission to negotiate with Soviets. I very much doubt Soviets would buy any such plan. Would appear that both British and French are very weak on parity issue. I do not believe that Soviets will agree to Foreign Ministers agenda which implies any discussion of reunification. British officials on <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> delegation indicated they would be prepared to press further for acceptable agenda for Foreign Ministers meeting but were anxious that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> note not be “flung back at them” or rejected outright in view of British feeling that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> proposal for Foreign Ministers’ meeting was concession made by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as result <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s conversations here.</p>
<p>In view foregoing I believe that if we are to insist upon Foreign Ministers meeting and if we are not prepared to yield on parity, our realistic alternatives are a Foreign Ministers meeting either without agenda or one confined to Berlin problem.</p>
<p>My own view is that we should adopt one of two alternatives, first, a summit conference limited to four powers with provision for German consultation and without agenda. This should enable us to satisfy British necessity for negotiations before risking war over Berlin issue and to find out what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> really has in mind. I believe he wants summit meeting badly enough that on this basis he would probably drop parity issue. Also believe he would in fact discuss reunification at such meeting but would not accept agenda which clearly implied commitment on <pb xml:id="pg_411" n="411" facs="0436"/>his part to do so. I question argument that summit meeting would worsen situation by disappointing expectations of peoples of world if such conference failed. I do not believe <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would consider it to his interest to allow such conference to fail completely; believe that as minimum he would agree to instruct Foreign Ministers pursue some of problems that would be raised at such conference. Soviets have already indicated this in their last note.</p>
<p>Second alternative would be bilateral US-Soviet talks at top level, preferably in my opinion invitation to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit US. In talking to me <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> observed that democracies were greatly handicapped in dealing with Soviets since reaching agreement among big three and later in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was so difficult and consumed so much time that Soviets always appeared to have initiative. He said British had this in mind in making present visit. Clear implication these remarks was that British would not object to bilateral US-Soviet discussions along lines their own talks.</p>
<p>Greatest disadvantage of these two alternatives is that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might take them as sign of weakness and harden his position but if I am correct in assumption that because of our Allies we will have to have meeting with Soviets before final showdown on Berlin then it seems to me that it would be better to propose such meeting now than later when Soviet threats will have become more immediate.</p>

<p>The Secretary had read the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> communiqué.<note n="1" xml:id="d198fn1">For text of this communiqué, see RIIA <hi rend="italic">Documents on International Affairs, 1959</hi>, pp. 11–13.</note> It struck him that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> has given in on the issue of a conference with the Soviets, to the extent that he, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, is now associated with the Soviet position on the agenda. The Secretary also noted that the ideas <pb xml:id="pg_412" n="412" facs="0437"/>about a Central European “thinned out” zone, which <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had discussed with the Secretary in London, also seemed to be reflected in the communiqué.</p>
<p>Referring to the announcement that the President has invited <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> over here, I said that this had been privately proposed for the coming weekend. This was because of the President’s commitments for the middle of March. I also noted that there is just getting under way with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s visit to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2"><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> visited Paris on March 4.</note> a sort of round robin of visits. I thought there might be some advantage to having <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> come here at the beginning of that rather than at the end.</p>
<p>The Secretary indicated some unhappiness at the spectacle of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> getting into the driver’s seat and at the likelihood that if <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> does come this next week end he, the Secretary, could not take any more than a scenic part in the discussions. I told him that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> had yesterday been thinking about this first point; moreover, as to the second, the timing of the visit was not yet firm, but the boys are rushing preparations and I would not wholly exclude the possibility that there might be time to get the Secretary prepared for a participation of at least some substance. I ventured the thought that this visit might provide the opportunity to stiffen <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> if it develops that the Secretary’s fears are borne out; the Secretary wondered whether, on the contrary, he might not soften us up.</p>
<p>The Secretary speculated that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> would give in on the issue of substitution of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for Soviet personnel controlling our access to Berlin. I commented that the British could not do that without us and the French going along. The Secretary asked if the French were all right on this issue and I said as far as I know from the reports I have seen, including the report of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s contingency planning meeting on February 28,<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3">See <ref target="#d191">Document 191</ref>.</note> they are.</p>
<p>Adverting to the matter of the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, the Secretary noted that he has often said that no matter what agenda is set, anyone can bring up anything they want.</p>

<p>Though decision is reserved, the need for advance planning is evident, and the Department of State has been examining alternative possibilities. Short of general war, these appear to be two. One is the use of substantial force to attempt to reopen passage to Berlin. The other, a pacific counter-blockade, supplemented perhaps by other forms of naval reprisal, seems on preliminary examination to merit careful study also. There is attached a memorandum on this subject prepared in the State Department.</p>
<p>Pacific blockade is considered an act of reprisal rather than an act of war. By applying this concept to Berlin situation, we might frame a strategy which would counter interference with Western access not by invading East Germany, where we would be at a disadvantage, but by action at sea where the USSR would be at a disadvantage. We might, for example, control Soviet and East German shipping at the entrances to the Baltic and the Black Sea. The control could assume various degrees of stringency, in case the USSR should use gradual tactics over Berlin. It could be extended to other principal ports in the North and Far East if desired, and it could be supplemented by seizing ships on the high seas.</p>
<p>While such a course of action, like its alternative, raises serious problems, it has such apparent advantages that I believe it worth very careful study. I therefore suggest that you direct that the Department of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff report urgently on United States capabilities for naval reprisals, including counter-blockade, in connection with Berlin contingency planning.</p>

<p rend="center">BERLIN CONTINGENCY PLANNING: PACIFIC COUNTER-BLOCKADE</p>
<p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi></p>
<p>1. There are two basic issues which confront us in contingency planning for Berlin:</p>
<p>(a) at what stage and over what issue to threaten and, if necessary, use force;</p>
<p>(b) what type of force to use.</p>
<p>2. This memorandum addresses the second of these issues. It proposes in particular the study of a type of force which could be used as an alternative to substantial ground action in East Germany or immediate initiation of general war. It does not address the question of defining the point at which the proposed type of force should be used, but it does suggest that the threat to use it would decrease the likelihood of such a point being reached.</p>
<p>3. In challenging the West on Berlin, the USSR is relying on two circumstances in particular: first, the only way the West can maintain access is by crossing territory under effective communist control and, second, it is far easier to deny than to maintain such access by localized military action. It is thus clear that local use of force by Western powers cannot of itself be an effective counter to the proposed Soviet line of action, hence that its significance would consist wholly in the implied threat of imminent general war. Yet it is precisely the immense psychological gap between pinpoint Berlin situation and global reaction that has made it difficult to win Allied commitment to this step, makes Allied unanimity uncertain when faced with the ultimate decision, and therefore encourages Soviet intransigeance.</p>
<p>4. We need accordingly to look beyond Berlin to see if there is not some other way in which we can more effectively deter or counter Soviet interference with Western access. One way might be the application of seapower which served us so well over Lebanon and Quemoy. In <pb xml:id="pg_415" n="415" facs="0440"/>seapower the balance of general military advantage is with us, not with the USSR, and by its use we should be able to pick situations where the balance of local advantage would also be in our favor.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Concept of Graduated Pacific Counter-Blockade</hi></p>
<p>5. Some form of counter-blockade would seem to be the most logical use of seapower in relation to Berlin, since what is threatened against us in Berlin amounts to a blockade. It should be considered a pacific counter-blockade since it would be intended as a reprisal rather than an act of war. As Soviet or East German interference with our access might begin gradually, it would be desirable to plan wide flexibility in both degree and scope. Suitable points at which to control shipping might be at the entrances to the Baltic and the Black Sea, and the degree of control might vary with the degree of interference with our access to Berlin. The blockade could be extended to the principal ports in the north and far east if desired. It might be applied to all Soviet and East German shipping, or to vessels to and from one or more specific ports. It could also be supplemented by seizing ships on the high seas by way of reprisal, or by other measures such as a trade embargo.</p>
<p>6. If in the end any new agreements or implicit understandings were reached concerning Berlin, the continuing possibility and perhaps explicit threat of pacific counter-blockade might provide useful insurance against further Soviet bad faith or East German nibbling at our position.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Advantages as a Deterrent</hi></p>
<p>7. The USSR would know counter-blockade to be a course of action well within our capabilities, on terms relatively advantageous to us and therefore not suspect of bluffing. The recent incident when we boarded a Soviet trawler believed to have cut cables<note n="3" xml:id="d199fn3">On February 26 the U.S. Navy had boarded the Soviet trawler <hi rend="italic">Novorossisk</hi> off Newfoundland during the course of an investigation of five breaks in transoceanic cables.</note> illustrates for their benefit the decisiveness of US action in this sphere.</p>
<p>8. A strategy of counter-blockade would be a rational and symmetrical response to wrongful use of force against us, thereby appealing to the poplar sense of justice, and it would tend to place on the USSR the chief onus for extending the conflict into open hostilities if that occurred. It should therefore be more acceptable to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and to Western public opinion than using substantial force to try to open a passage to Berlin. It would be a course of action in which the French and British could fully participate, and their efforts could be supplemented by some or all other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers as a token of solidarity. Moreover it would be capable of adoption at an early date, at least for purposes of planning and preparation.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_416" n="416" facs="0441"/>
<p>To enhance its deterrent value we should probably wish to let the USSR know our intentions, privately if not publicly, well in advance. It should thus confront the USSR with the prospect of full and continuing Allied unanimity on a vital aspect of the question of using force over Berlin.</p>
<p>9. Counter-blockade would help to bridge the psychological gap between Berlin and our global deterrent. It would involve operations on an extensive scale, from which the transition to a global strike would be credible alike to friend and foe if it appeared to be in the US interest.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Advantages if Implemented</hi></p>
<p>10. In addition to several advantages already mentioned, counterblockade if implemented would inflict serious psychological and political damage on the USSR, and it could not be broken without grave risk of general war, for which the USSR would bear the main onus. It would therefore give the USSR substantial inducement to come to terms. The psychological and political inducement would be supplemented by significant economic losses, the probable amount of which should be the subject of further study.</p>
<p>11. Counter-blockade would afford time and a sound basis for further negotiations, rather than precipitating a rapid showdown. We would be under no compulsion to make concessions without counter-concessions. We would be in a relatively favorable position with world opinion, which would be drawn away from confusing details about Berlin traffic control and focussed on the big picture.</p>
<p>12. Counter-blockade would wear well in case of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intervention. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could hardly ask one side to back down more than the other, and any foot-dragging by the USSR could be matched by us.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Possible Objections</hi></p>
<p>13. While the present memorandum is only an initial not a definitive study, some objections which readily arise may be considered briefly.</p>
<p>14. Counter-blockade might be considered unduly provocative, especially since blockade is traditionally considered an act of war and the concept of pacific blockade is not familiar to the general public. But our actual interference with communist shipping would be proportionate to the interference with Western access to Berlin, hence a just response rather than a provocation. In any case in the light of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s flat statements it would probably seem less provocative than invasion of East Germany—the only alternative resort to force so far proposed.</p>
<p>15. The communists might extend the Berlin blockade to civilian traffic, or even seize West Berlin. But we would have at our disposal appropriate counter-measures, including seizing all communist shipping <pb xml:id="pg_417" n="417" facs="0442"/>and extending our counter-blockade, or deciding this meant general war. If Western troops were captured and held as hostages, we could likewise imprison all personnel of ships we seized.</p>
<p>16. West Berlin could not hold out indefinitely, and the USSR might simply sit tight until Berlin collapsed. It is true that the USSR could physically stand our counter-blockade indefinitely. But whatever the economic losses involved, the USSR would doubtless find the situation very humiliating to its prestige. Meanwhile the pressure of world opinion, both direct and through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, would mount strongly in favor of a settlement. As for Berlin, the stockpiles should enable the city to hold out physically for some months, which should be adequate. The key question would be morale, but that also should respond on the whole favorably to a vigorous stand by the West like counter-blockade. Something might also be done about morale on the other side, as the tense situation could easily bring anti-communist feelings in East Germany to the boiling point.</p>
<p>17. The USSR might well react with mine sweeping if our blockade used mines, with submarine attacks on our shipping, or plane and submarine attacks on our blockading vessels, conduct mine warfare against them, or try to force the blockade by naval escort of merchant ships. But in that event they would bear the responsibility of taking additional military measures, and we would retain the option of fighting back in a type of hostilities which would be more advantageous to us than local ground fighting and less dangerous than immediate resort to general war.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi></p>
<p>The possibility of naval reprisals, particularly in the form of pacific counter-blockade, has enough apparent promise to justify careful study.</p>

<p>3196. Bonn’s 1899 to Dept.<note n="1" xml:id="d200fn1"><ref target="#d193">Document 193</ref>.</note> We have read with much interest Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>’s stimulating and valuable observations on problems of Germany and Berlin. Embassy has following comments:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_418" n="418" facs="0443"/>
<p>1. So far as French are concerned, believe they would agree with assessment in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> to effect that retention of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is far preferable to German reunification on terms endangering Western security position. French, including <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, are not keen on German reunification in any case, and they are apprehensive of concessions to Soviets on reunification or in security field which might have adverse effect on retention of US troops on European continent (Embdesp 1553).<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2">Dated February 18. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/2–1859)</note> We believe, therefore, that French are unlikely, in four power working group, to push for dangerous compromises in our position in order to tempt Soviets to accept reunification. (Footnote: <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> officials such as <persName corresp="#p_LJ1">Laloy</persName> and Jurgensen continue be attracted by idea of “special status” for reunified Germany in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. However, it appears that this concept, which may or may not turn out to be dangerous upon further study, has not been accepted by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.) On security matters, we may find French will even oppose to troublesome extent such limited measures in security field as can be developed on our side without detriment to our position.</p>
<p>2. As caveat to above, we continue believe it is important, even if in our own minds we are prepared to accept provisional renunciation of reunified Germany, that we should not appear in our public posture, or in relationships with Germans, to give impression that we have forsaken our interest in German reunification. Nor should we ever appear to have agreed with Soviets in deal to act as “co-dividers” with them of Germany. To do so would constitute repudiation of one of major tenets our foreign policy. While this would risk damaging our reputation on world-wide basis, we would think (and here we would defer to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>’s judgment) that in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> particularly any hint on our part that we view with equanimity continued division of Germany would have most adverse repercussions. If this is true, it will be necessary for us to persist in our efforts to come forward, for public presentation, with suggestions for unified Germany which will appear “reasonable”, while at same time guarding against advocacy of ideas dangerous to our security interests.</p>
<p>3. <gloss target="#t_reftel1">Reftel</gloss> outlines frankly, and to our mind correctly, possibility that US may have to “go it alone” in order to defend Berlin by military force, including nuclear means. French attitude on this question is difficult to predict at this juncture. Although <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> and government continue solid, we have impression that French people as a whole are not very interested in Berlin question nor have yet faced up to idea that Berlin crisis may bring hostilities; much less do they seem aware that general nuclear war could result from Berlin problem. If and when <pb xml:id="pg_419" n="419" facs="0444"/>threat of nuclear war becomes acute, we are not optimistic that French, or, indeed, any of peoples in Allied countries, will be inclined to give strong support to their government in standing up to Soviets. Fear of nuclear holocaust runs deep, and recent opinion polls in Western Europe are not encouraging on this subject. However, so far as France is concerned, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s tough-minded attitude in resisting Soviet threats, plus his authority, could be decisive factor in holding France steady with us in face of threat of nuclear war over Germany. Thus, although <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>’s comments concerning deficiency of French military forces in context of Berlin crisis are undeniably true, we feel that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s position could be of key importance in preserving French support if nuclear war threatens, and in influencing other European governments in this sense.</p>
<p>4. Although <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> and Moscow in better position comment on possibility suggested <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> of making <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> headquarters in Berlin, and Soviet reaction thereto, it appears to us that while suggestion has dramatic appeal it would be unlikely to meet Soviet desire of eliminating Berlin as “cancer” harmful to Communist regime of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> headquarters in Berlin would seem only to compound difficulties for <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> regime as symbol of liberty contrasting with prison of surrounding Communist territory.</p>

<p>The President referred initially to various suggestions as to the use of the United Nations in connection with the Berlin situation. The President commented that the big problem was how to make it clear that the other side is the real aggressor, while what we wish to do is to go on with the peaceful supply of West Berlin. He said that the main purpose of this meeting was to find out how urgently planning is going on regarding what we may have to do in connection with the Berlin situation.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that, on the Three-Power contingency planning regarding the actions to be taken if access to Berlin is denied, our planning was generally along the lines discussed in the previous meeting (held on December 11, 1958).<note n="1" xml:id="d201fn1">See <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note> The British, however, think that we should not risk world war because the East Germans insist on stamping papers for Allied access. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said this issue was still in dispute, as well as the question of the possible utility of the United Nations. On the latter question, the United Nations representatives have been asked to study it and make suggestions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> tentatively thinks that the U.N. should be used before the initiation of any provocative acts.</p>
<p>The President said that he would not object to possible use of the U.N. now. However, after our access to Berlin has been stopped, if we then put the issue in the U.N., the Soviets will be able simply to sit still, and then what would we do about Berlin?</p>
<p>The President also commented that the papers he had seen about a blockade left him rather cold.<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">See the attachment to <ref target="#d199">Document 199</ref>.</note> He thought that the Soviets could stand a blockade for at least 12 months, whereas West Berlin might be choked off within 2 weeks. The President then commented that he understood that the Russians and one or two other countries recognize the East German regime. He asked what is the difference between West and East Germany as far as neutral countries are concerned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen</persName> pointed out that very few countries (one of which was Yugoslavia) recognize East Germany. The President then asked whether under international <pb xml:id="pg_421" n="421" facs="0446"/>law there was not a great difference between East and West Germany. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that the Russians already have a peace treaty with East Germany. Therefore, when the Russians now talk about signing a peace treaty with East Germany, what they are really threatening is to relinquish to the East Germans rights regarding Berlin and the corridors thereto.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> commented that the report just received from <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s remarks in Leipzig indicating that May 27 was not an absolute deadline, was not very important. The President commented that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would probably say something else tomorrow.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then raised the question of a public announcement regarding this Special Meeting and read a proposed draft statement (attached hereto).<note n="3" xml:id="d201fn3">No draft statement was attached to the source text. A copy of the release is in Department of State, PPS Files: Lot 67 D 548, Germany.</note> The President said that he had called this meeting in order to keep it to the fewest possible people. He said that if he thought it would be announced publicly, he would have wished to tell the other people who were in the regular <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Meeting. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought the public announcement might indicate over-anxiety regarding Berlin. The President remarked that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought that the public was not yet aware of the gravity of the situation. The problem was how not to get hysterical. In this connection, the President reiterated that there would be nothing worse than for us to mobilize, which would in effect constitute a victory for the Russians.</p>
<p>In answer to a question by General <persName corresp="#p_PMGWB1">Persons</persName> regarding Congressional leaders, the President noted that we now have the problem of concerting our views in preparation for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s visit. The President expressed concern that Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> may be weakening his views on the situation. The President said that since 1955 we have insisted that reunification of Germany can occur only through free elections. Until recently <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> has said that to bring up any different approach would in effect open a can of worms. However, the President understood that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> now says that we might bring up other approaches during a course of negotiations with the Soviets.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> reported that the State Department had prepared a working paper on the elements of a U.S. position regarding negotiations with the Soviets.<note n="4" xml:id="d201fn4">No copy of this paper has been found, but in a letter to <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> on March 3 <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> described it as “the first cut at a position paper which draws heavily on work and positions of the past but which is designed to give a new look to the presentation of a Western proposal.” <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> noted further that it had “no departmental, let alone governmental status” at the time. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 396.1/3–359)</note> He said that this paper was now being <pb xml:id="pg_422" n="422" facs="0447"/>coordinated with Defense, in preparation for the International Working Group meetings with our Allies which will begin next Monday.<note n="5" xml:id="d201fn5">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> The President referred to the British willingness to let East Germans stamp Allied papers. The President said that we have stood firmly behind <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> in resisting this procedure, There are indications now, however, that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> might be willing to let the East Germans stamp Allied papers and inspect loads in open vehicles. If this is so, it is difficult to say where we stand now. The President believed that the decision as to the critical point is <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> felt that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> may have taken a weaker position in the recent conversations with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName><note n="6" xml:id="d201fn6">See <ref target="#d165">Documents 165</ref>, <ref target="#d167">167</ref>, and <ref target="#d168">168</ref>.</note> in order to draw us out as to how firm we were. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was firmer in the later meetings with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
<p>The President again noted that it was very difficult to work out what constitutes the critical point in the denial of the access to Berlin, and what we would do next if that point had been reached.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is not well. He has been vacillating recently, and has defections within his own party.</p>
<p>The Vice President commented that the President’s objective has been to maintain firmness without being provocative. The Vice President noted, however, that there is a considerable segment of Congress and the Press who point up that the Administration is not going along with such steps as mobilization and, therefore, say that the President’s determination is not strong. The Vice President thought that announcing this meeting to the Press would be consistent with the President’s middle ground, and would help to counter such Congressional and Press criticism.</p>
<p>The President said that on balance he thought the announcement should be made, and requested Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> to call the people who had attended the regular <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Meeting, but not this Special Meeting, and tell them that the President would have invited them if he had known that this meeting was to be made public. The President then authorized a Press announcement consisting of the first sentence of the draft proposed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> with some modifications.</p>
<p>The Vice President then expressed the belief that a meeting with Congressional leaders would be very good. He pointed out that some Members of the Congress have shown considerable restraint regarding Berlin, and that more will if they feel that they are in on the know. The President said that he planned to meet with Congressional leaders, but <pb xml:id="pg_423" n="423" facs="0448"/>did not want to have to change his position after meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>. The Vice President thought it would be helpful to meet with Congressional leaders both before and after the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> raised the point as to whether the public had been told the magnitude of the danger. The President commented that the difficulty is we would then be accused of threatening war with Russia.</p>
<p>After considerable discussion as to possible attendance, timing and nature of a meeting with the Congressional leaders, the President decided to have a meeting with the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate and the House on the next day, March 6, 1959, at 10:30 a.m.<note n="7" xml:id="d201fn7">See <ref target="#d205">Document 205</ref>.</note></p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> then gave a report on the small military actions being taken which Soviet intelligence might pick up.<note n="8" xml:id="d201fn8">The paper outlining these actions is attached to an undated talking paper prepared for <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> in the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_WAC1">Whitman</persName> File, Miscellaneous Material.</note> General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> also reported that a Communications Plan in support of Berlin was being prepared. He also said that the Joint Chiefs felt that we can handle a garrison airlift to Berlin with only a small augmentation, even in the face of, efforts to jam our communications. The President interjected that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> says that an effort on our part to supply Berlin after an effort has been made to deny us access would be an act of war.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> then stated that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> had asked that we discontinue the reduction of Army forces in Europe, and increase those forces by about 7,000 from the U.S. Strategic Reserve. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the contemplated reduction of Army forces of Europe totalled 11,000, and that about 3,000 reduction was about to take place. The President commented that carrying out General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s recommendations would have a psychological effect only since it would not constitute a significant increase in military strength.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s proposal was OK, but that it had better be announced publicly. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> also said that this would not change the plans for the overall size of the Army. The President approved General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s recommendation, but stated that there should only be a routine announcement about it.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that as regards Air Force and Navy plans, no decisions were needed now. However, if <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> had to move large forces from southern to northern Europe, it might be necessary to supply up to 1 additional division from the United States. The President asked whether the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> plan to conduct a large scale campaign to force access to Berlin. He understood that what we planned to do was to make the other fellow stop us by force. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said we planned to keep moving until the other side shoots at us.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_424" n="424" facs="0449"/>
<p>The President said that war would be certain if we tried to make a real campaign into Berlin with, for example, 3 or 4 corps. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> remarked that this is the determination we have to make. The President thought that at that point we would then be retaliating, and that the next step would have to be against Moscow.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> questioned whether we should not now stop additional dependents going into Berlin. The President agreed that this would be desirable.</p>
<p>The Vice President noted that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> says his objective is to eliminate the simmering kettle of Berlin. The Vice President thought we should get this situation out of the context of East German recognition and into the context of saving West Berlin. The President noted that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> says we should not go to war if the East Germans want to stamp Allied cards. We say that this would not only approve the denial of Russian responsibility under treaty, but that it would constitute a recognition of the East Germans. The Vice President thought that we might have Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> indicate forcefully that this would be the end of West Berlin. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> is about halfway between <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and [<hi rend="italic">in</hi>] his opposition. The Vice President said that people cannot get excited over the recognition of East Germany, but that they will if it involves the freedom of 2 or 3 million Berliners.</p>
<p>The President thought that we should get the sentiment of the Berliners as to whether they are willing to be a free city. [2 <hi rend="italic">lines of source text not declassified</hi>] Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> thought we would have to determine whether we would go to war without our Allies.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> thought that the vacillation of our Allies suggested Congressional consultation before <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> arrives. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> thought the country was more concerned with the situation than we give it credit for.</p>
<p>Following further brief discussion regarding Congressional consultation, the President stated that he thought our military moves at this time should be seen but not talked about.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that the basic question is whether we are prepared to use all force necessary to reopen access to Berlin, even at the risk of general war.</p>
<p>The President commented that if the French and Germans are not with us he did not see how we could successfully use force in Germany to reopen access to Berlin. He did not agree with the theory that we could go it all alone with our Allies opposing us. He questioned whether we could move without support of the British, French and Germans. In fact, he thought that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> group must stand firm, or we cannot.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said it might be necessary to postpone the decision until after the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_425" n="425" facs="0450"/>
<p>The President said that the only other solution if our access to Berlin <gloss target="#t_IS1">is</gloss> stopped would be to decide if we were going to put bombs on Moscow. On the other hand, if we say we are going to withdraw from Europe, that would be doing just what the Russians want.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> suggested that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s position would be considerably dependent upon the President’s position.</p>
<p>The President thought that this was all that could be usefully discussed at this meeting, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>3216. Jansen, German Chargé, has just filled me in on <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> conversations yesterday. Jansen very obviously delighted with results visit and said that the three interviews, Colombey-LesDeux-Eglises, Bad Kreuznach,<note n="1" xml:id="d203fn1">Regarding the meeting at Colombey-Les-Deux-Eglises, September 14, see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi>, pp. 184–190 or <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Erinnerungen</hi>, pp. 436–439; regarding the meeting at Bad Kreuznach, November 26, see <ref target="#d75">Document 75</ref>.</note> and yesterday’s had become progressively more successful, warm and friendly.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_426" n="426" facs="0451"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> appears to have been at his best, gracious, wise, calm, friendly, giving his aides plenty opportunity talk and on whole, according informant, seems to have charmed <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and, very definitely, did Jansen.</p>
<p>Jansen also said <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> conducted himself extremely well throughout.</p>
<p>No reference was made to specific French or German matters and conversations were devoted entirely to “the big question,” Berlin-Germany, USSR. No decisions were taken, but this subject was explored from all angles and Jansen states that note running through conversations was <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> statement, “let us not fool ourselves, it is the Americans who count in this.” (Jansen elaborated on this that it is United States which has the power, the decision, the leadership, etc.)</p>
<p>Both <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> stressed gravity of situation, the most dangerous since end of war.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> indicated his belief that Russians were playing for big stakes and Alliance must hold firm, strong, must be no concessions; “if we accept Russian diktat Western Alliance is finished,” said <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said he hoped that Alliance would withstand and he thought it would.</p>
<p>Illustrating his own conviction that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> is a big man Jansen said <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> was unhappy about <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit to Moscow but refrained from being critical [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
<p>I asked Jansen if any specific reference was made to Algeria or question of French Mediterranean fleet; on latter subject Jansen had briefed <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> prior to meeting.</p>
<p>Jansen again said no specific French matters were dealt with—unless perhaps during private conversation of several hours which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had in afternoon at which only an interpreter was present. However Jansen does not think these matters were raised for no reference was made to them in summary of conversations which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> later gave their collaborators.</p>
<p>At dinner with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and French and German aides (<persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>, Jansen, <persName corresp="#p_BJM1">Boegner</persName>, etc.) <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> paid generous tribute to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> not only for what <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had done for Germany but for Europe and the world and concluded by expressing regret that “this small house is inadequate for such a big man.” Reference was of course to <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> of Marly where conversations took place in an atmosphere which both statesmen prefer, away from telephones, pressure and general hubbub of capital.</p>
<p>Jansen also reported <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, after having stated that he believed Western Allies would hold together against Soviets, as saying (approximately) “but even if this should not come to pass our two countries <pb xml:id="pg_427" n="427" facs="0452"/>(Germany and France) must always remain united. Together we can be salvation of Europe. Perhaps this does not seem a great deal to you now since France is not very strong, but France is beginning to come back and in time two of us can work miracles.”</p>

<p>The Secretary commented that the basic philosophy of our current program is that if we show that we are prepared to use whatever force may be required to assure our rights in respect to Berlin, and if the Soviets are in doubt of this, then we will not in the event have to use that force.</p>
<p>The Secretary also commented that if our Allies shrink from putting this philosophy into practice with us, then there is serious question of the value of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>

<p>The President opened the meeting by stating its purpose: to talk over the abnormal situation facing us in the Berlin situation and to assure that the Executive and Legislative Branches are thinking together. He did not desire the meeting to be so large as to necessitate undue publicity, and for this reason, he informed the members present that he planned to talk off the record with members of the Foreign Affairs Committees and others this evening.</p>
<p>The President reviewed briefly the policy of the U.S. Government on the Berlin issue. This policy is to warn the Soviets publicly that we will not be threatened or pushed out of Berlin and that we will not desert the 2.2 million free people in that city, but will, rather, execute our rights under existing agreements. At the same time, we will maintain an attitude of readiness to negotiate, to include discussion of a peace treaty. We do admit that other nations have interests in the Berlin crisis and we desire to explore the German situation in an atmosphere off the level of a crisis. There is no point at this time to discussing extreme measures such as mobilization. Mobilization of the entire nation’s resources would be the most disastrous thing that could come about. Our situation in the world, vis-à-vis the Soviets, should be one with which we can live for many a year. Otherwise, we must go to a garrison state. Therefore, we are being alert; we are ready to take any decent opportunity to negotiate; and we stand with our allies.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_429" n="429" facs="0454"/>
<p>The President finished his opening statement by reiterating his desire to see if the Legislative and Executive are thinking along the same lines. He emphasized that he does not desire to require anybody to sign on the dotted line, but desires to get their views.</p>
<p>At this time the President introduced Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then briefed the Members of Congress by use of a map of East Germany. This indicated Soviet and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> armed forces. (See summary of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ briefing, attached.)<note n="1" xml:id="d205fn1">Not attached to the source text. A copy of the two-page briefing, which mistakenly gives the date of the conference as March 7, is in the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_WAC1">Whitman</persName> File, DDE Diaries.</note> At the end of this presentation there were brief questions. To Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HC1">Halleck</persName>’s question regarding the reliability of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> troops, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> gave the opinion that these troops are not overly reliable, but the Soviets would not depend on them in any serious action. From this Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HC1">Halleck</persName> concluded that any action of this type would, of necessity, involve participation by the Russians. Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName>, in confirmation of this point, asked whether the Soviets are patrolling in East Germany. The answer was affirmative. In this connection, the President mentioned that the Soviets are working on their jamming capability to interfere with aircraft as well as their capability to interfere with ground access.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> questioned the distance from Berlin to Frankfurt, and clarified in his mind the fact that the city is well into the Soviet zone and that air corridors and ground accesses would be through their territory. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> confirmed that the autobahn, the railroad, and the three air corridors are being maintained as an obligation of the Russians.</p>
<p>The group then reviewed the history of this current arrangement. This was of special interest to Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName>, who mentioned that there were two agreements, in February and in July of 1945, with the President pointing out that there had been no change since those dates regarding the status of the four powers in Berlin, but that following the Berlin airlift, the 1948 agreements on access routes had been renegotiated in 1949. He confirmed that these agreements had not specified a termination date.</p>
<p>At this time the President mentioned that he has a document which sets forth the legality of our position in Berlin and he would be willing to issue this document to the Members of Congress present.<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">Presumably a reference to the memorandum cited in <ref target="#d196">Document 196</ref>.</note></p>
<p>In answer to a question by Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName>, the President clarified the relationship between the Soviets and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. If, as of May 27th, the Soviets have carried through their intention to pass their authority for control of access routes to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, this will make us obey <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> <pb xml:id="pg_430" n="430" facs="0455"/>regulations for the transit, and we will be forced to go by their sufferance. It will likewise necessitate recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as a nation. We will not accept this eventuality.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> then asked where the line will be drawn. He pointed out that Berlin is the capital of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> washes his hands of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control, Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> presumes we will protest. Here we will undoubtedly have no luck and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will then say, “Go ahead and negotiate if you can, but you still occupy the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> capital.” At this time, Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> expects the Soviets will use force. This the President clarified by calling attention to the fact that the Soviets do not threaten to force us out of Berlin. They simply state that if we use force to maintain our rights, the Soviets will back up the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> added the point that if we insist on our rights, in the Soviet view, this is an act of war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the movements necessary to the Soviets to implement their turnover would be negligible. Their troop dispositions will remain the same.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> then brought up a question of what could be done in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> between now and May 27th. To this Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out the usefulness of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as an instrument of maintaining a status quo and added that we are now exchanging notes to set up foreign ministers’ talks. If these talks do not bear fruit, then we probably will bring the matter to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The President emphasized, however, that any use of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be made while we are still exercising bur rights. In other words, prior to May 27th, we may make use of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. After May 27th it will be necessary to make direct protests to the Soviets.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> then inquired as to any new developments from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>. The President informed him that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> has accepted an invitation to arrive in Washington on March 19th after a visit to Paris and Bonn. He pointed out the difficulties in the schedule which would result from the conflict with the visit of President O’Kelly of Ireland. He also pointed out that he had requested <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to come here after seeing the others and to allocate a couple of days for discussions.</p>
<p>The briefing being completed, the President gave the floor to the Members of Congress, emphasizing the importance to the Executive to know what Congress thinks on these matters. He took note of the firm statements that had been made by Members of Congress to “delineate” our position that we will not be thrown out of Berlin. Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> pointed out quickly that Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had been emphatic on this matter.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> then inquired as to the status of the proposals for a foreign ministers’ meeting. He felt relieved on being advised that this meeting is expected to be held, stating that he would rather talk than fight. When the President pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s message had been made public, in which he announced a willingness for a foreign <pb xml:id="pg_431" n="431" facs="0456"/>ministers’ meeting,<note n="3" xml:id="d205fn3">See <ref target="#d194">Document 194</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> inquired whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had not done some changing of position. The President answered in the affirmative. On arrival of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in Moscow, a friendly joint communiqué<note n="4" xml:id="d205fn4">Not found.</note> had been issued, followed by an extremely harsh speech by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d205fn5">See <ref target="#d184fn2">footnote 2, Document 184</ref>.</note> in some area outside of Moscow. Since then, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has apparently changed his position and has shown evidence of being willing to talk. The President quoted <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s expression from his recent speech in which he said, “Don’t count your chickens before autumn.” The President gave a brief estimate of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s character in which he described him as stupid in some ways and yet exceedingly shrewd, and most certainly ruthless.</p>
<p>The President then warned the group of the danger of talk outside of this meeting, particularly with regard to the effect that loose talk would have on our negotiating position with our allies. It is extremely necessary to have the good will of such persons as General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, who occupies such a vital strategic geographical position.</p>
<p>The Vice President then pointed out one problem with regard to our acceptance of a foreign ministers’ meeting. This problem is how far do we go in insisting on our own terms for the meeting, or how far we make concessions on accepting those of the Soviets. We must not appear to want a conference at any cost. Therefore, we should avoid too much glowing public talk of a conference.</p>
<p>The President continued an estimate of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s position, pointing out that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, by his recent statements, has left himself little or no room to maneuver on the Berlin issue itself. He has gotten out of this position by broadening the context of his demands and agreeing to address the entire German problem. The President pointed out one difficulty with a foreign ministers’ meeting, which is the low status of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. In the President’s view, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is worse than Vishinsky. He is incapable of negotiating; he merely sits and glowers until he receives his orders from Moscow. There is, therefore, little hope of real negotiation with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. However, foreign ministers’ talks will have the great value of affording us time and of easing the tensions.</p>
<p>The President concluded by pointing out the vast investment we have in strengthening our relationships with Western Europe and the consequent requirement for conscientious negotiation.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> then inquired as to our courses of action in the case of the worst situation. The President admitted that this decision will not be easy and that we must see what happens. However, the case will be <pb xml:id="pg_432" n="432" facs="0457"/>negotiated to its fullest before we go to war. Fundamental in the President’s view is that we have at stake 2.2 million free Germans who trust us and upon whom we may not turn our back.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>, at the President’s request, then pointed out some of the military actions which are being taken. He emphasized that much planning is being conducted, both in the Pentagon and in General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s headquarters, on a contingency basis. He pointed out that any effort to bull our way into Berlin with ground forces alone requires more strength than we have available; therefore, no substantial reinforcement of our land forces in Europe is contemplated. For psychological reasons, however, some small reinforcements are being sent primarily to round out units and bring them up to strength. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> emphasized the improbability of moving into Germany without entailing hostilities directly with Russia. Therefore, since we cannot fight this battle on the ground, we are studying the matter of airlift as a fallback action. We are preparing our crews by way of familiarizing them with Tempelhof airfield and we are making electronic jamming studies. The Secretary emphasized that what we are making are normal preparations. He feels that the Congressmen present should know about them, but he requests that talk be avoided to enable us to bring our allies along with us. We are playing on the basis of “not much noise but carry a big stick.” We must realize that the Russians will carry their threats “up to the line.” We are therefore planning as if we will be required to carry out our contingency plans. We think, however, the country will be better served if we avoid saber rattling. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> agreed in the light of coordination difficulties that we must not talk unilaterally.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> then expressed the view that this is an extremely important meeting from a coordination viewpoint. He admits the infeasibility of fighting this enemy on the ground, but stated that he is interested in knowing what other alternatives are available. He questioned the adequacy of our forces. While admitting that he would not desire to get into details, he requested the President’s views. Looking at it from his own standpoint, Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> reiterated that his big desire is to be able to help. Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> went on to point out some of the difficulties he has in answering questions from constituents. As an example, he mentioned his difficulties in answering questions from constituents on the timing of a final decision on the future status of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> then returned to his question of alternatives to ground action. He asked how Members of Congress can aid the Executive, and whether the forces are adequate. He pointed out the seeming inconsistency of the current force reductions with the crisis atmosphere prevailing with regard to Berlin. To this the President answered that we are placing much money in our defense forces and retaliatory power. He <pb xml:id="pg_433" n="433" facs="0458"/>emphasized that it is impossible for the United States to maintain manpower in service comparable to that of the Soviets, in the light of our own wage scale. He pointed out the possibility, therefore, that when we reach the acute crisis period, it will be necessary to engage in general war to protect our rights. He cited examples in the past of Communist tactics in which they have maintained a strong bluff to the last moment and then backed out. These examples included threats of general war with regard to Korea, Viet-Nam, Lebanon and the Taiwan Straits. In the President’s view, the question is whether we have the nerve to push our chips into the pot. He is convinced that any appeasement means disaster. Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> hastily added that the Congress agrees that we shall have no appeasement.</p>
<p>The President admitted the possibility that this firm position could conceivably bring about a miscalculation and therefore general war; however, this is only a possibility. In the event we adopt a policy of appeasement, the President is absolutely certain that we are defeated. On the other hand, this does not mean that we will not negotiate. We will negotiate whenever we can and are making many efforts in that direction. All heartily agreed with this point.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HC1">Halleck</persName> then brought up the question of possible measures to condition the people of America to the eventuality that the “balloon may go up.” To this the President asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HC1">Halleck</persName> was referring to a campaign to scare the population. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HC1">Halleck</persName> continued by defining his question in terms of how to precipitate hostilities in the event the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> stopped a convoy. He admits that things would be simpler if the enemy would fire the first shot; but his question is how to make the enemy fire the first shot on the ground. He pointed out the great possibilities of nonviolent obstruction, and in this connection, the merits of the air corridors. The President answered this question by pointing out that a crisis will be precipitated only in the event the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> closes off the corridors. Many studies are being currently conducted as to how to precipitate this crisis in the event of the close-off. These studies include such matters as breaking off of diplomatic relations and cessation of trade.</p>
<p>The President, as a footnote to history, then gave a recast of his initial views with regard to occupation of Berlin when he was a military commander in 1945. He finds it somewhat ironic that he is now confronted with a crisis based on a decision against which he had recommended as a military commander.</p>
<p>The President went on to emphasize that studies are also being conducted on the means of applying counterpressures. He reiterated his conviction that if we stand firm on this issue and make our firmness obvious to the Soviets and the world, the Soviets will back down. Here <pb xml:id="pg_434" n="434" facs="0459"/>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> interjected that the alternative is to “push the button.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> agreed that there is no other way.</p>
<p>The Vice President stated the necessity of being firm, while avoiding such provocative measures (which have been suggested) as placing forces on alert or mobilizing. These actions present the problem of provoking and frightening our allies. He continued that the position of the United States government is by far the strongest in the free world, when we consider the backing which the Executive is receiving. Other free governments are in a difficult position because of the fears of the population, due to their proximity to the difficulty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> reiterated that once we make noise we may militate against allied support.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> pointed out that two or three Senators have been waving resolutions to express the “consensus of the Senate.” He pointed out his objection to this type of action and expressed the view that this type of meeting represents a middle-of-the-road approach, and, therefore, derives great importance, primarily because it illustrates that we are not split along party lines. The President emphasized that he does not at this time desire a resolution in the Senate. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> called attention to the fact that the proponents point to the efficacy of the Taiwan Straits resolution, the President stated that this is a different type of matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> stated that it will be easy to hold the House in control on this matter, but not the Senate. (Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s volunteered statement that Senator Javits has proposed a resolution for a seven-man committee to tell our story to the Berliners brought an unpleasant reaction from the President.) They all reviewed again the importance of this meeting as a middle ground.</p>
<p>The President then stated his position as an advocate of peace and peace by negotiation. He repeated the necessity of being firm but not rigid when faced by an aggressor. We will not be served by ultimatum, since the ultimatum does not constitute negotiation—but we will not be truculent. Again Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> posed a question as to the adequacy of our forces in the event negotiations break down, and the President again said that he could see no material needs which we do not already possess.</p>
<p>The President then continued by describing his satisfaction with our military instrument. He stated that we do in fact suffer under a problem of an excess of power. If we dump our entire programmed loads, comprising many, many megatons, on Russia, there is some question as to what will happen. He called attention to the current concern over levels of strontium 90 resulting from only a few weapons being fired in tests. To Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s repeated question as to whether the Congress is doing all they ought to give the Executive all it needs, the President answered in the affirmative. The Senator then mentioned that he would like to see the Joint Chiefs of Staff be likewise firm in their <pb xml:id="pg_435" n="435" facs="0460"/>support of this program when they testify, if they do in fact agree. The President pointed out that in the event of acute crisis, some forces might be called up if the Executive is warned some two or three days before the D-day of a general war. Under existing law, he could call up Reservists and National Guardsmen to supplement the police forces, largely to maintain order in the United States. He pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> does not desire war [any] more than we. He cited his own experience in war that the enemy is always as frightened as we are.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> then posed the question as to whether we are telling the public all we should. To this Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> answered immediately in the affirmative. In his view our people cannot understand the implications of this situation, and excessive warning on our part would cause undue alarm, not only to our own people, but to the Russians as well.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> then mentioned that this particular crisis may not be the primary objective of the Soviets. In his view we may find that their true objective is a coup in Iran and that the Berlin crisis is only a diversion. This view appeared to be accepted by all.</p>
<p>The Vice President once more mentioned the great significance of this meeting, and the President suggested that a picture be taken. This was received most enthusiastically.</p>
<p>The Vice President then went on to voice his concern with talk that we are bluffing. He recommends that the leaders reinforce the view that the United States has sufficient strength to deal with this situation. He recommends that such words as “prepared for any eventuality” be used.</p>
<p>The group then paused to pay tribute to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> in his design nation as the “most experienced” man in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The tack to be taken by Members as they speak to the press was then discussed. Various approaches were offered and the subject reverted to the value of this meeting to all present. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HC1">Halleck</persName> pointed out that he had learned much that is highly useful to him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> expressed the same view, and pointed out that some of his constituents had complained that he was not being kept sufficiently informed. To this the President quickly answered. He accepted the possibility that he may sometimes incorrectly assume that everybody has been informed. He assured all present that if any of them ever develop the feeling that they are being left out, they should call him immediately and they would then be invited to come over and discuss the issues at stake. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> entered at this point.)</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> tended to stress the idea that planning and forces are adequate to meet any eventuality, whereas Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> tended to stress the idea that we will spare no efforts to solve this matter by <pb xml:id="pg_436" n="436" facs="0461"/>negotiation. In this connection, the Vice President pointed out that the Communists will attempt to becloud the issue of the Berlin accesses by emphasizing details. This they will attempt to do by making each additional restriction seem so minute as not to be worth our taking a stand. In all our statements we should point out that what is truly at stake is not detailed procedures, but the freedom of 2.2 million free people. To this the President added that our capability of sustaining the free world is also at stake.</p>
<p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> inserted an opinion regarding the importance of Berlin in the overall world picture. In his view Western Europe is strengthening. The Soviets would not feel safe in turning elsewhere in the world to points such as Iran while we are in Berlin and Europe remains strong. This brought a question from Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> as to whether the allies are as strong in their determination as are we. The President answered that they are not, but stated that their progress is heartening. He pointed up the British Labor Party as representing a particularly weak element. Some of the recent proposals of Hugh Gaitskell could be comparable to those of Chamberlain at Munich. The President added, as assurance to Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, that matters of international consequence of this type have not been discussed in GOP leaders meetings. Matters of international implication have been reserved to bipartisan meetings.</p>
<p>This brought on a question from the Vice President regarding informing other Members of Congress. This question he addressed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName>, requesting guidance on what procedures should be followed. Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> expressed satisfaction with the meetings being held with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, and stated that such is very helpful. He further expressed satisfaction at the President’s statement that we are capable of handling any contingency. He feels that it is most important that the Joint Chiefs of Staff back up this point of view when they testify. There are some people in the Pentagon who feed information through the back door to the legislators. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> agreed. The President remarked that the munitions makers have this habit as well as people from the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> then reviewed his recommendations as to what points should be emphasized publicly. They are:</p>
<list>
<item>1. That we have explored the situation and we will maintain our rights and responsibilities to the people of Berlin.</item>
<item>2. That we have agreed to stand firm but are willing to negotiate.</item>
<item>3. The stand we should take on our actual military capabilities.</item>
<item>The President thinks that this third point should be answered by stating that our capabilities are adequate for our particular position in the world.</item>
</list>
<p>We have maintained this position for some ten or eleven years and it is going well. Of course we cannot fight a 60- or 90-division war. We <pb xml:id="pg_437" n="437" facs="0462"/>should emphasize that we are looking for peaceful solutions with honor and stress that we will not walk away from honor. He feels that the Members of Congress should not answer questions. This Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> said is impossible. The newspaper reporters will follow the Members of Congress and dog their steps. It was therefore agreed that: (1) a picture would be taken, (2) no statement would be made by the President, and (3) the Members of Congress would meet the press in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName>’s office immediately following the meeting and each would make a statement.</p>

<p>The Secretary telephoned from Walter Reed. Said he was feeling better than he had a little while ago; that he had just had a blood transfusion; that he has been feeling very weak; that the injections have all been pretty powerful, that he has lost a lot of weight quickly and has felt weak.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> said he understood the President may be coming out this afternoon and CAH said he knew the President hoped to come out around 4:00.<note n="1" xml:id="d206fn1">No record of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> during the former’s visit to Walter Reed Hospital from 3:59 to 4:32 p.m. has been found.</note> <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> asked what developed this morning. CAH said the meeting this morning lasted an hour and a half;<note n="2" xml:id="d206fn2">See <ref target="#d205">Document 205</ref>.</note> there was a good deal of probing of what we do under certain contingencies. CAH said the President convinced them of the fact that we cannot fight a ground battle around Berlin with the Germans and the Russians—that is out. President said if Soviets take it by force we have to then face up to the big decision but in the meanwhile we would do everything feasible to negotiate. CAH said it ended up on a very cheerful note; they went out and saw the press and took the line that it was an interesting session and that they are in complete agreement we would remain firm while continuing all fruitful negotiations. CAH said they were trying to get down to brass tacks and CAH said he thought it was good to convince them we will not fight a ground battle.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_438" n="438" facs="0463"/>
<p>JFD said that is what he said to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>; JFD told <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> it has to be a war we can win, not one we are bound to lose.</p>
<p>CAH said <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> kept trying to get President to make a categoric statement that we had enough strength if it came to war—obviously this was due in part to the political arguments on budget versus defense preparedness—and CAH said he thinks the President gave the feeling we are taking all preparations necessary; consulting with our allies in the free world; and confidence that if we had to meet this situation we could. CAH said it was interesting that on the Senate side both <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DEM1">Dirksen</persName> were strong in coming up to the final decision and making it in favor of war. On the House side, both <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rayburn</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HC1">Halleck</persName> said we had to keep saying we would continue negotiations to settle this. CAH said there is another session this afternoon. JFD asked with who, and CAH said the President was meeting with <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> and ranking members in Senate and House of Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees. JFD expressed some surprise and CAH said we were under tremendous pressures from the Hill. In that connection, CAH said <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> announced in the paper this morning he was calling CAH up to testify next Tuesday before the Foreign Relations Committee and CAH said he thought this was extremely bad. CAH said both he and President hope to discuss this with <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> this afternoon. CAH said this is not the way to conduct this business at the moment; that even if hearing is in Executive Session, there will most likely be leaks.</p>
<p>JFD said it must be realized that if the Soviets by threatening to do things by force do destroy our rights and force us to retreat and make concessions, it is just the beginning. JFD said if we are perfectly firm in our position he is personally convinced that there is not one chance in 1000 the Soviets will push it to the point of war.</p>
<p>CAH said he didn’t like the British line in <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>’s message.<note n="3" xml:id="d206fn3">On March 5 <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> sent <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> a letter that outlined a message from <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>. The Foreign Secretary believed that the reply to the Soviet note of March 2 should not be rushed; that it could be drafted following <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s visits to Paris, Bonn, and Washington; and that it could be delivered after the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting in April. (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_WAC1">Whitman</persName> File, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> Series)</note> CAH said he showed it to the President and showed him draft reply to Soviet note prepared by <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d206fn4">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> CAH said he recommended to President we go ahead and shoot the draft to our allies instead of waiting until <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> comes here. JFD said <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> is trying to get all the domestic political mileage he can get and JFD said we are not unsympathetic to this since we don’t want to see Bevan win the election, and JFD said within reason there is no objection to giving him an important role as far as the appearance of things is concerned but to JFD’s <pb xml:id="pg_439" n="439" facs="0464"/>mind this whole thing is very vital from the standpoint of our whole <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> posture and position. JFD said there is no point in having troops there—which are expensive to maintain—if those troops won’t be used if need be.</p>
<p>CAH said the President made clear yesterday at <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> that regarding overflights, communications, etc., we can’t go along by ourselves. We would have to pull out of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. [7–1/2 <hi rend="italic">lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p>CAH said on the Camp David idea, he was certain the President and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> would not do this unless JFD could go there. CAH said the President felt the facilities there were more comfortable for JFD and he could be taken care of better and be able to rest as JFD felt need of it rather than have JFD travelling back and forth to the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House. CAH reiterated he was certain President and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> would abandon this idea if it were not feasible from JFD’s standpoint. JFD said it is a very awkward situation. JFD said he didn’t want to hold on to the title if he couldn’t do the job. CAH said the <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> should hot worry about this; that all anybody wanted was for JFD to get back into harness. JFD said the doctor told him today there would probably be two weeks more of the X-ray, and said that is a very weakening process and that it will still be going on during the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit, but JFD said treatment can be interrupted without serious impairment. JFD said he is really worried that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> is going to be prepared to compromise on recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, etc., which would be a gain for the Soviet Union. JFD said he doesn’t think they are entitled to get any net gain. Said what is wrong with the Berlin situation? Said we nearly had a war ten years ago and we reached a compromise; the only trouble is it has been going too good from the Communists’ standpoint. JFD said this is just so much talk about competition between their system and ours; that when they are competing nearby, they can’t stand the comparison. JFD said that is the only reason in the world for raising this problem. Said West Berlin doesn’t want a change; they don’t mind being occupied; their productivity, population, etc is increasing and conditions are good. JFD said what is all the reason for this excitement? <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> then said jokingly that CAH could see he had just had a blood transfusion.</p>
<p>JFD said he would like to see CAH over the weekend and CAH said he would be available whenever the <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> wanted him.</p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Cabot Lodge</persName> came to see me this afternoon with a message from the President. He had just talked to the President about the possible role of the United Nations in the Berlin crisis, and had suggested that, if a Summit meeting was desirable or perhaps inevitable in that connection, the Security Council of the United Nations, with the heads of governments present, should be the forum for such a meeting.<note n="1" xml:id="d207fn1"><persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> met with the President from 12:15 to 12:30 p.m. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., President’s Daily Appointments Book)</note></p>
<p>The President liked the idea and suggested that perhaps some reference to this idea might be incorporated in our draft reply to the Soviet note of March 2nd.</p>
<p>I told <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Cabot</persName> I was somewhat doubtful as to the wisdom of this since it seemed to me it would merely complicate the simple suggestion which our draft reply contained. I also told him it was my own view that the United Nations should be held in reserve for two contingencies:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) If, by an exchange of notes with the Soviet Government it appeared clear that no negotiations could be agreed upon before May 27th, then it would be desirable to have a United Nations Resolution urging the maintenance of the status quo and the initiation of negotiations.</item>
<item>(2) If negotiations should begin, and during the course of them the Soviet Government concluded a peace treaty with the East German Government and turned over to the latter all responsibility for the right of access to East Berlin, then a Security Council meeting with the heads of government present might head off precipitate action.</item>
</list>
<p>He told me he agreed in general with these two thoughts and that he would proceed at once to consulting with his British and French colleagues in accordance with the decision reached at the tripartite talks on Saturday last. Apparently <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> felt he had had no specific instructions on this matter, and so the conversations had not been begun.</p>

<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> expressed concern that the meeting with the President on Thursday, March 5, had not cleared up certain aspects of Berlin contingency planning.<note n="1" xml:id="d208fn1">At 8:30 a.m. on March 9 <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> had discussed the Special <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Meeting held on March 5 (see <ref target="#d201">Document 201</ref>) with the President. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> noted that that meeting “had not been too successful” and had accomplished less than he desired. He also stated that <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> had called him following the meeting to voice his dissatisfaction as well. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> suggested that a small group be set up to “mature” the problem in preparation for another meeting with the President, and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> approved the procedure since he admitted “that he was still confused as to what we would do under certain contingencies.” (Memorandum of discussion with the President, March 11; <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, Project Clean Up)</note> He said that present military planning does not go beyond possible blockage of a Western probe after turnover. Should the Department of Defense be thinking of a garrison air lift while the case was in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The advantage of resorting to the air would be that the communists would have to shoot first if they wanted to stop this form of access. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> expressed concern that the “turn-over” might occur in a matter of a few weeks.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> asked how “stiff-necked” we were regarding document examination. He felt that it would be hard to sell America on general war merely to avoid East German stamping of our documents—<pb xml:id="pg_442" n="442" facs="0467"/>unless it was clear that stamping amounted to US recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It was pointed out that the UK position seems to be one of agreement that we should submit to no East German inspection or control, but the UK apparently does not want to resort to force over the matter of East German stamping of documents. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> pointed out that the West Germans accept East German stamping in connection with civilian traffic.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> supported Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>’s thesis that “stamping” was not a good point at which to resort to force. He felt that the West Germans were “leading us into a mouse trap”.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had felt strongly that we should not submit to stamping. This was not just a legal matter, but had significant political overtones. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that under European practice acceptance of stamping connoted acceptance of the stamper’s right of inspection. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> suggested that this matter be left, indicating that he thought we could reach agreement.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> then said that, assuming a blockage had occurred, should the military be planning to fly a substantial number of planes into Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that there would be no need for this in view of the adequate garrison supplies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> felt that we should go to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> before instituting an air lift. If supplies had to be flown in, the flights should not be designated as an “air lift”.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> asked if we should plan to mobilize as soon as our ground access was blocked. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> thought that we should not, but that a number of preparatory measures should be taken. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> indicated that this is what he had meant by the term “mobilization”.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out that after a blockage, it was likely that commercial flying into Berlin would cease and military planes would probably have to take up this load.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that presumably a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> meeting at this time would be the background for a “Summit” meeting. He added that a first indicator of Soviet movement would be the signing of a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> then read off a list of preparatory moves the military thought should be made.<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">Although this list has not been identified with certainty, presumably it is the one referred to in <ref target="#d201fn8">footnote 8, Document 201</ref>.</note> The Chiefs would like to start such moves right away, but the President has reservations about the public impact.</p>
<p>There was general discussion about the desirability of beefing up the 7th Army in Germany and the effect which such an action would <pb xml:id="pg_443" n="443" facs="0468"/>have on the adequacy of our central reserve in the US to deal with possible crises in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought that the Soviets were not concerned about a possible ground force move by the West. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> disagreed, pointing out that the great mistake, in his judgment, of the 1948–49 blockade episode was our failure to move on the ground.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> expressed the opinion that, if we continue on a “business as usual” basis, the Soviets may miscalculate our intentions. He also felt that our allies would tend to become timid and look at this problem in a black and white fashion—either give up Berlin or go to total nuclear war.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> questioned the wisdom of beefing up the 7th Army at the same time that we were going ahead with the 30,000 place reduction in our over-all armed forces.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> suggested that another meeting with the President should be held since he felt that the President was not sufficiently current on contingency planning.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> read parts of the “Agenda for Discussion of Berlin” which was prepared for this meeting (copy attached).<note n="3" xml:id="d208fn3">Not printed. Drafted by <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Morgan</persName> on March 9, this agenda listed minimum requirements, the “cut-off” point, countermeasures, preparatory measures, negotiating posture, and Allied solidarity as items for discussion.</note></p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> expressed concern about our public posture in this matter. He felt that we should say to the Russians, in effect, that we are glad they propose to give up their occupancy of East Berlin, and that we should avoid any implication that we wanted them to stay on. He wondered if we should not go further and replace Soviet inspectors with our own people when the turn-over occurred.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> expressed the opinion that a firm US position would be more effective now and for the next few months than in the fall or next year.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> expressed the opinion that we had not yet made clear what it was we wanted the Soviets to do. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said we wanted “free access” to Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> expressed the opinion that firm American popular support for our Berlin position was based on a belief that the Soviets themselves plan to blockade Berlin. He felt that, when it became clear that the Soviet threat was much more ambiguous, there was danger of confusion in American understanding. Therefore, we should make very clear what it was we wanted the Soviets to do and what we wanted them not to do.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> pointed out that a speech was being prepared for the President on the subject of the adequacy of our military establishment <pb xml:id="pg_444" n="444" facs="0469"/>and, perhaps, reference in this speech could be made to our Berlin thinking.</p>
<p>There was further discussion about the possibility of deploying an additional division from <gloss target="#t_STRAC1">STRAC</gloss> to replace a division which General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> may have to deploy to the north and to the east in connection with the Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>The discussion was concluded with an agreement that the Chiefs and the Department of Defense would prepare a list of military moves which they thought should be made, and State would prepare a list of political moves. These two lists would be meshed and would be presented to the President probably after next Thursday’s <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting.</p>

<p>694. Paris for <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName>. During recent weeks some corrosion West Berlin in morale imperceptible in detail is beginning be discernible in cumulative effect (Berlin’s despatches 620 and 621).<note n="1" xml:id="d209fn1">Both dated March 2. The former transmitted a report on the attitudes and morale of Berlin workers, and the latter transmitted a report on the attitudes and opinions of Berlin’s political leaders on the situation in Berlin. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/3–259)</note> Apprehension re outcome Berlin crisis has increasingly pervaded thinking of politically articulate segments of population.</p>
<p>This concern engendered by: 1) <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>’s show of self-assurance and aggressiveness compounded by unwillingness yield on any aspect their substantive demands while making only apparent concessions re procedural matters; 2) inclination some elements in West detect favorable omens in these “concessions”; 3) apparent lack Allied unity in dealing with <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> moves and inability (as reported in press) after three months’ consultation arrive at plan of action; 4) worry that even some key Western policy and opinion makers may fail recognize deadly seriousness <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> challenge and may fail prepare materially and psychologically for real showdown with <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s over what might seem to Western publics to <pb xml:id="pg_445" n="445" facs="0470"/>be minor “<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control” issue; 5) fear if <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s go to brink West might unwittingly make what appear be minor concessions with major implications placing city’s freedom in serious jeopardy; 6) press reports re 2, 3, 4, especially speculative articles by columnists, which have greatly contributed to feeling uneasiness and have diminished beneficial effects recent reaffirmations Berlin guaranty; 7) Secretary’s illness at crucial time in East-West relations.</p>
<p>Berlin leaders feel present impasse unlikely be solved by further statements. They convinced more physical evidence Western determination, such as build-up general military strength, may be required dissuade <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s from carrying out their threats to take unilateral action. There no question in their minds such moves would meet with full approval Berlin population as sign of Western resolve (see Berlin’s airgram G–324 to <gloss target="#t_SecState1">SecState</gloss>, G–145 Bonn).<note n="2" xml:id="d209fn2">Airgram G–324, March 4, transmitted a report on a meeting at the Berlin Press Club on March 2 at which the Commandants exchanged views with leading Berlin press editors. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.0221/3–459)</note></p>
<p>Basically Berlin’s leading elements remain admirably calm and brave despite inner concern and continue put faith in belief that, if their protectors stand firm, Soviets will ultimately not drive matter to armed conflict. Berliners naturally also hope that if there must be concessions they will be ones for which full price is paid by Soviets; that is, real compromises not Western surrenders.</p>
<p>Although responsible Berliners are usually careful not to criticize unfavorably British and French we have general impression that they consider France willing but weak because of Algerian situation, Britain momentarily irresolute though basically probably dependable, and look to <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> to provide both initial strength and leadership necessary to put full resources free world in line against Soviet menace to its most exposed citizens.</p>
<p>Insofar as we can detect mass Berlin population not as apprehensive as politically informed elements. There are only scattered outward signs of disquiet. Berliners generally have adopted attitude watchful concern, closely scrutinizing all developments relating Berlin situation. Party leaders report questions asked at Party meetings indicate extraordinary awareness international situation. Outward calmness of population evidenced by absence increased buying or hoarding of nonperishables. Berlin leaders wish housewives would fill their larders in order make room in city’s warehouses for further public stockpiling but don’t quite know how to suggest such private stockpiling without causing panic.</p>

<p>741. For <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>. Re Berlin, <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 735.<note n="1" xml:id="d210fn1">Telegram 735, March 9, transmitted preliminary guidance for <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> in discussing recourse to the United Nations with the British and French representatives. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/3–959)</note> Following are Department’s suggestions re problems to be explored with British and French representatives in your preliminary discussions re <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in Berlin situation:</p>
<p>(1) In event direct negotiations cannot be arranged or collapse, we believe there would be certain definite advantages in Western initiative in bringing Berlin matter to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. We recognize very strong pressures will develop for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action and also recognize usefulness <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mobilizing world opinion. We also recognize certain disadvantages <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action, particularly risk <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> involvement in substance German problem. However, assuming desirability or necessity resort to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> at some stage, we believe US in better position to resist unsatisfactory substantive proposals and to attain positive benefits from <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action, if step can be taken prior to any Soviet action affecting status quo. Unless we move first, prospect is that others will bring matter to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, or if circumstances appear desperate, may even seek special <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> session. In general, Department favorably impressed by arguments your 716 and 729<note n="2" xml:id="d210fn2">Telegram 716, February 26, noted the merits of transferring the Berlin question to the Security Council before the Soviet Union handed over its responsibilities to the East Germans since the United Nations tended to favor the side maintaining the status quo. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/2–2659) Telegram 729, March 3, reiterated this view after receiving the tripartite contingency plan. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/3–359)</note> for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> initiative prior to Soviet transfer calling upon governments and authorities concerned not to take any unilateral action interfering with access to Berlin and renewing offer to negotiate. This line of action automatically identifies USSR as party responsible for any subsequent change in situation that could upset delicate balance of peace.</p>
<p>(2) Contingency paper proposes that if initial probe physically obstructed, three Powers will temporarily suspend surface traffic and seek to mobilize opinion by variety means, in which case situation “could be taken” to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and in event of Soviet veto, to special <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. While we believe action to be sought would at least include elements in para 1 above, which would mean in contingency context call for restoration of freedom <pb xml:id="pg_447" n="447" facs="0472"/>of access and for resumption of negotiations, we recognize that if USSR takes negative attitude in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, we may not be able press such proposal. We fully agree with your view that since under these circumstances change in status quo will already have occurred, we may be compelled consider other alternatives. We might be confronted with efforts to compromise basic principles in way that would tend obscure true issues and even equate Soviet and Western positions by seeking modus vivendi accepting Soviet transfer. If we go to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, particularly at this late stage, we must be prepared deal with proposals on substance, as well as procedure. We must also take into account that our resort to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> in crisis might tend inhibit or delay Western Powers in taking direct action to assert rights or otherwise respond directly to unilateral Soviet action.</p>
<p>(3) We would be interested in having current British and French thinking re relative merits timing proposed by contingency paper and timing suggested your 716, as elaborated in para 1 above.</p>
<p>(4) In event Western Powers should at some stage decide accept Summit meeting, subject of course to conditions then prevailing, we would appreciate views UK and French whether we should make proposal similar to that of last summer for high level <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting or at least respond positively to proposals of this character made by others in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. At this time, it is clearly premature to seek to reach any decisions this point since much will depend on evolution our discussions with USSR. We recognize <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> framework has certain obvious drawbacks from Soviet standpoint and would be interested in having any comments from you as to steps that might be taken make <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> framework more acceptable to USSR. In this connection we recall Soviet efforts last summer to bring Nehru into picture.</p>
<p>(5) In addition to foregoing, you should also explore desirability and feasibility special <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> action in event <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> impasse. It is clearly impossible now to reach any conclusions regarding special <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> since immediate circumstances then prevailing will be determining. However, we believe important to consider now pros and cons re special <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> in event <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> stalemate. This would also involve consideration of means to avert special <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> if judged not in our interest. Our estimate is that <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> would be considerably more difficult to control than <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. To some extent we would wish to adjust our objectives in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to our estimate desirability and feasibility, or reverse, of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> action. For example your suggestion that under certain circumstances it might be desirable not to press proposal in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to veto might provide one way of confining action to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Would appreciate your views and those of UK and French Missions this point.</p>
<p>(6) It would be useful to have joint estimate of probable Soviet position and tactics in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and best means of countering them. We must <pb xml:id="pg_448" n="448" facs="0473"/>expect USSR to seek to define basic issues in terms most favorable to its own position, such as Soviet right relinquish occupation and Soviet right terminate state of war with Germany or Soviet initiative for summit meeting. We should be fully prepared meet such Soviet contentions in manner calculated win support of world opinion. This will require most careful study since certain Soviet arguments may have considerable superficial attractiveness.</p>
<p>(7) Department also suggests exploration advantages and disadvantages Western initiative (as opposed to initiative by others) in convening <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> in above circumstances. Our ability maintain maximum control and exercise greatest influence can best be assured by our keeping initiative so we are not placed generally on defensive. However, Dept wishes you consider whether there may be advantage in leaving initiative elsewhere. For example, there seems possibility Western initiative to involve <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might be interpreted by USSR as indication Western weakness or hesitation assume risks of direct action to preserve rights. Under certain circumstances, this might inspire dangerous miscalculation.</p>
<p>(8) It would also be useful obtain current British and French thinking, plus further ideas of <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, regarding any other problems you may foresee.</p>
<p>(9) Department wishes emphasize importance conducting above exploratory discussion in manner which will minimize outside speculation re <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in Berlin situation.</p>

<head>211. Testimony by the Chief of Staff of the Army (Taylor) Before the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Armed Services<note n="0" xml:id="d211fn0" type="source">Source: <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, Harlow Records. Top Secret. General Taylor testified at morning and afternoon sessions on March 11.</note></head>
<dateline><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1959-03-11">March 11, 1959.</date></dateline>
<p>[Here follow introductory remarks.]</p>
<p>General Taylor. The Berlin situation has, of course, been with us since Potsdam. It reached the critical point at the time of the Berlin Airlift, and recurrently since that time has been in mind as the allies, the United States, Britain and France have repeatedly been exposed to pressures placed upon their communications with the city of Berlin.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of commanding there two years immediately after the airlift, and have a very deep feeling of the importance of Berlin and the significance of the problem represented thereby. I cannot say that the events which have taken place in recent months have been a surprise to me. Even in ‘49 and ‘50 when I was in command we were predicting that next time pressure was applied upon the city of Berlin to any serious degree, that it would be done not by the USSR but by the East German Republic.</p>
<p>In other words, if we had another blockade that it would be done without a Russian in sight. So that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s announcement late in the fall, in November, was perhaps surprising only as it came rather late, later than I would have predicted say five or six years ago. Since that time, of course, we have intensified our attention to the problem and found that the factors really haven’t changed over the years. We still have the problem of maintaining communications, of maintaining the freedom of 2 and a half million West Berliners for whom we are responsible and for whose life, safety and fortunes we have pledged our honor. From the military point of view that problem is virtually insolvable if it is the intention of the USSR and its allies to use force against the allies in Berlin.</p>
<p>That is it is impossible as a single isolated solution.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. Would you repeat that statement now?</p>
<p>General Taylor. Putting it in slightly different words, Berlin has always been untenable as a military position. In other words, it is over 100 miles inside the Iron Curtain. It is an island surrounded on all sides by superior forces. A surprise attack or an imminent attack with warning could never be resisted locally by military means. We have known that, we have accepted the fact. It is inevitable. On the other hand, we have <pb xml:id="pg_450" n="450" facs="0475"/>thus far protected Berlin first by the evident resolution that we would not accept interference with our rights without making a very violent reaction.</p>
<p>We so reacted at the time of the airlift. I think that you will find that many of the leaders of the airlift, people like General <persName corresp="#p_CGLD1">Clay</persName>, General Hayes and others felt at the time that we should never have accepted the airlift, but rather should have used force on the highway, at least to verify what the Russian intent was.</p>
<p>Instead we accepted a challenge which may well have been a bluff. We will never know to what extent the USSR would have gone to maintain the blockade by force. We have foreseen that if the <gloss target="#t_EGR1">EGR</gloss>, the Eastern German Republic replaced the USSR and by similar measures undertook to blockade Berlin that our problem would be greater in the sense that the affront and the loss of honor to accept the will of the conquered East Germans over the U.S. and its allies would be much greater, much more serious in international relations.</p>
<p>Hence when this challenge did come last November, as I say we knew very intensely our contemplation of all facets of the old problem and found that they really had not changed very much.</p>
<p>In military language, and I say in military language with diffidence because this is essentially a political problem, as I view the military side of the operation or the possible operation, they are directed more at strengthening our political power, at supplementing our position at the negotiation table rather than as a straightforward military planning which is much simpler than this complicated picture that we face.</p>
<p>But again as I started to say, in military terms what are we faced with? We are faced possibly with the use of limited force or indeterminate force on the part of the East Germans after May 27th to prevent our free access to Berlin.</p>
<p>That will mean that we will have to decide well in advance how to cope with that kind of situation. In my judgment it should call first for I would call it a reconnaissance of intention. This time we should never allow bluff to force us into a self-imposed blockade or anything resembling that kind of passive reaction.</p>
<p>I would say that we should certainly probe at once to find out will any force be used to prevent our free access on the ground to Berlin? And if that is the case, then to apply repeated force and in such strength as the situation may require to develop that in deed. This is a major effort to which the <gloss target="#t_EGR1">EGR</gloss> and the Soviet Union are willing to engage in formal military operations and by that time we will reach the point of extremely serious decision, how far then will we go?</p>
<p>Will we indeed pass to general war? But I would sum up the formula which in my mind is clear as crystal, that we must be willing now <pb xml:id="pg_451" n="451" facs="0476"/>to make up our respective minds now that we will use all force necessary to secure the lives and safety of these two and a half million Germans to whom we are committed unalterably in language that cannot be compromised.</p>
<p>[Here follows unrelated discussion.]</p>
<p>Senator Engle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General, I only have two questions and perhaps you covered one of them.</p>
<p>As I listened to your testimony this morning, we can’t win in Berlin, that is Berlin isolated by itself is not an area where we can fight successfully.</p>
<p>General Taylor. We probably could not win immediately in a military sense, but I don’t suggest for a moment that Berlin is not defensible. It is defensible by our clear determination to go all out, if necessary, in any kind of a military operation if we are really threatened with a situation from Berlin.</p>
<p>It can be defended, and in my judgment must be defended.</p>
<p>Senator Engle. What I am thinking about is how do you get to fighting the kind of war you can win? Now we don’t fight a war we can’t win, so if we limit ourselves to Berlin, we are trying to take a city or hold a city sitting right out in the middle of the communist sea. We don’t want to get the other end of the case where you have an all-out atomic and hydrogen war where everybody is throwing everything they have.</p>
<p>Now we don’t want that because no one wins one of those wars.</p>
<p>General Taylor. That is right.</p>
<p>Senator Engle. So in between someplace, in other words if you have to fight, what size war are you going to fight? Are you going to spread out and take the whole of East Germany?</p>
<p>General Taylor. No, I would first think there has been perhaps a little, a fallacy injected into my testimony by my not having made clear that I would doubt that we will encounter Soviet forces in the kind of patrolling of the highway that I anticipate. I believe the Soviets would follow certainly initially, their favorite tactic of the cat’s paw of war or military operation by proxy, and we would not necessarily see Soviet soldiers. There wouldn’t be one in sight, although his potential presence would be a constant threat to our operation.</p>
<p>I think we ought to visualize the problem the Soviets have to contemplate in any kind of a military operation in East Germany. They are tremendously vulnerable in the satellite area and the consequences of starting any kind of a shooting operation to them must look very dangerous, indeed.</p>
<p>So I personally believe that a strong, determined, active reaction to any threat by the East Germans will eventually lead them to modify their position.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_452" n="452" facs="0477"/>
<p>I can’t prove that, but I have that feeling.</p>
<p>Senator Engle. Well, we start out by probing to determine what their real intensions are.</p>
<p>General Taylor. Yes, is it a bluff, or are they going to stop one truck? If we find a man there with a gun to stop the truck, let’s send an armored detachment down and see if they stop that.</p>
<p>Senator Engle. Do we stop there or shoot?</p>
<p>General Taylor. I say we use the necessary force to go through or stop. How much further do we go?</p>
<p>Senator Engle. There is one on each side to determine if we have war, is that it?</p>
<p>General Taylor. No, I would say that the two sides at the outset will determine what our next move is going to be, whether we send forces in.</p>
<p>Senator Engle. After that is done, let’s assume the [shooting?] starts and we project force against force and we move into Berlin and they desire to hold it and they have fire power enough to run us out of there. Then what do we do?</p>
<p>General Taylor. In that case, they have gone so far that indeed they are initiating World War III.</p>
<p>Their problem is tougher than ours at every step that we describe, and if we just see our difficulties and our figures and don’t see the other fellow’s I am afraid apathy is the only thing we have to offer.</p>
<p>Senator Engle. Let’s go to the third step. We have gone to the point where the patrols meet. The patrol meets and we had to push our way in.</p>
<p>Now the third step is that we get into an all-out shooting, conventional war surrounding Berlin. Is that it?</p>
<p>General Taylor. I doubt that we get that far.</p>
<p>Senator Engle. Let’s assume it, General. We just have to assume that is maybe what will happen and they are going to pour it on us because they think with conventional weapons they can run us out.</p>
<p>Is their assumption right?</p>
<p>General Taylor. If we limited ourselves to conventional weapons, we could not hold Berlin. It is too far inland—110 miles from West Germany.</p>
<p>Senator Engle. All right, then you mean we would have to go to atomic weapons of one size or another. Is that what you are talking about?</p>
<p>General Taylor. I think you are talking about it. I am not. You are posing a situation which I don’t visualize as being reasonable.</p>
<p>It could happen. Virtually anything could happen, but I would visualize a stalemate on the Autobahn, five miles inside of Eastern <pb xml:id="pg_453" n="453" facs="0478"/>Germany and there is where you would decide is this stalemate acceptable or are we going to go by it?</p>
<p>Senator Engle. What I am trying to find out is whether or not we don’t get down to this situation: Don’t we get down to this situation where eventually we have to face the decision of using at least the small atomic weapons or be prepared to get run out?</p>
<p>General Taylor. I would go further and say from the very outset, before you start this, you must be resolved to use as much force as necessary to accomplish the mission.</p>
<p>Senator Engle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. General, the whole thesis of what you said is that we are determined to go to all out war against the Soviets, but we won’t have to do that. Is that your opinion?</p>
<p>General Taylor. That is my opinion.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. And is that the basis of your thinking? Would it be different if you came to the conclusion that the Soviets won’t back down and we would have to go to a nuclear war?</p>
<p>General Taylor. It would be a tough decision, Senator, when we analyze the repercussions from the loss of Berlin to force, particularly if we didn’t do our best.</p>
<p>Now I have always said, sir, and you may or may not agree, that it is better to try and to lose than not to try at all.</p>
<p>I am sure insofar as the world position is concerned, that fact is a fact. But, if we look at the results of losing West Berlin as I say, without trying our world position, our European position is so compromised that we are inevitably accepting Russian domination of the world and of our downgrading to a second or third class power.</p>
<p>With those stakes I would say that this is worth that, worth general war with the Soviets if we can see clearly that that is the alternative.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. So then if all negotiations fail, our decision not to give an inch remains firm, even if they are not bluffing?</p>
<p>General Taylor. I would say we must verify that they are not bluffing.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. And if they are not, then what?</p>
<p>General Taylor. If we verify that, that indeed they will use force to throw us out of Berlin, I say we must use all the necessary force to overcome it.</p>
<p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. And that would be?</p>
<p>General Taylor. It would be general war.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>United States Position on Berlin (<gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>)</item>
</list>
<p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff wish to express their concern over the need for a clear U.S. position on Berlin. They are impressed with the fact that the probable time of a showdown with the Soviets, May 27th, is rapidly approaching and much remains to be done in a political, military, and psychological sense to prepare for this emergency.</p>
<p>2. The present U.S. position on Berlin as known to the Joint Chiefs of Staff is contained in Appendix “A” hereto. This document in its present form is, in their opinion, defective in two important aspects. First, it limits preparatory measures to “quiet preparatory and precautionary military measures of a kind which will not create public alarm but which will be detectable by Soviet intelligence”. Second, the document does not face up to the vital need for decision now that the safety of Berlin is worth running the risk of a general war with the USSR.</p>
<p>3. With regard to the first point, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would point out that there exists a need to take at once those precautionary measures necessary to prepare for the outbreak of hostilities over Berlin at the time of the passage of USSR authority to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The military requirement for prompt action arises from consideration of the inevitable time lag needed to implement decisions affecting our military readiness.</p>
<p>4. Apart from the military need for taking these precautionary measures, there is a concomitant requirement to mobilize United States and Allied public opinion. While realizing that a delicate balance must be maintained between this need and the possibility of overexciting the nation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff feel that our present course of action is failing to bring home to our people the potential seriousness of the Berlin situation and the importance of the stakes involved. They are also impressed with a need to convince the Soviets of our earnestness, thus hoping to deter them from adverse actions and decisions, due to miscalculation, from which it may later be most difficult to withdraw. They endorse the thought contained in paragraph 14, NIE 100–2–59,<note n="1" xml:id="d212fn1">Not printed. (Department of State, INR–NIE Files)</note> that “the <pb xml:id="pg_455" n="455" facs="0480"/>USSR would almost certainly back away from a full turnover of access controls if it were convinced that the Western Powers were determined to use whatever degree of force was necessary to maintain access to Berlin free of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> controls, even if such use of force led to general war”. They agree also that this conviction will be most difficult to establish in the Soviet mind without making manifest preparations for war. Hence, they recommend openly making such preparations.</p>
<p>5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the most serious omission in the policy paper on Berlin is the absence of an unqualified assertion of determination to fight for Berlin if all other measures fail. They consider that the loss of Berlin would be a political and military disaster. Of potentially equal danger are concessions which may lead to this loss. The Joint Chiefs of Staff join with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> in feeling that “We must be prepared and ready, if all else fails, to wage nuclear war against the Soviets”. However, they are of the opinion that the Soviet Union is unlikely to risk general war to evict the Allies from Berlin, particularly at this time when the Soviet leaders probably recognize that the United States has a greater capability to inflict damage in general war upon them than they upon us. Thus, insofar as the danger of general war is concerned, we are now in a relatively better position than the USSR to have a showdown on Berlin provided we make timely preparations for all contingencies. Consequently, the Joint Chiefs of Staff urge that we now establish a clear, positive U.S. policy on Berlin and gain the adherence of our Allies through the strength of our own determination. To carry conviction with them as well as with the Soviet Union, we must be visibly prepared for military conflict growing out of the Berlin situation.</p>
<p>6. In consonance with the foregoing views, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommendations as to modifications to the policy paper (Appendix “A” hereto) are appended as Appendix “B” hereto. Additionally, they will submit from time to time to the Secretary of Defense specific proposals with regard to actions necessary to support U.S. policy on Berlin.</p>

<p><hi rend="strong">Appendix “A”</hi><note n="2" xml:id="d212fn2">Secret.</note></p>
<p rend="right">Washington, February 18, 1959.</p>
<p rend="center">BERLIN CONTINGENCY PLANNING</p>
<p>The re-examination of Berlin contingency planning which has been undertaken on the basis of the United States aide-mémoire of December 11, 1958 would be facilitated by a more precise description of the measures which would be taken to deal with and to prepare for a situation in which the USSR attempted to withdraw from its present functions with respect to the access of the Three Powers to Berlin and in which officials of the so-called “German Democratic Republic” (<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) refused to allow the traffic of the Three Powers to pass without submitting to some form of control.</p>
<p>Agreement should therefore be reached at this time on the more detailed plan of action outline in paragraphs 1 through 5 below.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">1. Measures to be Taken Immediately:</hi></p>
<p>(a) The Three Powers will continue their efforts to bring about a Foreign Ministers’ meeting with the USSR on the various aspects of the Germany question, as provided in instructions to 3 ambassadors in Moscow bearing in mind that one of the purposes of such a meeting would be to provide the USSR with a cover which could facilitate the modification or the indefinite postponement of its “ultimatum” that it will withdraw from its functions with relation to the Three Powers’ access to Berlin after May 27.</p>
<p>(b) In view of the possibility that the USSR may nonetheless withdraw from these functions and in order to provide evidence of the Three Powers’ determination to maintain their free access, the Three Powers will, in the period between now and May 27, take quiet preparatory and precautionary military measures of a kind which will not create public alarm but which will be detectable by Soviet intelligence. These measures will be planned and coordinated in the first instance by the military headquarters of the Three Powers in Germany. Recommendations for preparatory measures, regardless of origin, will be referred to the national Chiefs of Staff and thereafter be coordinated tripartitely or <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-wide as may be agreed, bearing in mind the availability of military advisers in Washington.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">2. Initial Probe of Soviet Intentions:</hi></p>
<p>After the announced or attempted withdrawal of Soviet personnel from the access checkpoints, the first Allied movement via the <pb xml:id="pg_457" n="457" facs="0482"/>Autobahn will be one or more trucks accompanied by a scout car or a comparable armed vehicle. If necessary, the vehicles will be identified to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials as vehicles of one of the Three Powers, but no stamping of papers or inspection by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials will be allowed. The movement will proceed until its passage is physically obstructed. It will not fire unless fired upon, but if fired upon will take whatever defensive action seems necessary.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">3. Possible Substitution of Allied for Soviet Personnel:</hi></p>
<p>The Three Powers might consider the possibility of substituting their own personnel for the Soviet personnel withdrawn from the Nowawes and Marienborn checkpoints.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">4. Efforts to Increase Pressure on USSR and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>:</hi></p>
<p>If the initial probe or probes described in paragraph 2 above is physically obstructed, the Three Powers will temporarily suspend surface traffic and will make parallel efforts along the following lines to increase pressure on the USSR and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) The Three Powers will seek to mobilize world opinion against the USSR as a violator of agreements, as a user of force, and as a threat to the peace. The situation could be taken to the United Nations Security Council and, in the event of a Soviet veto, to a special session of the General Assembly. Consideration would be given to further forms of diplomatic or other pressure, including the withdrawal of the Ambassadors of the Three Powers from Moscow.</item>
<item>(b) The Three Powers will intensify their military preparations. At this point the preparations could include measures which would be readily observable, for example, the evacuation of dependents from Berlin, and possibly from the Federal Republic.</item>
</list>
<p><hi rend="italic">5. Use of Additional Military Force:</hi></p>
<p>If the measures described in paragraph 4 above do not suffice to restore the free access of the Three Powers to Berlin, the Three Governments after suitable consultation will decide whether further military pressures should be applied. As a supplement to military pressures consideration might be given to possible economic measures.</p>
<p>The attitude of the Three Powers towards dealing with personnel at the Nowawes and Marienborn checkpoints should be also defined more precisely with respect to two points.</p>
<p>The first of these relates to the so-called “agency principle.” The Three Powers cannot deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel as Soviet agents if the USSR denies that such an agency relationship exists. If, however, the USSR should ultimately propose a compromise under which the USSR, as principal, would expressly authorize <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel to function as Soviet agents in performing Soviet functions with relation to the access of the Three Powers to Berlin, the Three Powers should consider the <pb xml:id="pg_458" n="458" facs="0483"/>possibility of accepting such a compromise solution, with appropriate safeguards for their own rights.</p>
<p>The second point involves the practical problem of identifying the vehicles of the Three Powers at the Nowawes and Marienborn checkpoints in order to establish that they constitute an Allied military movement enjoying the right of unrestricted passage between Berlin and West Germany. If Soviet personnel are withdrawn from the checkpoints, there would be no objection to providing mere identification of the vehicles of the Three Powers for the information of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel at the checkpoints. Such identification should not, however, include the stamping of papers or any other form of inspection or control, and it should not be construed as acquiescence in the substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for Soviet personnel. The Three Embassies at Bonn, after consultation with the military headquarters of the Three Powers in Germany, should determine the appropriate procedure for identifying the vehicles of the Three Powers and incorporate this identification procedure in the detailed instructions which the Embassies are now developing for Autobahn travel by military convoys and vehicles and by the privatelyowned vehicles of official personnel of the Three Powers.</p>

<p rend="center">PROPOSED CHANGES TO U.S. POSITION ON BERLIN</p>
<p>1. Delete paragraph 1 (b) and substitute the following:</p>
<list><item>“In view of the possibility that the USSR may nonetheless withdraw from these functions, between now and May 27, the Three Powers should take the necessary preparatory and pre-cautionary military measures to prepare for an outbreak of hostilities arising from the Soviet threat against Allied rights in Berlin. These actions will be given the visibility necessary to alert public opinion of the United States to the serious nature of the threat to Berlin and to convince the Soviets of U.S. and Allied resolution to resist any change in the present status of West Berlin.”

According <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> official <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> talks with <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> concentrated on Germany and Berlin but there was also some discussion of Africa and very briefly of free trade area. Prime Minister raised question French Mediterranean fleet and expressed objections “in general terms” to French action.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> at first meeting gave <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> summary <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s and his talks in Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> added that three points emerged from these talks: 1) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be satisfied with de facto rather than de jure recognition of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>, 2) Soviets willing for West Germany remain in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> for present and 3) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interested in a thinning out of forces in Europe. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said question for West was how to play hand. If decision were to push Berlin issue to point of war then various military measures such as mobilization should be undertaken. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> stressed importance of avoiding bluff from which we would subsequently have to back down. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> replied that he agreed West must consider possibility of military catastrophe over Berlin but should try to avoid it. Western unity essential. While West might accept no present prospect German reunification, essential maintain position in Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> showed no enthusiasm for disengagement or limitation of arms.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_460" n="460" facs="0485"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> gave summary of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> talks with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> found <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> realistic on reunification and prepared concentrate on European security. Germans reluctant to look at limited arms zones or disengagement because of possible implications for continued maintenance Western forces in Germany. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had aired views on general disarmament.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he had not discussed demilitarized zone or zone of special arms limitations with Russians and they had not for their part suggested neutralized or denuclearized Germany.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said four possibilities: 1) firm actions as well as words by West with respect Berlin, 2) Russians might not climb down and we would then have war, 3) we might have compromise (no indication in record of conversation that nature “compromise” spelled out), 4) we could conduct bluff which would be disastrous our interests. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> replied that we must decide what we can accept on Berlin and then hold firm. He suggested quadripartite consideration Berlin and tripartite study German question.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said Soviets publicly committed to negotiations and since it was clear negotiations should be with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> this meant a summit meeting. West might propose summit end of July or early August with Foreign Ministers’ meeting to prepare for summit.</p>
<p>In discussion March 10 between <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> former said he was opposed to replacing Western forces with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces in Berlin since this merely variant Soviet free city proposal. With respect zone of limitation of forces <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said such arrangement must not 1) disturb military balance, 2) result in break up of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or 3) in withdrawal US forces from Europe. Subject to these considerations UK was prepared to look at plans for zone of limitation of forces. He added however that Rapacki Plan<note n="1" xml:id="d213fn1">See <ref target="#d43fn2">footnote 2, Document 43</ref>.</note> or neutralization of Germany not acceptable. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said might be some advantage in setting up zone with provision for inspection in area of Germany east of Rhine with corresponding area east of <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> frontier but matter would have to be discussed with Germans. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said such scheme should be part of package deal including settlement of Berlin but not providing for German reunification. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> stressed control features as most important aspect zone of limitations. He also thought zone might constitute start toward disarmament and useful anti-surprise attack measure.</p>
<p>In meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> March 10 <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> took firm line on Berlin saying we must insist on our right of passage and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would back down since he doesn’t want war. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> agreed but said negotiations must come first. He again stressed that if we are going to <pb xml:id="pg_461" n="461" facs="0486"/>threaten we must take supporting actions such as for example mobilization. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that since France had no atomic weapons its resources in showdown limited and that it would be mainly matter for United States. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> agreed on need for summit but doubtful on proposing date for it. He remarked that he felt no sense of urgency in arranging summit talks but perhaps British had internal political reasons for wishing early summit. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> replied that proposing early summit meeting might dissuade Russians from taking precipitate action. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> also willing have examination, without commitment, of new arrangements for Berlin but made it clear we should meanwhile continue maintain legal basis our presence Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said we should encourage some “cooperation” between two Germanies since reunification through free elections not possible at moment. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> agreed on desirability increased contacts between Federal Republic and <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> but said <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> afraid of expanding Communist influence in Federal Republic. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said he had told <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> firmly that new frontiers a fact which would have to be accepted and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had agreed not only with respect Oder Neisse but also Czech frontier.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> reverting to Berlin said alternatives were to 1) stand on existing rights or 2) negotiate new status. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he favored second alternative since this would provide opportunity strengthen our legal position in city. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> expressed doubts about value new agreement with Soviets and opposed any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> solution which would open way to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> interference Western rights Berlin.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> thought blockade Berlin unlikely but if it occurred West should not give in. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> agreed that essential question in event of hand over by Russians to <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> was whether route blocked rather than who stamped what.<note n="2" xml:id="d213fn2">On March 12 the Department of State cabled Paris, London, Bonn, Berlin, and Moscow that <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> had also given a brief rundown on <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s visit to Paris.

<p>1. We met with <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dixon</persName>, Beeley and other members UK Del and de Vaucelles of French Del with his advisers to exchange views on methods by which <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might be seized of Berlin question as well as general discussion of timing, tactics and related matters pursuant <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>s 735 and 741.<note n="1" xml:id="d214fn1">See <ref target="#d210fn1">Document 210 and footnote 1</ref> thereto.</note> Although mtg did not reach any firm conclusion, believe it certainly had educational effect. We plan further mtg tentatively scheduled 13 March. Following is paraphrase of what we said:</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>: It seems inevitable that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would eventually be seized of Berlin matter. It was out of question to believe <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would not have to deal with it. Only question is by whom, at what time, and how. Re timing, seizure could be (1) before any change of status quo, (2) after change but before West reacts, (3) during or after West reaction. Speaking personally rather than expressing official view, since there had been no decision taken, we should go to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> before any breach of status quo including even a paper change such as a transfer of Soviet power to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and call for a standstill and four power negotiations. In order to avoid danger which would result if Soviets transferred power during Foreign Ministers’ conference, three powers should go to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> in this preventive type of action before Foreign Ministers’ conference. This is only way avoid situation where Soviets could change status quo and go to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, thereby gaining initiative, putting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s well-known pro-status quo feelings on Soviet side, and thus restraining three power reaction. Whatever we do here must be coordinated carefully with our over-all strategy.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dixon</persName>: My analysis leads to similar conclusion that subject almost bound come to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. But present need is to relate various possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> actions to general policy on over-all problem. We do not yet know what our over-all policy is going to be. UK Del saw two different kinds of action (1) first, diplomatic use of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, designed support our case and expose illegalities of Soviet proposals, for example, by calling for <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> consideration or <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> advisory opinion, or by using <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> in some manner. Another example of diplomatic use would be summit meeting under <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> aegis; however, <gloss target="#t_ChiComs1">ChiComs</gloss> would probably again prevent <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s <pb xml:id="pg_463" n="463" facs="0488"/>attendance as was case last fall. (2) Other use of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be to put to Soviets substantive proposals for use of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery such as, for example, (a) some form of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force (for which recruitment would be admittedly difficult), (b) movement <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> headquarters or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Geneva offices to Berlin or West Berlin (as <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dixon</persName> understood <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> favored) or (c) some form of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commission. (<gloss target="#t_UKDel1">UKDel</gloss> thinking in terms of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commission which would have some operation as between East and West Berlin sectors and along access routes and which would supplement but not supplant West forces in Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dixon</persName> mentioned <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s role in checking convoys to and from Mt. Scopus. He felt this approach had real merit and deserves further study.) Proposing use of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery in such fashion should precede “diplomatic” use of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Our case in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would be on more firm grounds if substantive proposal along lines of second course had been proposed to Soviets and rejected by them. Our position would be strongest in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> if Soviets had previously rejected substantive proposal along these lines and if Soviets had physically obstructed our access to Berlin. Fear we would be on weak grounds if we went to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> before obstruction had taken place since Soviets could argue only threat to peace stemmed from our intention to use force. If we reacted in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> before physical interference by Soviets, this act by itself might precipitate physical interference even if this were not original Soviet intention.</p>
<p>4. De Vaucelles: <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> is primarily concerned that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> not be allowed to paralyze our ability to respond to change of status quo. <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> favors awaiting physical interference, then reacting with whatever force necessary and simply informing <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> simultaneously of action taken in self-defense per Article 51. <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> felt we must not be limited in four power negotiations to Berlin only, but on other hand <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could only be concerned with Berlin and not larger problems of Germany or peace treaty. Berlin would be only question on <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> agenda. Therefore <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> did not favor setting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery in motion in any way until after Soviets obstructed and West reacted. In any case we should avoid action in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> which permitted Soviets to limit further negotiations to Berlin only.</p>
<p>5. After more argument by <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> all finally agreed worst timing for submission by three powers to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would be after physical interference but before Western reaction.</p>
<p>6. Re Soviet tactics and arguments. British said Soviets would tend to favor consideration in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, not <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, since <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> hard to control and more tempted by its nature to work for solutions through compromise in which West would lose. We would find it difficult to demonstrate that mere transfer of rights to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or our refusal to permit <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> stamp our documents is menace to peace; Soviets have easy reply that only threat lies in our assertion we need use force. In <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> Soviets would be on firm grounds in arguing that only threat to peace was presence our forces in <pb xml:id="pg_464" n="464" facs="0489"/>Berlin and they would probably ask <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> to bring about withdrawal those forces.</p>
<p>7. But, in spite of the above talk about <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, when <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> asked specifically what UK thought Soviets would be most likely to do Beeley said that, having heard U.S. argument, he believed most likely Soviet plan would be move into <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> after they had altered status quo so as to seize initiative and prevent us from reacting. He agreed with <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> that since this would be most dangerous move from our viewpoint, it would be most likely Soviet move.</p>
<p>8. <gloss target="#t_UKDel1">UKDel</gloss> noted inscription of Berlin item during earlier <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> consideration had been opposed by Soviets on basis Article 107.<note n="2" xml:id="d214fn2">In 1948 the Soviet Union had rejected the proposal of taking the Berlin question to the Security Council; see <ref target="frus1948v02"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1948, vol. II</ref>, p. 1210.</note></p>
<p>9. As to Soviet objectives <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dixon</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was impressed by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s desire to solidify his position in Eastern Europe and by his pathological fear of espionage from West Berlin (as well as from our disarmament inspection schemes). Although <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interested in meeting President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not put too much stress on summit meeting. Impression resulting was that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, while bargaining for more, was willing to settle for our acceptance of status quo plus some greater recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and would do this even in four power negotiations at <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s level.</p>
<p>10. Although agreed would be advantageous if we seized <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> before any change in status quo, this presented many dangers if done despite Soviet objections. One hypothetical possibility discussed was that of using summit as “bait” in order bring about Soviet cooperation or, at least, noninterference; <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would be called upon to ask for standstill in order bring about summit meeting preceded by Foreign Ministers’ conference. We made clear U.S. did not favor summit meeting.</p>
<p>11. Re initiatives other than by three powers, it was generally agreed Berlin is so much a four power responsibility that three powers could not afford let anyone else take initiative. (Earlier, however, <gloss target="#t_UKDel1">UKDel</gloss> indicated vague possibility of using <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> in some manner.)</p>
<p>12. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dixon</persName> asked how East and West Germans might be associated with any <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action. De Vaucelles pointed out Soviets recognize both and could accept presence of both at <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. He asked if we could. We agreed this matter deserves study.</p>
<p>13. <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dixon</persName> also noted frequent local inquiries and said at some stage we must talk to Germans, plus <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members, plus other <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members, as well as press. It was agreed for time being we would say nothing.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_465" n="465" facs="0490"/>
<p>14. Although inconclusive, group felt exchange of views useful and should be resumed after capitals had chance react to various views set forth.</p>
<p>15. While leaving meeting <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dixon</persName> said to <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>: “you out-argued us.”</p>

<dateline><placeName>Paris</placeName>, <date when="1959-03-12">March 12, 1959</date>.</dateline>
<p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
<p>Dear General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>,</p>
<p>In the crisis that has arisen over Berlin, I wish to point out to you what I believe to be essential concerning the attitude that we of the West should jointly adopt.</p>
<p>In my opinion, we must not, above all, give in to any ultimatum, especially regarding the movements of our forces and supplies between Berlin and West Germany. We have the right of passage. Hindrance to our passage on the part of anyone would therefore constitute a deliberate act of force against us. We should have to oppose such an act with like means. The responsibility for what might follow would fall upon those who first used force to prevent us from going to a place to which we have the right to go. In my opinion, this is the essential point. It could, moreover, be decisive, for I have the feeling that the Soviet leaders do not wish this situation to lead to war.</p>
<p>Having said this, I do not believe that we should reject negotiation through normal channels on all the problems that the Russians, or we ourselves, would like to bring up. Not that I have many illusions concerning the likelihood of an effective settlement. However, in view of world-wide apprehension, an attitude of refusal to hold talks would, in my opinion, present more disadvantages than advantages. It goes without saying that, before a “summit” conference is held and even before a date is set for one, a meeting of foreign ministers should be called and be <pb xml:id="pg_466" n="466" facs="0491"/>allowed to remain in session for some time. Matters should be carried no further if such a meeting failed to yield good probabilities of agreement on some important points.</p>
<p>With respect to the German problem as a whole, we could not of course abandon the principle that reunification should take place just as soon as circumstances permit. It is on the basis of this principle that we must refrain from recognizing the “German Democratic Republic” as a sovereign State, but, the ideal having been acclaimed and the distant goal designated, the fact remains that reunification is not possible at the present time. For that to become possible, we must either impose it upon Soviet Russia by force—which is not our intention—or Russia must agree to German unity on the basis of freedom, which it certainly will not do. However, while not ceasing to condemn the oppression whereby the communist system is preventing the inhabitants of Prussia and Saxony from expressing their will, we could very strongly and very urgently recommend that as numerous and broad relations as possible be established between the two Germanies.</p>
<p>Such relations would not, of course, be directed toward the establishment of a common political régime but would be deliberately limited to such practical fields as transportation, postal communications, economic cooperation, supply, culture, movement of persons, etc. But the very fact that contacts would be multiplied between Germans, within and to the benefit of the “German State,” would keep alive the hope of the people in their future unity. In any case, such an attitude on the part of the Western powers would give their policy a constructive character.</p>
<p>With respect to the status of Berlin, the following position, should, in my opinion, be maintained in any event: West Berlin is a Western city and wishes to remain so. We could not agree to have it otherwise. That is why nothing would be worse than to let it be assumed that we could a priori consider the withdrawal of our forces. Our presence is a right which we do not have to debate, even if the Russians pretend to waive that right for themselves. If they later propose measures and guarantees concerning West Berlin that actually satisfy us, it will then be time to examine the question of our garrisons.</p>
<p>The matter of “disengagement” would appear in an entirely different light, depending on whether it was a question of controlled limitation of armaments of all kinds over a very widespread area, for example, all Europe, the Arctic region, etc....,<note n="1" xml:id="d215fn1">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> or of demilitarization, that is to say, neutralization of Germany and, with their apparent counterpart, a similar system applied to East Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_467" n="467" facs="0492"/>
<p>In the first case, we should have no reason to refuse to engage in discussions. In the second case, we should do it only if the States that are to become buffer States are first returned to their own people through free elections giving rise to the formation of free governments, without which their neutralization would be only a means of tricking us.</p>
<p>In any case, it seems to me that you Americans, the British, and we French are not in very close agreement in this grave international situation. Of course it is true that, for many political and geographical reasons, we are impelled to consider matters from a somewhat different point of view. However, it is you, the Americans, who at present possess the most powerful means—and by far—of the Western forces. I believe however, as I wrote to you a short while ago, that it is of vital interest to the free world that our cooperation at the world level be organized in the political field—since the questions involved could lead to war—and in the strategic field.</p>
<p>If events should cause you to pay a personal visit to France in the near future, this is a subject which, if you are willing, we should have occasion to examine most carefully together.</p>
<p>Please accept, Mr. President, the expression of my highest consideration and sincere friendship.</p>

<p>3373. For <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d216fn1"><persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> was in Paris as Head of the U.S. Delegation to the Four-Power Working Group; see <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> Bonn’s 1962; Moscow’s 1747, 1774; London’s 4654, 4671.<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">Telegram 1747 is printed as <ref target="#d197">Document 197</ref>. The other telegrams dealt with various aspects of the draft reply to the Soviet note of March 2. (Telegram 1962, Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/3–959; telegrams 1774 and 4654, <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 396.1/3–959; telegram 4671, <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 396.1/3–1059)</note> Department believes there remains advantage in preserving our long-held position on form of proceeding to Summit meeting, i.e., through Foreign Ministers’ meeting which has dealt in <pb xml:id="pg_468" n="468" facs="0493"/>substance with some problems at least, as indication of strength our basic approach to negotiations and to dampen Soviet enthusiasm about their capabilities for shaping form of negotiation. While we inclined agree that any sizeable Soviet concession is unlikely occur except in meeting at which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speaks for Soviet Union, Foreign Ministers’ meeting could have value of setting forth in understandable fashion both to Soviets and world public merits of Western position. It could also give some indication of what we might be faced with re Soviet positions in subsequent Summit meeting.</p>
<p>As British have pointed out intervening time between present and proposed mid-Summer Summit meeting can be advantageously used in conditioning public opinion. May Foreign Ministers’ meeting provides both time and forum.</p>
<p>To gain maximum value from Foreign Ministers’ meeting it should be generally understood that meeting would deal in substance. Thus we prefer in our reply to Soviets to indicate readiness for Summit meeting should progress of Foreign Ministers’ meeting indicate that such is appropriate.</p>
<p>Agenda for Foreign Ministers’ meeting clearly raises great difficulty. It must be acceptable to Soviets while giving us opportunity broaden range of questions considered. At same time any language suggested must not give public impression that major unreciprocated concession has been made by West re agenda. Language suggested in US draft note<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> was taken from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed communiqué<note n="4" xml:id="d216fn4">See <ref target="#d198fn1">footnote 1, Document 198</ref>.</note> as meeting these requirements. Main element in negotiations themselves, of course, is what Western Powers are prepared assert as their interpretation of phraseology agreed upon and program of discussion they will insist upon at meeting. While we do not insist on specific mention of reunification on formal agenda as matter for discussion by Foreign Ministers it difficult see how there could be discussion peace treaty drafts or principles without consideration of subject. Department recognizes difficulty suggested in Moscow’s 1774 for Foreign Ministers in fixing agenda for Summit meeting if reunification discussion becomes pointed issue at Foreign Ministers’ meeting. However Department has some question about <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s willingness or capability deal with reunification at Summit meeting since he would be called upon to make concessions concerning system in East Germany, particularly re human rights, which should be applicable by analogy to other Soviet bloc systems but which he could not afford permit. Department believes any concessions he might make, in any event, would be result <pb xml:id="pg_469" n="469" facs="0494"/>of pressures on him on specific issues rather than emerging as his voluntary contributions toward compromise. Since our present objective in negotiation is at minimum to develop better public posture, and much of effort in formulating proposals is directed to this end, such clarification of present status of reunification issue as can be attained at Foreign Ministers’ meeting would seem have some value all around.</p>
<p>Re Bonn’s 1962, excerpt from Soviet note of March 2<note n="5" xml:id="d216fn5">See <ref target="#d194">Document 194</ref>.</note> re access was included in our draft with idea making clear expressed intent of Soviet Government itself and thus underscore its consequent responsibility if it were to conclude separate treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Balance of para was designed reaffirm our refusal tolerate <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interference with access. Re Moscow’s 1774, Department agrees unilateral Soviet action to hinder access is unlikely before negotiations begin. But negotiations and preparations therefor may extend over considerable time and draft note’s language was meant point out to Soviets detrimental nature of such an act at any time in process.</p>
<p>Re Polish and Czech participation we understand UK now prepared agree this matter should be, in first instance, dealt with as suggested in US draft. In view difficulties connected with additional western as well as eastern participation, we prefer handle it this way at least for now.</p>

<p>Dear Acting Secretary Of State, Immediately on his return to London this evening, the Foreign Secretary sent a telegram asking me to let you know that the Prime Minister and he have had a prolonged discussion with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr Von Brentano</persName> about our Note to the Russians.<note n="1" xml:id="d217fn1">On March 16 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJH1">Whitney</persName> reported that the Foreign Office had briefed the Embassy in London along similar lines. (Telegram 4782 from London; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Central Files, 033.4162A/3–1659) For two other accounts of the visit, see <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Riding the Storm</hi>, pp. 639–640, and <ref target="#d219">Document 219</ref>.</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_470" n="470" facs="0495"/>
<p>The Germans agreed with the arguments which the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary used about a Summit Meeting. They were:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is the only Russian with whom a negotiation could be successfully conducted;</item>
<item>(b) We cannot be expected to take vital decisions involving the possibility of war before there has been a Summit Meeting;</item>
<item>(c) If it is known that there is going to be a Summit Meeting, then the meeting of Foreign Ministers is more likely to produce some useful results;</item>
<item>(d) The Russians would have no incentive to precipitate a crisis if a Summit Meeting was fixed, and world opinion would be against them if they started something in the meantime;</item>
<item>(e) If, on the contrary, no date had been fixed for a Summit it would be in their interest to start something precisely in order to force us to a Summit under the pressure of a crisis;</item>
<item>(f) A wide agenda including e.g. disarmament could only be obtained at a Summit Conference.</item>
</list>
<p>The Chancellor thought that we should so word our Note as to suggest that the Summit Meeting which we were proposing would be the first of a series. As to the date, he prefers “August” to “the end of July or beginning of August”.</p>
<p>As regards the agenda of the Foreign Ministers’ meeting, we accepted the view that if a definite date was proposed for the subsequent Summit Meeting <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be less likely to resist a formula such as that suggested in the American draft reply<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note>—“Questions relating to Germany, including a peace treaty with Germany and the question of Berlin”. If the date for the Summit was included in the Note, we would accept such a formula. In fact we recognized that one of the arguments in favour of fixing this date was that it would probably have the effect of enabling us to avoid a wrangle about the agenda of the Foreign Ministers’ conference with which public opinion would have little patience.</p>
<p>The Chancellor made the point that in offering <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> a Summit Conference, we ought somehow to tie him down to taking no unilateral action to disturb matters in the meantime. Although it would go without saying that our offer was made on this understanding it would nevertheless be better to say it. The Ministers discussed whether this might best be said through the diplomatic channel or in the Note itself and left that over for further thought.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary agreed with the Germans that until they had had time to discuss these ideas with you in Washington, it might be best for the Working Group in Paris to suspend <pb xml:id="pg_471" n="471" facs="0496"/>their discussion about the Note and turn to other matters, e.g. the questionnaire, and possible Berlin solutions.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary realise that large issues are involved about which the United States Government may wish to have time to reflect before reaching a decision. They thought that you would like to know what passed in Bonn and they look forward to pursuing the discussions next week.</p>
<p>Of course if you have any preliminary view about the matters raised in this letter, I shall be glad to convey them to the Foreign Secretary. As you know, he will be leaving London with the Prime Minister next Tuesday evening, March 17, for Ottawa.</p>
<p>Most sincerely,</p>

<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> opened the meeting by reading points which he understood had been agreed upon by the Inter Departmental working <pb xml:id="pg_472" n="472" facs="0497"/>group on the Berlin situation.<note n="1" xml:id="d218fn1">See <ref target="#d208">Document 208</ref>.</note> The first point was that all of the actions contemplated in a discussion paper<note n="2" xml:id="d218fn2">Presumably a reference to Appendix A to <ref target="#d212">Document 212</ref>.</note> which had been circulated depended to a greater or lesser degree upon cooperation and support of our allies, U.K., France and West Germany. It was agreed that there should not be any added public opinion drive at this time, also that the President should not be asked to rescind his decision on the 30,000 man reduction in the Armed Forces, but that strength in Europe should be restored. The desirability of referring the question of the Soviets turning over to the Germans control of allied access to Berlin to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion should be examined. While noting the President’s opinion that we should not accept East German credentials, the working group pointed out that K-Day would actually occur when allied access to Berlin is forcibly blocked and we have to mount a probe, rather than automatically on May 27. If the East German officials attempt to exercise sovereignty by stamping documents, we will not accede, but will then move ahead until forcibly blocked.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> cited the importance of determining what we mean when we say “forcibly blocked”.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> continued the list of agreed working group points, the next of which was that in no event would the U.S. initiate general war. Even if negotiations are still under way and our access forcibly blocked, we would still want to try a probe. It was agreed that we should take the problem to the United Nations after we have been forcibly blocked and tried a probe. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> questioned when general war would happen, for example, suppose our people had been subjected to military action by the Soviets in connection with Berlin. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that then the Soviets would have been the ones who had initiated general war. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> thought that the working group’s statement was not referring to initiating general war, but rather to preventive war. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> thought that this point was already clearly covered in existing approved policy.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said the next point agreed by the working group was that general mobilization should be deferred until after K-Day. Then we would probably go into general mobilization, although it might be only partial mobilization. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> cautioned that whatever was put in writing on this subject and submitted to the President was liable to leak. He, therefore, felt that any such written documentation should be looked at from the point of view of what would happen if it got out publicly. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> thought that after various <pb xml:id="pg_473" n="473" facs="0498"/>points were agreed by the President we should then look at what the Russians should know.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that there would be many variables which could not now be foreseen, especially when K-Day occurs. He thought K-Day was unlikely before May 27, but from there on we might have to deal with the East Germans. From then on we would have to make clear our response. One of the questions would be what we do if a single East German sentry refuses us access. Would we then go immediately to the United Nations. There is also a question of whether, following our initial probe, we try a second probe of considerable force. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> said he did not think much of the latter idea. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he did not either. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought that we must assume that if we get into a fight it will be a big one.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> then read a list of actions<note n="3" xml:id="d218fn3">See <ref target="#d201fn8">footnote 8, Document 201</ref>.</note> which the Joint Chiefs were now taking. Concerning the types of convoy, both General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> felt that we should do the same thing after the Soviets turnover to the East Germans as we did the day before. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> thought it might be desirable to build up the type of convoy before such a turnover, although not necessarily including a scout car in the convoy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> noted that our military planning was based upon the assumption that we would not negotiate with the East Germans as Soviet agents.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that this assumption was correct, but that it was possible we might be able to negotiate an acceptable settlement before the turnover takes place. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that it would be all right for the East Germans to request identity papers but any inspection or blocking by them would not be accepted.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought that it was necessary that we send some people (preferably someone who understands the problem fully) to go up and down the corridor with convoys. He said it is extremely important to avoid the appearance of being very aggressive on what may be construed publicly as a technicality. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> said we must distinguish between policing of traffic and control of access. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the Joint Chiefs would send someone from the Joint Staff. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> questioned whether someone from State should also go, probably from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName>’s office.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> feels that what the Soviets will try to do is to force us to negotiate with the East Germans. That in itself would constitute a recognition that the Soviets have the right to turn over to the East Germans. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> thought that it was very <pb xml:id="pg_474" n="474" facs="0499"/>important to have clear instructions for the first convoy after such a turnover.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> asked whether acceptance of the stamping of papers by the East Germans would constitute recognition. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that if we accepted such stamping, we would then be on a slippery slope, with the danger of losing our entire rights in Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out that the right of the East Germans to regulate civilian traffic has already been recognized. We were prepared, therefore, to accept an East German request for identification to distinguish an allied convoy from civilian traffic.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that if we do not recognize East German rights, they must then be forced to stop us. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> said that the trouble is if the East Germans gave one of our convoys a mark of identity, the next convoy would be required to have such a mark. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> said that if we accept East German identification, we are then saying that the East Germans have a right to question such identification.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> thought that this problem involves two inter-related steps. First, if the Soviets turn over to the East Germans, we will protest and say that it does not affect our rights. If the East Germans then say they have the right to question our free access, the minutiae regarding clearance procedures will have assumed new proportions. If the East Germans say nothing, but then move to control our traffic, that will constitute K-Day.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> said that the problem of refusing to accept East Germans stamping documents would be difficult to explain in the United Nations. He pointed out that we must be able to get support in the United Nations that what we are doing is right. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that is why we are considering referring the question of credentials to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> said that we must have someone check as to whether any East German stamp would constitute control of access. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> pointed out that such questions testify to the need for a thorough understanding of convoy procedures. He thought we should not reach any final decisions regarding these procedures until after people have been sent to study the existing procedures. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> thought that we could agree now that we would not accept any forcible denial. Then later we could determine what constitutes denial in terms of the minutiae of clearance procedures.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_475" n="475" facs="0500"/>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> thought that the study of the convoy procedures should also include the following points: First, a careful study of the existing forms of Soviet access to West Germany, and how important such access was; secondly, what is done on the railroads where there is customs control when it passes from East to West Germany; third, a study of the procedures for access by air.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> pointed out that we have now been flying in the corridors above 2,500 feet and below 10,000 feet. He said that if we have to start an airlift to Berlin, we would want to use new aircraft at higher altitudes. Defense, therefore, thought that they might start now using C–130’s at around 25,000 feet. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that they had discussed this question in the State Department and that they did not feel that they were savvy enough to make the military judgment involved. He felt that if Defense needed to do this, then they should. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out that the Russians had said that if we fly over 10,000 feet they cannot give assurance of air safety. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> questioned why we could not start flying above 10,000 feet with the type of aircraft now in use. He suggested that this would not give away that we were contemplating the use of an airlift.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defines an attack on one as an attack on all. Therefore, the British and French are in the same position as the U.S. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> said that this was why he felt we should have a solid position before Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> arrives.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> referred back to the question of airlift and said that a plane flying between 25 hundred and 10 thousand feet was very vulnerable to ground fire. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> said he thought that the 10 to 20 thousand-foot altitude was reserved for civilian traffic control, and that this is why we wished to fly at 25,000 feet and above. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said this problem also raises the question of whether the Russians will pull out of the Berlin air control center.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> proposed that the question of flying at higher altitudes be put up to the President. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> also said that Defense will send people to get a specific report on ground, rail, air, and canal procedures for access to Berlin. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that the State Department would also have someone from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName>’s office go over to study these procedures. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> again recommended that we not overlook the reciprocal aspects of Soviet access into West Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> suggested that when the people come back from their study of access procedures, it would also be desirable to bring back a U.S. official from the Three-power working group on Berlin contingency planning.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_476" n="476" facs="0501"/>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> was coordinator within State in preparing for the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit. He suggested that Defense let Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> know anything that they wanted on the agenda.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> returned to the question of what actually constitutes obstruction of our access. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that there has got to be an element of force used in stopping us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> said that we would not be able to get on the Berlin road without some form of action, because there is a bar at the East German checkpoint. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that we would try to get through without shooting so that they would be the ones who would have to shoot first.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> pointed out that if they stop us to check identity then there is a question of what they will accept. If they do not accept our identification, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> said he understood we would not then attempt to raise the bar. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> questioned what we would do if the East Germans do the same as the previous Russian pattern. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said we would deny the East Germans right to do so. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> pointed out that how we denied that right is very important for U.N. purposes.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> suggested, and it was agreed, that we should have a full photographic record of what happens to convoys going through.</p>
<p>In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that they would have to decide whether to break off diplomatic relations with the Soviets at the time that the turnover takes place. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said they are also looking at the possibility of a limited blockade of the USSR, even though he realizes that the President is not enthusiastic about this idea.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked why we should not take photographs of the present convoy operations, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> agreed that we would.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> then enumerated various things that the Joint Chiefs of Staff thought should be done. First, he said that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> were unhappy about two points. One was that military action should now go beyond those which could be picked up by Soviet intelligence. The second was that we have a firm U.S. position before <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> arrives, and a clear decision as to whether we would go all the way down the line to war.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> asked whether the British questioned this latter decision. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said the British do not disagree with our basic position, but may want to drag out negotiations for a long time. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought we should be prepared to adjust some positions with the British, but not our basic decision.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> said that the problem may arise with the British as to whether, if we are forcibly blocked, we decide now that we would use <pb xml:id="pg_477" n="477" facs="0502"/>force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said the British maintain they cannot accept that decision as a matter of principle without joint planning.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that if you assume we are stopped and take the problem to the U.N., we are in effect imposing a blockade upon ourselves. He questioned how long we would wait for U.N. action. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought that we should test our access each day. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> believed that we should use whatever force was needed progressively.</p>
<p>[<hi rend="italic">3 paragraphs</hi> (<hi rend="italic">29 lines of source text</hi>) <hi rend="italic">not declassified</hi>] Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> commented that the arrangements for Berlin were created at a time when the Soviets were supposed to be our friends and the Germans our enemies. Today the situation is the opposite. He thought that we should make clear that the issue is not a question of whether the Soviets transfer their rights to the East Germans, but whether they abridge our rights. He thought we were not sufficiently cultivating the attitude of the German people on this question. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that the Germans were the ones who put steel into the details of our position, especially regarding East Germans stamping documents. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> felt that we should not be strapped by the West Germans who themselves accept many forms of relations with the East Germans.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> felt that further efforts should be made to try to clarify the points of issue in the public’s mind, even thought there was not a major campaign. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that the President’s Monday talk<note n="4" xml:id="d218fn4">See <ref target="#d225">Document 225</ref>.</note> would be designed to provide such clarification. He expressed his view that not everybody in Government should get in on the act of clarifying our position. He said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> was working on the drafts of the President’s talk.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he agreed that we should reexamine our whole position in detail before <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s arrival, and be prepared to hold a solid line. He said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that he came back from Europe with a firm agreement with the British, French and Germans that we would not accept a blockade of our access to Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> thought that the British differ with us on two points. First, they have doubts as to whether we should refuse to accept East Germans stamping documents; second, they contemplated a longer negotiating period before more force is applied. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that there was a basic agreement with our allies and, in fact, with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said the problem was mainly one of hashing out the details of our position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> commented that the French seem to be taking a tough position with our troops.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_478" n="478" facs="0503"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> asked whether there was anything which the Joint Chiefs wanted to do, to which the British and French could contribute. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that some of the steps would involve or be taken by our allies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> commented that the British have long urged joint plans but we have been opposed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> differed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s statement, saying that we have only declined joint planning in Washington but that such planning had been done in Europe.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> reported that he has set aside on the President’s calendar the time from 9 to 10:30 a.m. on Thursday morning for the regular <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting. This time would, therefore, be available if it was needed for other purposes.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> said that if we assume that we have failed in a diplomatic solution to forcible denial of our access to Berlin, we will then be faced with three choices: One would be further military action to gain entry to Berlin; the second would be a possible blockade of the USSR; and the third would be general war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> suggested that there should be a joint State–Defense study of these alternatives in the same manner that had been done regarding possible action in Korea.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> said it was his understanding that the Joint Chiefs are planning that, if our diplomacy fails, we will attempt to force access to Berlin. He said that what was puzzling is what would happen if our allies do not go along with us on that. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought we should say that we are going to maintain access to Berlin.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that there will be probing as to the actions we are going to take from all sides. He proposed, and it was agreed, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> would prepare recommendations to the President along the lines discussed in this meeting, including the question of a possible joint State–Defense study of alternatives.</p>

If in exercise your own judgment, you think advisable show this message selected officers Dept, that thoroughly satisfactory to me. In view Chancellor’s ineradicable conviction President [<hi rend="italic">Secretary?</hi>] ill man, I have little choice about how to convey this present account, especially since Chancellor anxious certain parts go only to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName>.</p>
<p>Last night, after <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had accompanied <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> airport he sent for me. First, he spoke of how satisfactory his visit <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had been,<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">See <ref target="#d203">Document 203</ref>.</note> the cordiality of their relationship, and the mutuality of their views on European problems. He indicated they had not descended to particulars, but had remained on mountain top.</p>
<p>Re <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, with whom he had been in intermittent conversation for thirty hours, he had following observations to make.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had taken <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to task for the mention of disengagement in Moscow communiqué. British <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had answered he had been misinterpreted by Western press.</p>
<p>Having jumped this hurdle, and knocked over all the bars, the two continued in strict privacy, while their Foreign Ministers kicked about in another room. Result, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> thinks, should be carefully analyzed in Washington.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> related impressions derived from Moscow trip. His listener was not impressed, either by this, or by subsequent knowledge of same conclusions imparted by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName>. Chancellor thought they had incorrectly assessed Soviet intentions. British seemed unaware Soviets have different set political morals from Western ones, and what they term morals are utterly deplorable. British over-rate <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s position in <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Union.</p>
<p>Discussions on first day with <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> were tough, because British diplomacy had not profoundly considered implications subjects under scrutiny, particularly disengagement. Posture and tactics British Labor Party opposition play great part in <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s attitude, and <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> evaded answer when queried as to who inserted mention of disengagement in communiqué.</p>
<p>After their preliminary talks, they returned to feast following day, while <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> sat well below the salt.<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">This sentence was not in telegram 2024.</note></p>
<p><gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> made as essential points:</p>
<p>1. Present situation dangerous and might lead to war. British ready to take risks, but owe it to their people to try to avoid war.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_480" n="480" facs="0505"/>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is minor character in Soviet cast. Much less important than was Molotov. A technician, a tool. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> treats and regards him as such.</p>
<p>3. Therefore, in <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> conference, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would not allow <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to make major decisions, and instead desires summit conference.</p>
<p>4. Consequently, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, realizing situation, will use his influence to induce Western nations agree to summit meeting, with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s as prelude.</p>
<p>5. Further, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> believes <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will only enter into genuine negotiations, if given definite summit date, perhaps August.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> rejoined by offering opinion <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would indeed try to sabotage possibility real achievement in <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> meeting. But, on other hand, he did not subscribe to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> proposal of “A Summit Conference”. He thought there should be a series of Summit meetings, denominated “First Stage, Second Stage etc.” The first might perhaps last eight days and be followed by technical conversations, before resumed at Second Stage. Little could be expected to be accomplished by single meeting of Chiefs of State.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should be informed West will not negotiate at summit under threat of peace treaty, Berlin, or recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> thinks West should demand <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> confirm status quo of Berlin and present East Zone arrangements for five years, so that problems can be calmly examined, and constructive negotiations take place.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> asked if German people would put up with status quo for another five years. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> replied in affirmative, saying it would be helpful if SovZoners could again freely visit <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>, and if pressures against two <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> churches were relaxed.</p>
<p>Chancellor asked whether <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had inquired into <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s position on summit meeting. Answer was French President not “averse”.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> now repeated to me what he regarded as capital. Agreement by US, UK and France to summit meeting with USSR must be predicated on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> paying price of five years extension status quo. Believed this realistic, because <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s strong desire conversations other Chiefs State.</p>
<p>Chancellor had told <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> illness greatly complicated matters. Unknowing when Secretary would become mobile, one cannot predict who might manage first stage summit negotiations for U.S. Since U.S. was leading power free world, summit conversations, without participation <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, would be dangerous.<note n="4" xml:id="d219fn4">This paragraph was not in telegram 2024.</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_481" n="481" facs="0506"/>
<p>Evident, according <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> thinks <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> conference has little significance and would probably serve only preparation agenda for Summit, and footling interchanges.</p>
<p>It will be to convey such impressions <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> will visit Ottawa and Washington.</p>
<p>For moment this seemed end of Chancellor’s comments, but after ponderation, he resumed conversation, saying the four Foreign Ministers must at end of month in Washington deliberate over answer to Soviet notes, and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> will advocate promise of Summit meeting.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is absolutely opposed to this tactic, for Soviets would immediately accept and pocket such concession, yielding nothing in return. That would be, in Chancellor’s estimation, a sale at too low a price.</p>
<p>Chancellor is conscious <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> meeting, in light <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s views, offers little prospect unless Summit follows. But Summit unsafe without strong U.S. leadership.</p>
<p>When Chancellor had presented these arguments to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, <gloss target="#t_IS1">PM</gloss> agreed to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> proposals: (1) Maintenance status quo for 5 years should be condition precedent to Summit; (2) Summit should take place in stages.</p>
<p>From time to time during exposition, I questioned Chancellor, but only answer of importance was that he had not discussed Summit possibilities with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. Evident he will quickly remedy this omission, but through what instrumentality or oddity God wot.<note n="5" xml:id="d219fn5">Middle English form of “knows.”</note> He formed during Paris visit favorable impression of <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debré</persName>, has invited him Bonn, but will probably not await his coming to try to line up <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.</p>
<p>Always with this whimsical old gentleman there is something juicy in reserve. He asked me whether I had any recent private news of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName>’s health, and if I thought it possible he might be at Camp David to supervise conversations between President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>. I answered I was without information on that subject. He said <persName corresp="#p_GH1">Globke</persName> had recently been told by unrevealed source President was thinking of making <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> Prime Minister so he could represent US at Summit conferences. Was that possible under US Constitution? I told him it was not, but, borrowing from Soviet example, I saw no reason why <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> should not, as had been done when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was hierarchally subordinate to Bulganin, participate in Summit conversations. This cheered him considerably.<note n="6" xml:id="d219fn6">This paragraph was not in telegram 2024.</note></p>
<p>As to place of possible Summit meeting, Chancellor is specifically against Moscow or London, and favors some location in US. He thinks <pb xml:id="pg_482" n="482" facs="0507"/><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would give much to see US, and would be impressed by its manifest vitality.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> requested that the substance of his talk with me be treated with greatest discretion, and certain undesignated parts of it be suppressed unless conveyed only to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
<p>I saw <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> this morning. He said <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had agreed we ought attempt obtain concessions from Soviets in return for agreement on Summit conference, but <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had not, at least in <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName>’s presence, committed himself on five year suggestion. Notes on meetings are in London, and Department will be informed from there what transpired. <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName>’s own view is insistence of five year standstill unrealistic, but feels proposals for more limited concessions deserve thorough study.</p>

<p>3354. Department pass Defense. From <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName>. Following are some general impressions as first week of Working Group session in Paris<note n="1" xml:id="d220fn1">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> draws to close:</p>
<p>1. British seem to be interested in maintaining maximum fluidity in Western positions limiting working group report largely to posing issues for later resolution. This presumably related to desire give <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> opportunity to push his ideas in all three capitals before committing themselves. Reaction of British Delegation to our elements paper<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">Reference is to “Elements of a Western Position at a Conference with the Soviets,” undated, which was tabled by the U.S. Delegation at the Four Power Working Group on March 12. The nine-page paper includes sections on Soviet intentions, Western objectives, Western tactics, and a Western offer on German reunification, European security, and Berlin. (Attached to a note from <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Calhoun</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_GBGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> dated March 17; <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, Staff Secretary Records)</note> as plan with public appeal has been generally favorable, but they obviously regard Berlin proposals which West prepared to make possibly <pb xml:id="pg_483" n="483" facs="0508"/>separate from general settlement as crux of problem and will want to keep Western position on these open. British apparently also wish to pose question of whether any security measure in Europe can be taken separate from political settlement. This attitude reflected in their unwillingness even to draft at this time agreed estimate of Soviet intentions which might precondition Western approach.</p>
<p>2. French are following conservative essentially negative line and for different reasons may be expected to end with British in supporting working group report main function of which will be to pose issues for later resolution. Traditional French attitudes on subject like disarmament features American paper continue to dominate. However, they have apparently not dropped idea of some special status for reunified Germany in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and may come up with some new formulation on this subject and a declaration on exclusion <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s from zone of limitations.</p>
<p>3. Other than revival of Fechter-Meissner reunification plan<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">The Fechter-Meissner proposal had been tabled by the German Delegation to the Working Group on German Unity in March of 1957. The revised proposal, presented by the German Delegation in Paris on March 10, called for the convening of an all-German committee to deal with the extension and coordination of contacts between the two parts of Germany. One year later an all-German Council would be elected to draft an election law for a national assembly that would draft a constitution for Germany. (Telegram 3289 from Paris, March 11; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/3–1159).</note> (portions of which adopted in American paper), Germans seem to have little to contribute. They had indicated that more may be expected when <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> comes from Bonn next week, hinting they have some proposals to advance in European security field but are reluctant to do so before they have some basis for estimating probable American reaction.</p>
<p>4. Tabling of American elements paper has had stimulating effect and plan for reunification and European security will undoubtedly appear in working group report, perhaps as major annex. However, for reasons indicated above, seems unlikely that report will have basic fourpart structure, as set forth paragraph one of American paper. Given circumstances, we do not consider this tragedy as long as important issues which can only be resolved at higher level are clearly indicated.</p>
<p>5. As to Western reply Soviet note of March 2, primary unresolved issues are formulation of agenda and language re summit meeting. As long as British remain tightly bound by present instructions from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> possibility of reaching any agreement by early next week seems remote. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_HPF1">Hancock</persName> personally prefers our language on agenda and probably on summit and can be counted on to make effective presentation French and our arguments against British formulations.</p>

<p>6. We have just learned from von Baudissin that Macmillan and Adenauer apparently reached agreement in Bonn that efforts to coordinate Western reply to Soviet note should cease until after Macmillan visit to Washington. This presumably means both German and British Delegations will be instructed to cease discussions this subject in working group.</p>

        <head>221. Letter from Acting Secretary of State Herter to the British Ambassador (Caccia)<note n="0" type="source" xml:id="d221fn0">Source: Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204. Secret. Drafter by Kohler and cleared with President Eisenhower at a meeting with Herter during the morning of March 14. (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, DDE Diaries)</note></head>
        <dateline><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1959-03-14">March 14, 1959</date></dateline>
        <p>DEAR HARROLD: I appreciated very much the promptness of your report of the Prime Minister's talks with Adenauer and brought your letter of March 13<note n="1" xml:id="d221fn1"><ref target="#d217">Document 217</ref></note> immediately to the attention of the President. He has asked me to let you know and to ask you to inform the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary of his concern about several aspects of this report.</p>
        <p>First of all, on the question of the proposed commitment to a definite date for the Summit Conference we feel strongly that if we give Khrushchev a date at this point the Foreign Ministers Conference would be condemned to sterility. On the other hand, if we indicated that as a minimum the Foreign Ministers meeting would have to reveal some prospects for serious some negotiations, then we would enhance the chances of getting something constructive out of the May meeting. Moreover, the policy which we consistently followed throughout the exhaustive exchanges of last year—that a Summit meeting could only be accepted if preparations give a real prospect for reaching agreement on significant subjects—is well-known to Moscow, as well as our own peoples. Recession from this position at this stage would risk getting a dangerous impression of weakness. Actually the President himself agrees that we should be relatively forthcoming on a reply as regards a <pb xml:id="pg_485" n="485" facs="0510"/> Summit Conference and personally proposed new formula which we have introduced into the working group in Paris as follows:</p>
        <p>Assuming that the Foreign Ministers meeting gives promise of progress at a Summit Conference, this Government would be happy to participate in such us a Summit Conference at any reasonable place and time.</p>
        <p>Supplementing this, we think it would be possible to allow our Ambassadors in Moscow to indicate to the Soviets that a Summit Conference might be contemplated next summer provided there was satisfactory progress at the Foreign Ministers Conference. Under the natural assumption that the Conference were held outside United States, it should be borne in mind that our constitutional system for severe limits on the time the President can be continuously out of the country.  This is possible for only a few days.</p>
        <p>Our own basic estimate is that we see less dangerous than you apparently do with the Russians taking precipitate action with respect to access or the threatened conclusion of a separate peace treaty with East Germany. In fact we did receive the impression from reports that Prime Minister's talks with Khrushchev that you felt the danger of precipitate unilateral action by the Russians had lessened.</p>
        <p>As you know, our formulation of the agenda item was taken deliberately from the communiqué including the Prime Minister's talks in Moscow with Mr. Khrushchev and hence represents a formulation to which the Russians have publicly subscribed. We think it would be difficult for them to turn this down.  Of course, the French think that we should be even more specific and the problem might be met by adding a sentence and our note to the effect that: "Naturally any of the four participating governments should have the opportunity to raise for discussion any question which it may consider relevant to the problems under consideration. This seems close to be approach suggested in the British text tabled in Paris.<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">The text of the British draft was transmitted in telegram 3330 from Paris, March 13. (Department of State, Central Files 396.1/3–1359)</note> Except for the question of fixing a date for the Summit Conference we had had the impression from your letter of March 9 and from reports of our representative on the Working Group in Paris that there was in fact little substantial difference in the views of the four Governments on the content of our reply to the latest Soviet note. Frankly, we <pb xml:id="pg_486" n="486" facs="0511"/> had hoped that it would be possible for the Working Group to finish coordinating the replies this week so that they could be delivered to Moscow even before the Prime Minister’s arrival here. It had seemed to us that this might produce some useful reactions from Moscow which the President and Prime Minister could take into account in their talks. We recognize that this time schedule may no longer be possible. However, we still think that the Working Group should get on with the job without delay and that if the matter of commitment to a specific date for a Summit Conference were dropped, there should be no difficulty in prompt agreement. We hope you will agree to this.</p>
<p>I am informing the German Chargé here regarding the substance of this letter and asking him to pass our views along to Bonn.</p>

<p>The Secretary discussed with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> on Saturday afternoon<note n="1" xml:id="d222fn1">March 14.</note> the U.S. posture vis-à-vis a Summit meeting. He said that he had expressed to the President the previous afternoon<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">The President visited <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> from 2:45 to 3:13 p.m. on March 13. (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, President’s Daily Appointments Book)</note> the thought that it is dangerous to gamble on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, even at a Summit meeting, agreeing to anything that we could safely accept, and sticking to it. The Secretary said he had not been able to think of any matter on which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be prepared to deal reliably with us; he had recalled to the President the Soviet perfidy following the 1955 Summit meeting, when the Soviets had made an arrangement with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss><note n="3" xml:id="d222fn3">Regarding Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> agreements signed at Moscow On September 20, 1955, see <ref target="frus1955-57v26"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, vol. XXVI</ref>, pp. 537–538.</note> <pb xml:id="pg_487" n="487" facs="0512"/>even before the Foreign Ministers met, which arrangement effectively precluded the possibility of the Foreign Ministers carrying out the directive of the Heads of Government on German reunification. The Secretary thought that if we do get to a Summit meeting we might ask <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at the outset whether he is now prepared to stand by the 1955 agreement,<note n="4" xml:id="d222fn4">For text of the Heads of Government directive to their Foreign Ministers, July 23, 1955, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., vol. V, pp. 527–528.</note> and point out that unless he is so prepared there is no point in seeking to negotiate any further agreement.</p>
<p>The Secretary had also expressed to the President the thought that another danger of getting to the Summit is that public pressure will be very great for some kind of “agreement” however illusory. He thought it might be worth trying to find out through the Diplomatic channel, if not at a Foreign Ministers meeting, whether there is any prospect of positive accomplishment at the Summit, before we agree to go there. It might also be worth considering having the Foreign Ministers and their Deputies discuss the German problem at length, as the Deputies discussed the Austrian problem. In this connection, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> reported <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s idea of a five year moratorium in return for a Summit meeting (Bonn telegram 2024).<note n="5" xml:id="d222fn5">See <ref target="#d219fn1">footnote 1, Document 219</ref>.</note></p>
<p>The Secretary said that as far as the British are concerned he has no objection to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> getting whatever political advantage he can at home out of the form of a “leadership” of the West, as long as we continue to control the substance of the Western position.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he had also told the President he thought it undesirable to let the public think that we are on the verge of war over Berlin: we are not, and if people think we are they will want the leaders to pull back from the determined positions that are essential to preserving peace. The United States has ample physical power to deter the Soviets from starting a war and must have the will and steadiness and skill to use this asset effectively. As to Berlin, our position is legally and morally unassailable, so we need not give up any of it to the Soviets except as we may get a broader settlement which meets the aspirations of the German people and the requirements of security in Europe.</p>

<p>3389. Ref: <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3357.<note n="1" xml:id="d223fn1">Telegram 3357 is not printed.</note> Following is text of message from President to President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, replying to latter’s letter of March 12, for delivery soonest. Advise date and time delivery.</p>
<p>“March 14, 1959. Dear General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>: I have received and read with great care your letter of March 12<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2"><ref target="#d215">Document 215</ref>.</note> and wish to reply immediately to express my gratification at having this expression of your views.</p>
<p>Your analysis of the artificial crisis precipitated by the announced intentions of the Soviets to change the status of Berlin, and the existing arrangements for our access to Berlin seems to me to sum up the situation admirably. More than two million people in West Berlin look to us for the protection of their continued safety and welfare. We could not think of risking our honor by accepting, under the threat of force, conditions which would undermine our ability to fulfill our commitment to the people of Berlin. Our rights are clear. I share your view that if force is used to oppose our exercise of these rights, the world will know precisely who in this controversy first resorted to force to settle a dispute. The more we and you and our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies are firm and united, the less chance it seems to me that we shall run the risk of dangerous Soviet counteraction.</p>
<p>As you say, there is every reason to convoke a conference of Foreign Ministers, and to let such a conference run on while both sides exhaustively canvass possibilities for solution. We should not commit ourselves to go to a “summit” conference until there was some promise that such a conference could, in fact, yield satisfying results. I am communicating these same considerations, which appear of major political importance to me, to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d223fn3">No direct communication between the President and the Prime Minister along these lines has been found, but <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> may have been referring to <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s message to <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName>, <ref target="#d221">Document 221</ref>.</note></p>
<p>The reunification of Germany would effectively remove from Central Europe the main cause of tension there. Other important political consequences, which we would all welcome, would undoubtedly follow in its train. This happy event, as you suggest, is not likely to occur very soon, and I agree entirely that in the interim contacts between the <pb xml:id="pg_489" n="489" facs="0514"/>two parts of Germany should be encouraged. I would here only enter a note of caution, with which I am sure you would agree, that, for many reasons, contacts which risk enhancing the position and prestige of the Soviet puppet government should be minimized.</p>
<p>In discussing the Berlin crisis and the difficult situation in Germany, the vital importance of the continued strength and unity of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance inevitably also comes to my mind. I am sure you will of course agree that our common defenses must be maintained at maximum effectiveness if we are to deal with the Soviets with the firmness which both you and I desire. I believe we should proceed on this score calmly and purposefully. We should not take hasty measures designed superficially to build up our defenses which would only be interpreted as a sign of fear on our part, nor should we do anything to weaken our defenses, or make moves which could be interpreted as weakness or lack of determination. In addition to maintaining our military strength, we must also maintain a spirit of common political purpose among all members of the Alliance. Otherwise we will increase our vulnerability to Soviet efforts to divide us. Everything possible should be done to ensure that the military strength and political unity of the Alliance are maintained.</p>
<p>With reference to another portion of your letter, I am gratified to note that your views on the subject of “disengagement” are very close to my own. We have, as you know, felt that a technical approach to the problem of surprise attack, with measures not confined to a narrow or limited area, would be a worthwhile next step in the disarmament field. Unfortunately, the conference with the Soviets on this matter at Geneva last fall made it clear that their approach to the problem was completely unacceptable. The Soviet proposals would have led to the creation of a narrow demilitarized zone in Central Europe without any real assurance that the danger of surprise attack would be reduced. I continue to hope, of course, that it will be possible to make progress in the disarmament field, but I fully agree with you that we cannot accept measures which would jeopardize our basic security interests.</p>
<p>I also wished to refer briefly to our previous correspondence regarding a closer tripartite relationship among France, Great Britain and ourselves: I believe, as you expressed last month to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in Paris, that these talks have already begun to serve a useful purpose. We, for our part, are disposed to continue these talks, and I am gratified that a date has been set early next month for the next meetings in this series.<note n="4" xml:id="d223fn4">Regarding the tripartite talks on Africa, held in Washington April 16–21, see vol. VII, Part 2, <ref target="#d107">Document 107</ref>.</note></p>

<p>2. Vaucelles (France) said his present instructions did not permit him to participate in such discussions. French government’s sole idea with respect to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was to keep it completely out of Berlin problem.</p>
<p>3. French attitude about relationship of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to Berlin situation is not only negative; it is unrealistic in extreme. Failure to consider ways in which <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could play role in Berlin could have extremely grave consequences. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> may be one of best ways out of Berlin crisis and is in any event sure to be involved. All of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> implications and subtleties should be analyzed by those having greatest experience in this field.</p>
<p>4. We should begin considering all possibilities of kind <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dixon</persName> suggests and any others Department may have in mind promptly, preferably with all three delegates, but we should not await the French. <gloss target="#t_UKDel1">UKDel</gloss> wishes meet with USDel regardless.</p>

<head>225. Editorial Note</head>
<p>On March 16 at 9:30 p.m. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> addressed the American people on the subjects of Berlin and national defense posture. In the first part of his address the President reviewed the background of the Berlin crisis and defined the United States position on the city and on negotiations concerning it. He concluded by stating:</p>
<list><item>“Our position, then, is this: We will not retreat one inch from our duty. We shall continue to exercise our right of peaceful passage to and <pb xml:id="pg_492" n="492" facs="0517"/>from West Berlin. We will not be the first to breach the peace; it is the Soviets who threaten the use of force to interfere with such free passage. We are ready to participate fully in every sincere effort at negotiation that will respect the existing rights of all and their opportunity to live in peace.”

<item>Major <persName corresp="#p_EMJSD1">Eisenhower</persName></item>
</list>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> explained the reason for his requesting this meeting: to summarize for the President matters which Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> might bring up on his forthcoming visit.</p>
<p>Before addressing the briefing book,<note n="1" xml:id="d226fn1">No briefing book as such has been found, however, briefing papers on the various topics that might be raised during <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s visit are <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., International File and in the Staff Secretary Records.</note> the President remarked about his surprise this morning, in reading the newspapers, to see that his speech<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">See <ref target="#d225">Document 225</ref>.</note> of the night before had been interpreted as agreeing to a summit meeting. As a related issue, the President expressed perplexity over the inconsistent reports which he receives from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> on the one hand and from <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> on the other with regard to the conclusions being reached in high-level talks in Paris and Bonn. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed that the reports coming from the British, French and Germans had been inconsistent.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_493" n="493" facs="0518"/>
<p>The President then went on to describe <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s stated view that summit talks should be routine affairs rather than one-time operations. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> believes there should be a series of such meetings. The President remarked at the readiness of people to tell the President of the United States to chase all over the world.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then touched on the matter of contingency planning. He expected that in the meeting to be held later in the day this matter would be clarified.<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">See <ref target="#d228">Document 228</ref>.</note> He expressed the hope that our current plans would undergo minimum change. We are currently receiving reports from overseas as to the exact details of what is going on. State is satisfied with the instructions as they stand, but Defense desires more precision.</p>
<p>The President mentioned the question posed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> as to the possible use of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> answered that we recommend going to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> immediately if the Soviets turn down the reply which we are preparing for transmission within the next few days.</p>
<p>The President then turned to the question of stamping of identification papers. He admitted that if he were to place himself in the situation of the Soviets, he could see flaws in the U.S. position. We recognize the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, whereas the USSR recognizes the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. If a final peace treaty between the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">USSR?</hi>] and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> specifies that:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) there will be no interference with authorized traffic to and from Berlin, and</item>
<item>(2) that stamping identification papers will merely verify this identification,</item>
</list>
<p>then it is difficult for us to argue with them. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> could take the position that this identification is necessary for a checkpoint in Berlin to ascertain that a convoy did in fact originate in the Western zone. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> agreed that the real issue is whether the Communists actually restrict our traffic. The President observed, however, that the USSR has stated that we must leave Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> added that stamping of papers might be considered the “thin edge of a wedge.”</p>
<p>The President asked whether a treaty between the USSR and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be considered valid if there were no Berlin problem. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> admitted that we would argue with such a treaty only when it cuts across our rights.</p>
<p>The President then considered an additional complication. Even if the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> were to pledge themselves to carry out the responsibilities heretofore exercised by the Soviets, we could not, even though tempted to accept, give it consideration, because it would be death to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_494" n="494" facs="0519"/>
<p>The President then expressed the opinion that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> may be making a serious mistake even in the context of his narrow domestic political viewpoint. The main weakness of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s reported position consists in accepting a summit meeting without receiving any quid pro quo. It would appear that the British public would finally ask how long Britain needs to be slapped in the face. [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph</hi> (<hi rend="italic">7–1/2 lines of source text</hi>) <hi rend="italic">not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p>In connection with the subject of German reunification, the President-remarked that we seem to be fighting with pillows. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is now talking as if the first step toward unification might be a federation. The President asked what we currently mean by the term “reunification.” At Geneva we had specified that reunification must come about as the result of free elections. Here we appear to be considering the prospect of a federation, that is, anything to enable us to include all of Germany in a peace treaty. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> answered that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is extremely leery of the idea of a federation, and the paper which is being worked on in the State Department includes many steps toward eventual reunification. (The President recalled that the process is expected to take three years.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> then stated that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s fears are of the concept of equality. He does not wish the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to be given a veto over the actions of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. A possible solution to this would be the concept of a Council of German States. This would avoid the actual governments of East and West Germany becoming involved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> added that the Germans are busy working on all sorts of ideas for unification below the federation level.</p>
<p>The President then referred to our metaphor of “walking a rickety fence.” Here it would appear that we are walking two fences in different directions. In particular, he had in mind the difficulties in backing both <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and the British, whose views appear to be diametrically opposed. The President noted in the briefing book that Britain would just as soon see Germany remain divided. He pointed out, however, that the Germans are one people and the desire on their part to reunite is strong indeed.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then pointed out the difficulties within Germany itself. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> and Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> are hardly on speaking terms. Berlin is a hotbed of Social Democrats, and party politics within Germany are highly competitive. He pointed out further that areas such as Saxony and Thuringia are strongholds of the Social Democrats. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> feels that his party would be thrown out if reunification came about tomorrow.</p>
<p>The President turned to the subject of how to ensure that the West German viewpoint is represented in a “summit” meeting. At the Geneva conference of 1955, we had set up a pipeline to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. In any <pb xml:id="pg_495" n="495" facs="0520"/>further conference, however, the views of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> would be so important to the Western delegations that it would be necessary to keep him in the next room. With <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> close at hand, we would have to face the criticism in our own press that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is a stumbling block for us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out that during the Geneva negotiations <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had come to a summer home near the city, where he was readily accessible.<note n="4" xml:id="d226fn4">At a second conference on March 19 <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> again reviewed the British and U.S. positions on a Foreign Ministers meeting and a Summit conference.

<p>1. Although over 3 months have passed since the Russian ultimatum, the Governments of the United States, United Kingdom and France have not yet made provisions for tripartite military planning to cover possible developments of the Berlin crisis nor provided for a tripartite military command should such an establishment be required. Dept–Bonn 1865 dtd 18 Feb 59 (ref A) proposed with Defense concurrence that <pb xml:id="pg_496" n="496" facs="0521"/>three unspecified military headquarters in Germany should “plan and coordinate quiet preparatory and precautionary military measure” since each of the three countries have two co-equal <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss>s in Germany, Army and Air Force, each vitally interested in this subject. The proposed planning group would consist of representatives of at least six commands, and to this I would feel that Navy representation would also have to be added.</p>
<p>2. Dept-Paris 3249 dated 6 Mar 59 (ref B), again with Defense concurrence, makes what appears to be a new proposal, and adds to this proposed planning group the three embassies at Bonn. As far as is known to me, there has been no coordination with the British and the French, and certainly no agreement. In spite of these proposals, I assume there is no question in the minds of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, as there is none in mine, that if trouble starts the whole military problem, whether on a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or national basis, falls squarely into my lap.</p>
<p>3. As stated in the course of my meeting with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> in early Feb,<note n="2" xml:id="d227fn2">No record of this meeting has been found.</note> I consider it essential to set up without further delay a tripartite military staff, operating under Deputy <gloss target="#t_CINCEUR1">CINCEUR</gloss> acting for me, to deal with the planning for tripartite military questions arising out of the Berlin situation, including those envisaged in par 1 of ref A, and the military aspects of Dept–Bonn G–397, dated 19 Feb 59 (ref C), except the last paragraph, in which case my ER 9–10438, dated 15 Mar 59 (ref D) applies. In due time also, a tripartite commander should be designated to take over the responsibility for the direction of the staff and for such subsequent operational activities as the situation may require. As reported in <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> 9–10240, dtd 23 Feb 59 (ref E), I have established a U.S. nucleus for a tripartite staff on 18 Feb, and on 19 Feb I approached <persName corresp="#p_RSF1">Sir Frank Roberts</persName> on the subject of British participation. As reported in Paris–<gloss target="#t_SecState1">SecState</gloss> 3200, dtd 4 Mar 59 (ref F), <persName corresp="#p_RSF1">Roberts</persName> informed me on 3 Mar that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>, after discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, had given the informal and personal response that the British thought it was a good idea and would be pleased to participate. This was confirmed by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> when I talked to him on Monday, 9 Mar. As reported in Paris–<gloss target="#t_SecState1">SecState</gloss> 3295 dtd 11 Mar 59 (ref G), I opened the subject with Gen Ely on that date. Ely was personally favorable and thought it important to initiate tripartite planning quickly. This morning he advised me that the French Govt should now be approached formally since they were in broad agreement with the proposal.</p>
<p>4. Having gone so far informally, this activity should now be formalized. The question was asked in Paris-<gloss target="#t_SecState1">SecState</gloss> 3200 (ref F) whether this activity should be formalized by authorizing me to deal with the <pb xml:id="pg_497" n="497" facs="0522"/>U.K. and French Permanent <gloss target="#t_rep1">Rep</gloss>s, or if other channels should be used. This question has not been answered.</p>
<p>5. I visualize a very small tripartite staff of perhaps 20 officers and the same number of clerks, etc. It would function strictly as a staff of the military commander. It would be essential to have qualified technical experts on liaison duty from the several air and ground headquarters in Germany, and liaison agents from the <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>’s of the U.K. and France would be necessary. It would also be essential that the staff maintain the very closest possible liaison with <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> and with whatever political authorities may be designated by the British and the French respectively, since the staff would have to depend upon them for direct political guidance and advice. We also contemplate some German participation, at least for coordination purposes.</p>
<p>6. It is proposed to keep this tripartite staff concealed initially under a cover that it is “planning the common use of military facilities.” The code name for this activity is “Live Oak,” which will be used in all messages bearing on this subject. Space and other facilities have been prepared at Camp des Loges.</p>
<p>7. Although I can make direct official representations to the French and U.K. Govts thru their Perm <gloss target="#t_rep1">Rep</gloss>s, <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>’s or Chiefs of Staff, it is my judgment that the way to establish this agency on the soundest and best basis is by official U.S. Govt representation thru the respective embassies. I would, however, sacrifice what may appear theoretically to be the best approach in the interest of immediate action, should that be necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> handed the President a memorandum relating to contingency planning.<note n="1" xml:id="d228fn1"><ref target="#d229">Document 229</ref>.</note> The President asked a number of questions to clarify and sharpen up the significance of some of the points made, for example on the question of flying above 10,000 feet, and on the question of “stamping” documents. The President said that he understood the difficulty of stamping is really Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>—that he would be inclined to agree with Defense’s de-emphasis on stamping except for <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s position.</p>
<p>The President then asked questions regarding the proposal for the use of force locally. Answers were not completely clear as to the significance of the term “local.”</p>
<p>The President also asked regarding the possibility of a program of reprisals such as stopping trading and breaking relations. The key point here is the extent to which our allies would stand with us in this matter. Again the answers were not completely clear, although State representatives indicated that these questions are receiving consideration.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> mentioned the suggestions that have been made for “heckling” operations such as blockade. The President said we should not go into blockade until we have had such provocation that this would be reprisal rather than pressure.</p>
<p>The President next indicated he had a question as to the arming of the first convoy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> indicated the purpose of this is to put the onus on the other side to make the first use of force.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> said that the men in the convoy always have side arms. He stressed the need for more factual information as to just what the situation is at the check points. He said it would be planned to send photographic equipment along with the convoy to provide a record of <pb xml:id="pg_499" n="499" facs="0524"/>just what happened. The President asked whether members of the press would be sent in. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> thought they might, in correspondents’ uniforms.</p>
<p>With regard to the suggestions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> said he has opposed sending a 7,000 man increase in strength to Europe. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s chief purpose is to stop the cutback now going on in certain support units. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> said he is inclined to think this is a step to have in mind to do when we want to gain some special effect. The President recalled that his thought was that if we keep extra personnel in Europe, we should not ask the Army to make compensatory cuts elsewhere.</p>
<p>The President next noted the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommendation for compensatory replacement for any <gloss target="#t_USAREUR1">USAREUR</gloss> divisions moved up to North Germany to form a composite force, and returned to his question as to what was meant by “local action.” General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said it was of the order of one division reinforced, having in mind that if the job can’t be done with a force of this size we had better shift to some other mode of action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> confirmed that when we do that the “fat is in the fire.”</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> next raised the question of concessions for the sake of unity. The President said that negotiation always implies some flexibility. It is not possible to specify the extent to which we will modify in general terms. Some things can be modified but some cannot.</p>
<p>The President next asked when we will make moves that would be visible, for example the removal of dependents. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that would come the minute we are blocked. There was some doubt as to whether dependents could get out in those circumstances. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> said we have assumed that civilian travel would continue. The President asked that a reference to “political negotiations having failed” be changed to something like “political negotiations having failed to resolve the situation.”</p>
<p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> to be ready to review this contingency planning with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, having additional people present for the discussion as might be required.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Berlin Contingency Planning</item>
</list>
<p>1. You asked recently to be brought up to date on Berlin contingency planning.</p>
<p>2. Berlin contingency planning has proceeded on the basis of guidance which you approved at a meeting on January 29, 1959,<note n="1" xml:id="d229fn1">See <ref target="#d149">Document 149</ref>.</note> with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">Tab A is airgram G–397, printed as <ref target="#d181">Document 181</ref>.</note></p>
<p>3. In order to obtain full understanding of the access control question, a joint State–Defense team of officials acquainted with current contingency planning will proceed promptly to Germany to make first-hand observations of current Soviet practice concerning access.</p>
<p>4. The following steps are now recommended for your approval:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) At an appropriate time before May 27, test flights should be made in and out of Berlin above 10,000 feet. The Soviets have denied that we have a right to fly above that ceiling. We have maintained that we do have such a right, but have never in fact exercised it.</item>
<item>(b) Present contingency planning provides that after the attempted or announced substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for USSR, the first unit to go through would be a truck or trucks accompanied by a scout car or some other vehicle with a capability for shooting. We recommend that this concept be changed, and that the first unit to attempt passage in such circumstances should be a routine convoy to emphasize our intention to continue past practices. If this unit is blocked, we recommend that the next unit should be accompanied by a scout car or similar vehicle. Its purpose would be to establish the existence of forcible blockage.<note n="3" xml:id="d229fn3">Next to the last two sentences in the source text is the handwritten note “Doubtful as to this. C.A.H.”</note></item>
<item>(c) We recommend that you ask the Departments of State and Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to prepare for you on an urgent basis an analysis of the political and military implications of the four alternative courses of action with respect to the use of force, discussed in paragraph 7 below. We suggest a deadline of April 7. You may recall that a similar study proved useful in connection with the Korean War (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 147 of April 2, 1953).<note n="4" xml:id="d229fn4">For text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v15p1"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol.

<p>6. <hi rend="italic">Substitution.</hi> The doctrine that we will allow “no substitution” of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for Soviet personnel (at least unless there is an acknowledged agency relation between the two) is being questioned in various quarters—both foreign and domestic. Attention is focusing on the “no stamping” application of the “no substitution” doctrine, i.e., the proposition that we will refuse to allow paper stamping as a means of identifying allied military traffic to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel since this would imply acceptance of control.</p>
<p>[<hi rend="italic">4 paragraphs (17 lines of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p>7. <hi rend="italic">Alternative uses of force.</hi></p>
<list>
<item>(a) Recent discussions between State and Defense officials confirmed agreement that we should be prepared to resort to force if necessary to maintain access to Berlin—even at the risk of general war.</item>
<item>(b) Four alternative uses of force, in the event of failure of political negotiations, have been discussed:
<list>
<item>(i) A substantial effort to reopen ground access by local action.</item>
<item>(ii) A substantial effort to reopen air access, if blocked.</item>
<item>(iii) Reprisals against the communists in other areas, e.g., Western naval controls on bloc shipping.</item>
<item>(iv) General war measures.</item>
</list></item>
<item>(c) In paragraph 4 (c) above, we recommended that you direct preparation of an analysis of the implications of these alternative courses of action on an urgent basis.</item>
</list>
<p>8. <hi rend="italic">Timing of force.</hi> It may be difficult to maintain a state of high military readiness over a long period. On the other hand, there would be political difficulties in breaking off negotiations, or a debate in the United Nations, and resorting to force, especially if civilian traffic to Berlin was still moving freely.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_502" n="502" facs="0527"/>
<p>If political negotiations prove prolonged, at what point should we be prepared to resort to one of the four alternative uses of forces described above? The answer to this question will, of course, hinge in considerable measure on your decision after the completion of the study recommended in paragraph 4 (c).</p>

<p>782. Re: Berlin; <gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss> 776.<note n="1" xml:id="d230fn1">See <ref target="#d224fn1">footnote 1, Document 224</ref>.</note></p>
<p>1. My chief impressions emerging from exchange of views reported by paraphrase in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> are as follows:</p>
<p>A. All three dels agree there should be no recourse to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> prior four power negots despite risk involved this may later permit Soviets seize initiative.</p>
<p>B. Basis for this agreement is US-UK view that no matter how we might view such recourse, Soviets could successfully portray it as our attempt obstruct negotiated settlement. French agree not for this reason but because up to now their only concern is that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> be kept totally out of picture until after three powers have reacted on ground to physical interference with our access to Berlin.</p>
<p>C. My personal belief continues to be contrary to statement in Department’s 747<note n="2" xml:id="d230fn2">Dated March 12. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/3–959)</note> that a démarche in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would necessarily give Soviets chance in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to circumvent <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> meeting. Realistic management should be able prevent this, particularly as <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> is a forum where we have such an advantage. Nor do I agree that such a démarche, if it were linked to US <pb xml:id="pg_503" n="503" facs="0528"/>willingness to attend a summit meeting as this was expounded by the President last Monday night,<note n="3" xml:id="d230fn3">See <ref target="#d225">Document 225</ref>.</note> could inevitably be successfully portrayed as an attempt to obstruct settlement.</p>
<p>D. We and British agree there is strong probability that mere transfer of Soviet rights to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would result quickly in introduction of new situation into <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, either by Soviets or some other party, and that under these circumstances we would be subjected to strong diplomatic pressures to accept new status quo.</p>
<p>E. We and British agree there is slight likelihood Soviets would transfer rights during course of <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s negots but strong likelihood they may do this if they view negots as unsatisfactory. Likelihood would increase if Soviets believed we were not willing go to summit.</p>
<p>F. With this in mind we and British see strong advantage if we seize initiative at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> (in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>) before Soviets have chance to change status quo by transferring rights. Our main purpose would be to seize <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> of present situation and build pressure against any unilateral Soviet move to alter it while at same time preserving our ability to respond to any alteration and calling for renewed negots.</p>
<p>G. In support of such initiative we and British believe we should have some substantive proposal we could point to which on the face of it would appear to offer basis for negotiated settlement—at least of those problems resulting from Soviet attempts deny our rights in Berlin and access thereto. We also agree this would lead to renewed pressures for further negots at summit level.</p>
<p>H. We and British agree on need for further study here of (1) possible uses of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery which might be included in three-power substantive proposals to Soviets during negots, and (2) possible diplomatic uses of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to support three-power position.</p>
<p>I. As reported <gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss> 767,<note n="4" xml:id="d230fn4"><ref target="#d224">Document 224</ref>.</note> French thinking has not evolved this far and further tripartite exchanges here are stymied.</p>

<p>1. I indicated to the President that I wished to talk about Berlin and Germany. First, I wanted to follow up on the Tuesday (March 17) meeting. I reminded the President that the background for this meeting was really the Special <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Meeting of 5 March, which he had requested, to discuss Berlin and Germany. I said that in my judgment the Special Meeting had not been satisfactory because of inadequate staffing and because the discussion did not follow the agenda which had been prepared for the meeting. Subsequent to the meeting I had talked with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, both of whom agreed that we needed more preparation in advance of another meeting with the President, to be attended by representatives of State and Defense and <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName>. The first such meeting had been held on Monday, 9 March; the second briefly on the 12th; and the third, and a very successful one, on the 14th. At that time I had agreed that State and Defense would draft the agenda for the meeting. However, the agenda did not come to me until about a half hour before the meeting and then it was in the form of a memorandum to the President.</p>
<p>I expressed to the President my view that the memorandum advanced the ball considerably but was inadequate in that it did not cover many contingencies which should have been presented and in it the assumptions were not clearly stated. I further expressed the view that neither State nor Defense representatives were too well prepared to discuss the memorandum which both Departments had signed.</p>
<p>I then raised this question with the President: Would it be desirable to have <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName> assume a role in such meetings similar to that in National Security Council meetings in order to make sure all points were covered and all differences of view were expressed. The President felt that this would be desirable.</p>
<p>Next, I indicated to the President that there seemed to me to be four major phases of Berlin and Germany which should now be discussed. The first was immediate negotiation with our allies, that is to say; the impending conference with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>. I indicated to the President that I did not believe this to be a matter in which I would be involved and I had no suggestions, realizing that he was in every way fully prepared for the conference.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_505" n="505" facs="0530"/>
<p>I said, however, that I did wish to discuss the other three phases. The first of these was contingency planning, and particularly the specifics of U.S. actions. I asked the President whether he wished me to continue to follow this and make certain that adequate staff work was accomplished in view of his repeatedly expressed concern about being sure we knew what we would do in various contingencies. I offered the view that I was not sure that State–Defense coordination was sufficient without the addition of staff work on behalf of the President, especially in light of the experience of the March 17 meeting.<note n="1" xml:id="d231fn1">See <ref target="#d228">Document 228</ref>.</note> The President felt that he wanted me to undertake such a role.</p>
<p>As examples of matters which need to be considered I gave the following:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) The importance of the dispatch of teams to Europe to examine what actually occurs at the check points. I pointed out to the President that in all the meetings he had had on this subject there had been no one in the room in any case who in recent years had observed the procedure on the ground. I pointed out to him that pending the report of the team, many decisions were stymied.</item>
<item>(b) The question of referring credentials to the International Court of Justice.</item>
<item>(c) The question of having Western guards replace East German guards.</item>
<item>(d) The question of the assumption by the United Nations of the identification function.</item>
<item>(e) What constitutes K–Day.</item>
<item>(f) What is meant by “forceable obstruction.”</item>
<item>(g) Can we make a distinction between identification and stamping.</item>
<item>(h) The question of recourse to the United Nations—what, how and when.</item>
<item>(i) The question of diplomatic rupture.</item>
<item>(j) The question of trade impact on the Soviet Bloc following diplomatic rupture. (k) Blockade.</item>
<item>(l) The question of whether we would consider a probe if negotiations were in progress but deadlocked, such as in the Geneva Conference on Discontinuance of Nuclear Testing.</item>
</list>
<p>The second phase involved the study and analysis of alternative uses of force by State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> which had been approved by the President on 17 March. I said that I believed that the President had on 17 March approved the notion of having this report made to a Special Meeting of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> but that I wished to make sure that there was advance preparation of the principal members of the Council before the <pb xml:id="pg_506" n="506" facs="0531"/>report was actually presented and wished to communicate the desirability of this procedure to the principals. The President agreed.</p>
<p>The final phase involved Germany as a whole. I pointed out to the President that the working group which is now in Paris would be finishing their work this weekend. They have been using a talking paper which of course was ad referendum but which contained all sorts of national security policy issues such as disarmament measures, neutral zone, etc. I pointed out to the President that there would be a Three-power Foreign Ministers Meeting (US–UK–France) probably on March 31, or April 1, and also probably a four-power Foreign Ministers Meeting (US–UK–France–Germany) at the same time. The purpose of these meetings has been stated to give general guidance with respect to governmental positions on the whole German problem. Furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting would take place April 2 to April 4.</p>
<p>I then said to the President that the big question was this: At what point do the document and the positions covered by the document cease to be a talking paper and become the beginning of a U.S. position. I indicated that it was not clear that a U.S. position must be firm before the end of this month but the time was coming when matters would have to be presented to the President for his final decision.</p>
<p>I raised with him the question of whether a report of progress of the working group and the State Department estimate relating thereto, should not be given to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on March 26 or a Special Meeting of the Council at about that time. I suggested that the purpose of this meeting would not be to arrive at final decisions but to identify those problems with respect to which Presidential decision would be required and also with respect to which differences of view existed within Executive Departments.</p>
<p>The President thought well of this and suggested that a presentation be made visually, that is to say, by the use of charts. He felt that the various steps in the process leading to a German settlement could be visually presented and those checked off with respect to which decisions had already been taken or could easily be taken and others could be flagged for serious consideration.</p>

<p>I said to the President that I assumed there would be three major points of possible disagreement or differences of emphasis between the British and ourselves: Whether to agree now to a Summit conference; whether to accept the principle of the Rapacki Plan; and what to do about the testing negotiations. I said that I would like to present briefly my own views on these points to be sure they coincided with those of the President and that he would therefore be agreeable to my presenting them to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> tomorrow:</p>
<p>As to the Summit meeting, I recalled that we had in May 1955 agreed to a Summit meeting after the urging of the British Government that this was for them a political necessity. But also we had agreed to it not just on this account but because in a sense the Soviets had paid the price which the President had been demanding as proof of willingness to do something for peace in terms of deeds as against mere words. They had agreed to and signed the Austrian State Treaty which was the one point which the United States had most strongly emphasized as necessary to demonstrate Soviet honorable intentions. Also at that time the Soviets had accepted without question our concept as to the character and composition of the meeting. At the present time the Soviets were trying to bring about a Summit meeting not through good behavior but by coercing us with threats and with violations of our established rights. Furthermore, there were strong indications that they would seek as part of such a meeting to establish the so-called principle of “parity” which would have for them very considerable political advantages and for us very considerable political embarrassments. It seemed to me that it was of the utmost importance to the integrity of our position not to give in to the kind of pressures to which we were now subjected, but to continue to take the position which heretofore we have consistently taken that there must be a prospect of some useful positive result out of a Summit meeting before we agree it should be held. This was the more true because the agreements of the last Summit meeting had almost immediately been repudiated by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The President indicated he was in full accord with this view. He had at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s request somewhat diluted his phraseology in his Monday night speech but he recalled that he had instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> <pb xml:id="pg_508" n="508" facs="0533"/>to tell the British Ambassador that the President assumed that the “developments” that he referred to would be “favorable” developments. The President was firmly of the opinion that we should not at this time agree to a Summit meeting.</p>
<p>With respect to the Rapacki Plan or some “thinning out” proposal, I recalled that I had pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in London<note n="1" xml:id="d232fn1">See <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note> that from a political standpoint some thinning out seemed to me acceptable provided that it did not involve discrimination in terms of any particular country and provided it did not involve rejection of the principle of collective security and of the right of one country to send its troops onto the soil of another at its request for self-defense. As to the military aspects, I had no judgment. I did however have in mind that it so happened in the case of the Western Allies that our principal strength was in the forward positions where were the forces of the Germans, the British and ourselves and that there was no very good alternative position in Europe to which these could be shifted. In view of General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s attitude, I did not think we would want, and I doubted whether he would be willing, that more American troops should be stationed in France. Therefore the thinning would dislodge the main body of our strength and dislodge it very seriously, whereas in the case of the Soviets this was not the case because they could put their troops anywhere in the area they dominated.</p>
<p>The President indicated general agreement with this point of view although he pointed out that there might possibly be some advantages in the thinning out program which involved inspections and controls of the kind we had been trying to get in various aspects of our disarmament talks.</p>
<p>I then referred to the nuclear testing negotiations.<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2">Documentation on the nuclear testing negotiations at Geneva is scheduled for publication in volume III.</note> I said it seemed to me quite clear by now that the Soviet Union would never accept within its national borders a genuinely independent group of inspectors with mobility and independence of action. Therefore I suggested that we should call off the present negotiations or at least shift their character by stating that the Soviet position on controls made the original project wholly unrealistic but that the United States would be willing to initiate a suspension of atmospheric testings in the hope and expectation that the Soviet Union would do the same. It might in this connection be possible to have some international posts outside of the territorial boundaries of the countries in question as on some of the Pacific islands, etc. The President indicated his general accord with this point of view.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_509" n="509" facs="0534"/>
<p>The President said he thought there was a fourth point that might come up which was the British tendency to recognize de facto the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. I recalled that I discussed this with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in London and emphasized that in my opinion this was a very dangerous thing to do because it undermined the basic principle which gave us our rights in Berlin. We were in Berlin as sovereigns and to the extent that we had reserved our rights in Berlin we were as much sovereign there as we were in Washington, D.C., or any place else in the United States. It seemed to me we could never accept the concept of the Soviet Union being able to give the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> rights which would override our own sovereign rights in Berlin. If we did this, our basic position would, as I had said, be jeopardized and could lead to a chain of consequences which would be extremely serious to us. I recalled that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had seemed to accept this thesis when we were in London although he had not gone so far as to say that he had actually committed himself to a degree so there would be any lack of good faith in his now taking a different position.</p>
<p>We then turned to a discussion of some of the practical arrangements of the proposed meeting on Friday.</p>

<p>We asked Bob Bowie<note n="1" xml:id="d233fn1">Bowie was Director of the Policy Planning Staff and Assistant Secretary of State for Policy Planning from 1950 to 1955.</note> down on Wednesday<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">March 18.</note> to give us his views on Berlin and Germany. I thought you might be interested in a brief summary.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Berlin</p>
<p>1. To preserve our position in Berlin, we must be prepared to use whatever force is necessary—to and including general war. There is a good chance that force will be required; at least, we must act on this assumption.</p>
<p>2. We should, therefore, draw the issue in terms which will seem, to our own people and our allies, to warrant the use of force. This means not drawing the issue in terms of substitution of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for Soviet officials. Such a position will command neither allied nor domestic support, but rather cloud the essential issue: our free access to Berlin.</p>
<p>3. To avoid making our acceptance of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials seem like a backdown, we should begin now to de-emphasize this issue, emphasizing that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> are Soviet puppets and that we hold the Soviets responsible for their actions. This will no more involve <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> recognition that our dealings with <gloss target="#t_ChiComs1">ChiComs</gloss> involve their recognition. We should stress that physical interference is the real sticking point rather than who carries it out.</p>
<p>4. If <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials proceed to increased restriction on our traffic, we should:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) Suspend surface military movement to Berlin, and keep flying in essential garrison supplies without calling it an airlift.</item>
<item>(b) If our planes are interfered with, resort to whatever military action is necessary to maintain access.</item>
<item>(c) At some point, be prepared to apply countermeasures elsewhere (e.g., mining the Dardanelles).</item>
<item>(d) If these actions do not maintain our access, resort to a large-scale ground operation designed to seize and maintain control of the autobahn, recognizing that this is very likely to lead to general war (and being prepared to go to general war rather than accept a local defeat).</item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_511" n="511" facs="0536"/>
<p>5. To create maximum deterrence we should now repeat the firm note struck in the President’s speech in a Congressional resolution and drop any pretense of business as usual in our military posture. This is the most serious crisis since World War II and we should act accordingly.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Germany and Europe</p>
<p>6. We should make a respectable offer to the USSR on unity, but we should recognize that it will probably be turned down and we should not allow the Soviets to fuzz that turn-down by ourselves agreeing to any loose confederal relation between the two Germanies.</p>
<p>7. In the European security field, we should not agree to restrictions which would weaken Germany’s attachment to the West, by making it look as though the US and USSR were ganging up on the Federal Republic</p>
<p>8. We should try to use the present crisis to promote European unity. We might make a bold proposal to this end, e.g., US assistance in the creation of genuinely integrated missile-nuclear strategic capability controlled by <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> or the Community of Six.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Questions</p>
<p>1. Asked if substitution would not be the first step on a slippery slope: We are on that slippery slope already, since the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> now controls civilian traffic, and could take action against it at any time.</p>
<p>2. Asked if it would not be very difficult to get support for resisting any minor increase in present traffic procedures: The principle involved (that of physical interference with free access) could be made convincing here, as it could not be made convincing on substitution.</p>
<p>3. Asked if it would not be useful to hold on to the substitution issue for bargaining purposes: On the contrary, this would make its eventual concession a symbol of weakness. The sooner we got rid of this issue, the better position we would be to threaten force convincingly on the issue of no increased interference. If then there was no interference after the turn-over, our firmness would have seemed to pay off. Whereas, if we entered the turn-over period with a concession (having held to “no substitution” right up to the turn-over), the Soviets would be encouraged to press on, as they would not if we now started to play down this question.</p>
<p>4. Asked about “disengagement”: Mutual withdrawals would not reduce the danger and might increase it.</p>
<p>5. Asked about a separate <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> treaty: He did not think this would do such damage to our position in Germany that we should make any significant concessions to the Soviets to avoid it.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_512" n="512" facs="0537"/>
<p>6. In further discussion, Bob repeated this basic point: We must be prepared to face up to general war, recognizing that it may well come to that. All the more reason, he thought, to draw the issue with great care, to make our firmness clear from the very start, and to exhaust every military measure before proceeding to general war.</p>

</list>
<p>At the President’s invitation to me to comment on some of the subjects that he would be discussing with the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, I said that I would first like to speak of the broad aspects of the situation now confronting us, as I saw them. I said that I thought the free world allies should not give the people of the world the impression that we are frightened of the Soviets or that the Soviets are in the driver’s seat. In some parts of the world, notably in Asia, Africa and parts of Latin America, people are watching closely to see whether they think the Soviet Union or the Western Allies are the more powerful. We cannot, of course, prevent <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> from strutting across the stage and making his grandiloquent speeches. But we can avoid the impression that whenever he sounds conciliatory we rejoice and whenever he sounds threatening we are fearful as though he were the Lord of Creation.</p>
<p>As to Berlin, I said that I thought that we should make no concessions nor agree to any changes in the present arrangements except as part of a larger agreement out of which we would get something. I said that I thought our position in Berlin legally and morally impeccable and <pb xml:id="pg_513" n="513" facs="0538"/>our sovereignty there sound; the Soviets cannot by their own act deprive us of sovereignty in Berlin nor put the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> in a position to control our exercise of it. I noted that in such matters we can, as we did in the contractual agreements with the Federal Republic,<note n="1" xml:id="d234fn1">Documentation on the contractual agreements signed at Bonn on May 26, 1952, is in <ref target="frus1952-54v07p1"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. VII, Part 1</ref>, pp. 1 ff.</note> voluntarily renounce some or all of our sovereign rights when it is expedient to do so; but I thought the assumption that, simply because the Soviets challenge our rights and position, we have to seek a compromise, is all wrong.</p>
<p>As to the possibility of an early Summit meeting, I said that I had not found persuasive the arguments favoring such a meeting, and that I did not think we should now agree to go to one unless we can exact a reasonable price in Soviet “deeds not words”. I recalled that in 1955, the Soviets had paid such a price by agreeing to the Austrian Treaty. Also they accepted the composition we proposed. I said that I had seen no evidence that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> now seems prepared to pay a price, but rather to drive us to the Summit by threats. Nor had I been able to think of any acceptable agreement that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might now be willing dependably to make with us. I said that I was opposed to the idea of a Summit meeting premised simply on the hope that it might produce something positive, without having any evidence that there is a real prospect of this. I said that at such a meeting there would be almost irresistible pressure upon the leaders of the democracies to reach an agreement. The Soviet leaders would be under no such pressure and we would be at a distinct disadvantage. I asked the Prime Minister whether in his visit to Moscow he had discovered any element in the Soviet thinking which might give hopes of useful negotiation at the Summit.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister did not indicate that he had any basis for believing that a worthwhile, acceptable agreement could be reached with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He did, however, go on to discuss generally the question of German reunification.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that he had the general impression that zeal for German reunification has somewhat abated. He had discussed this with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">See <ref target="#d217">Documents 217</ref> and <ref target="#d219">219</ref>.</note> and also had tried to elicit the Chancellor’s views on dealing with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Prime Minister said that somewhat to his surprise <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had indicated that he is prepared to accept the status quo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that he had commented to the Chancellor that this seemed to be close to what <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> says he wants and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had replied that the ultimate goal of German reunification could not, of course, be explicitly abandoned and indeed it should be held out as a light at the end of what might be a very long tunnel. In the time that would elapse before this light were reached, <pb xml:id="pg_514" n="514" facs="0539"/>ways could, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> understood <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s view, be found to lighten some of the human burdens borne by the people of East Germany.</p>
<p>I recalled that I had discussed with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> the possibility of arranging for a long-term negotiation by Foreign Ministers and their Deputies, similar to the negotiations that had eventually led to the Austrian Treaty.<note n="3" xml:id="d234fn3">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ discussions with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, see <ref target="#d165">Document 165</ref>.</note> I said that I thought this a possibility which ought not to be wholly discarded in the present situation and I cited too the talks that we have been having with the Chinese Communists.<note n="4" xml:id="d234fn4">Documentation on U.S. talks with the Chinese Communists in Warsaw is presented in volume XIX.</note> Such talks can provide a context for avoiding hostilities, even if the substantive content of the talks is relatively inconsequential.</p>
<p>I repeated that to agree now to go to a Summit meeting at a fixed date in the future would be a grave error and would suggest to the world that we had completely given in to the Soviets, in reversing the attitude we have taken for the past two years, namely that there must be some prospect of fruitful results at a Summit meeting before we could agree to go to one. I thought that it would be most dangerous to ourselves to give such an impression.</p>
<p>I said that if we shall have to face the issue of whether to make prospect of a positive outcome a condition of going to the Summit, I felt that we might as well face it now, while there is still time to find out, free of public pressures. Through a meeting of Foreign Ministers, or privately through diplomatic channels—or, I said, not necessarily through private channels; after all Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had talked directly with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>—we could try to ascertain whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is prepared to make an acceptable deal. I said in this connection I agree with the thought that there will probably not be agreement with the Soviets except with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>; and that in many respects the prospect of talking with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was a bleak and barren one. But I did believe that ways existed for finding out whether or not there was anything that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wanted that we could give and get a quid pro quo; and that the possibility of Deputy talks should not be discouraged.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that as the British people see the present situation, the Soviets, far from adopting an aggressive posture of advancing on the West, have simply said that all they want to do is go away from where they are. The Prime Minister said that if the Soviets carry out their threat to hand over to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> control of our access to Berlin, we shall be faced with very difficult practical problems, not the least of these avoiding <pb xml:id="pg_515" n="515" facs="0540"/>appearing to blockade ourselves out of Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that he saw four possibilities:</p>
<p>1) That the Soviets give in; 2) that we give in; 3) that there be negotiations leading to an agreed solution for Berlin and the broader problems of central Europe, and 4) that there be war. The Prime Minister said that his Government would be quite prepared to mobilize more armed forces if necessary. Also <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> would feel under a duty to try to remove all of the young children from the United Kingdom to Canada so as to keep their stock alive as against the total devastation of nuclear war.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said his Government would not have the necessary public support unless they had a publicly comprehensible issue. He thought that negotiations would have to be attempted and would have to fail, before the British public could be convinced of the need for preparations of force.</p>
<p>The President, on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s point that the Soviets are not “advancing”, observed that they are in fact trying to get us out of Berlin and he wondered whether that were not a sufficiently aggressive issue to be persuasive. I said that I quite disagreed with the Prime Minister’s theory that if we are threatened, we must negotiate, lest the public not support our being firm. I said that our present considerable strength is conceived as a deterrent to Communist imperialist aggression. It is a deterrent, and there is not going to be the war of which the Prime Minister spoke. In being firm we have sometimes to take added risks, such as our sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan and holding Quemoy. But in that instance, I felt sure, our show of firmness and determination, coupled with our deterrent power, had avoided war. On Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s point that the issues now posed in Berlin are so difficult that we should negotiate a new arrangement for the city, I said that I could not agree that there is anything wrong in our present position there. It is the Soviets who are trying to make it wrong, but that does not mean that we have to negotiate with them about it. I asked what is the use of our spending $40 billion a year or more to create deterrent power if whenever the Soviets threaten us and want to take something from our present positions we feel that we have to buy peace by compromise. If that is going to be our attitude, we had better save our money.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister argued that the premises of our position in Berlin, and particularly the premise of our presence by right of conquest, are fast fading away, and that with their control of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the Soviets have the upper hand. Hence, he said, we should try to salvage something by negotiation.</p>

</list>
<p>The Prime Minister gave a brief report on his visit to Paris.<note n="1" xml:id="d235fn1">See <ref target="#d213">Document 213</ref>.</note> He said in general he found the French relaxed, but firm on Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> he thought very nice. General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> talked a great deal and left on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> a firm impression that he is the boss. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> seemed obsessed with the atom bomb in terms of its constituting the ultimate weapon which left nations not possessing it in a secondary role. According to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> felt there was no use preparing for possible difficulty by mobilization or other preparedness measures. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> indicated that this attitude was incomprehensible to him. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> also was reported as considering the main issue or crucial point [was] that at which there was actual blockage of the Allied access to Berlin. In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that the French “agreed with them on everything.”</p>
<p>With respect to his visit to Bonn, the Prime Minister said that he and the Chancellor agreed well.<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">See <ref target="#d217">Documents 217</ref> and <ref target="#d219">219</ref>.</note> He mentioned that in his private talk with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> the latter had suggested securing a commitment from the Russians as a condition precedent to holding a summit meeting an undertaking that the status quo would be preserved for five years. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he did not agree to this and that in the subsequent plenary session the idea was explicitly abandoned.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister believed that the Chancellor had moved into a fundamentally different position from the past. He thinks that he can now live with the status quo though it would be wrong to abandon public lip service to this objective. He said that the Germans agreed with the <pb xml:id="pg_517" n="517" facs="0542"/>British in believing that a fixed date for the summit meeting should be offered in the Western replies to the Soviet note. It was also agreed between them to make as a condition for a summit meeting either through diplomatic channels or by incorporation in the note the understanding that there would be no unilateral alteration of the status quo prior to and during the process of negotiation.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that the Chancellor then inquired about the British ideas for an area or zone of inspection. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> felt that his explanation satisfied the Chancellor and relieved his fears. He said that he told the Germans what he had in mind was an inspection zone within which there would be ceilings on both sides of the lines on force levels and limitations on armaments. Its establishment, however, would be subject to the following three principles: First, there should be no alteration of the present balance of forces to the disadvantage of the West; secondly, its terms should be such that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would not be broken up; nor, thirdly, the United States be forced out of Europe. On the latter point he expressed his view that if United States forces were removed from Germany they would in fact have no place to go except home.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he went on to emphasize to the Chancellor that he was not thinking of disengagement nor of the creation of a great neutral no man’s land which would constitute a dangerous vacuum under modern conditions of war. What he was trying to do was to quell the appeal of the Rapacki plan which had caught the imagination of many unsophisticated people.</p>
<p>The President interjected that he was still confused concerning <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s understanding on the question of prior conditions for a summit meeting because he had been very explicit in telling <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> after the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had agreed to a five-year standstill as a condition precedent.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> replied that when they had heard of this apparent misunderstanding they had sent their Ambassador back to <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> who assured him that there was no misunderstanding on the Chancellor’s part nor on his own.</p>
<p>The President then said jokingly that if we could get a commitment from the Russians to make no change in the status quo for five years then we could postpone going to the summit until the end of that period. He then went on to say with utmost seriousness that he would not go to a meeting under circumstances which made it appear that he had his hat in his hand. To him there was an elemental requirement which must be met and that was the Soviets negotiate at a foreign ministers’ meeting in good faith and progress be revealed. He said with finality that he would not agree at this time to go to a summit meeting on a fixed date.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_518" n="518" facs="0543"/>
<p>There then followed some conversation on the report which had been received of a statement by <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> before his party members to the effect that the Federal Republic might or should extend de facto recognition to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It was noted that if this report was confirmed it represented a very substantial shift in <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s position on relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>

<p>The conversation then turned to Berlin. The President said that we would absolutely refuse “to throw the West Berliners to the wolves.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that as he saw it there were two acceptable solutions for Berlin. First was to deal with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> on our access rights on the basis of an acknowledged agency relationship between them and the Soviets. The second was to negotiate a treaty that would be registered with the United Nations which would guarantee our position in Berlin and the rights of access. This he would regard as an improvement over our present situation. There was some brief discussion as to what effect this would have on our fundamental rights acquired by conquest.</p>
<p>Reverting to the question of the relationship between a Foreign Ministers and a summit conference with the Soviets, the President suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> review the present language of our draft reply<note n="1" xml:id="d236fn1">See <ref target="#d244">Document 244</ref>.</note> and see if there could not be inserted useful quotations <pb xml:id="pg_519" n="519" facs="0544"/>from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s press release the day before<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2">For a transcript of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s press conference on March 19, see Embree, <hi rend="italic">Soviet Union and the German Question</hi>, pp. 139–153.</note> to tie the Soviets to a commitment to genuinely attempt to achieve some progress at the Foreign Ministers level. It was agreed that this would be done though the danger was pointed out of relying on ticker reports of a press conference.</p>
<p>The President then said that a prolonged summit conference or a series of conferences would be impossible for him by reason of the requirements of our Constitution. It might be possible, however, he said, for him to go for two or three days at the opening and leave Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> as his personal representative, returning himself at the conclusion of the conference if the results warranted it.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> then said, with general agreement, that we can’t afford to have another show of the character of the last Geneva Summit Conference which was little more than an exchange of propaganda speeches. This is no way to approach serious negotiation. He felt that the Foreign Ministers should sharpen the issues and outline available choices. The Heads of Government could then negotiate in private with very few plenary sessions.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that there were really two points at issue in our draft reply. One was the agenda and the other was the matter of a fixed date for the summit.</p>
<p>The President suggested that we stipulate that one of the duties of the Foreign Ministers was to explore opportunities for agreement and that dependent on their progress they could then agree on a date for the summit. He reiterated that he would not agree at this time to a fixed date and said that he thought “justify” was a good word to describe what was required of the Foreign Ministers’ meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> raised the question as to whether it would be possible to hold the summit conference in the United States presumably as a means of avoiding the constitutional difficulties of a prolonged absence of the President from the country. Specifically, he wondered if Newport wouldn’t be a pleasant site.</p>
<p>The President indicated skepticism as to holding such a conference in the United States though he did mention San Francisco might be a possible location in light of its background as the scene of the foundation of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> raised the question of Czechoslovakian and Polish participation in the Foreign Ministers conference, and the Prime Minister replied that he liked our formula. The meeting thereupon ended at 4:40 p.m.</p>

</list>
<p>At the conclusion of a prolonged discussion between the Prime Minister and the President (with advisers present) on the form of our reply to the Soviet note, the meeting broke up at 4:40 p.m.,<note n="1" xml:id="d237fn1">See <ref target="#d236">Document 236</ref>.</note> with the President and the Prime Minister leaving for a drive.<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2">For the Prime Minister’s account of the conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> during their drive to Gettysburg, see <hi rend="italic">Riding the Storm</hi>, p. 645.</note> They agreed to return at 6:30 to consider the matter further and suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> continue the discussion.</p>
<p>After a short recess Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJH1">Whitney</persName> and myself met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, Sir Norman Brook and <persName corresp="#p_MSFRH1">Sir Derick Hoyer-Millar</persName>. Each side had in the interval prepared a redraft<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn3">None of the drafts mentioned here has been found.</note> of the Summit language. We were unable to reach agreement.</p>
<p>Upon the return of the President and the Prime Minister from their drive the lack of progress was reported and the Prime Minister retired to draft personally the passage dealing with a Summit conference and agenda. When this draft was ready the meeting between the President and the Prime Minister (with advisers) resumed. The Prime Minister became exceedingly emotional. He said that we were dealing with a matter which in his judgment affected the whole future of mankind. He said that: “World War I—the war which nobody wanted—came because of the failure of the leaders at that time to meet at the Summit. Grey<note n="4" xml:id="d237fn4">Sir Edward Grey, British Foreign Secretary.</note> instead had gone fishing and the war came in which the UK lost two million young men.”</p>
<p>The President interjected that there had been meetings at the Summit before the outbreak of World War II and that those meetings had not prevented that war.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_521" n="521" facs="0546"/>
<p>The Prime Minister rejoined that at that time “we were dealing with a mad man—Hitler.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued that he could not take his people into war without trying the Summit first. If war was to result there was much that he must do. They had no civil defense worthy of the name and this must be rectified. They must mobilize and disperse a substantial part of their people to Australia and Canada. Eight bombs, the Prime Minister said, would mean 20 or 30 million Englishmen dead. Throughout the discussion he kept repeating this reference to eight bombs.</p>
<p>The President said in effect that we cannot consider these problems exclusively in these terms. What we must consider is the alternative of surrendering to blackmail. He reminded the Prime Minister that we would not be immune to punishment. In fact he said that the lowest level of casualties he had seen estimated in event of an all-out thermonuclear attack on this country was 67 million. He emphasized that we don’t escape war by surrendering on the installment plan, that the way to prevent war is by willingness to take the risk of standing on ground which is firm and right.</p>
<p>The President then went on to say that he would not “be dragooned to a Summit meeting.” He said that if there was even slight progress at the Foreign Ministers meeting then he would go but that he would not commit himself now to go under any and all circumstances.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out at this juncture that in the event the Foreign Ministers broke up in total failure we would obviously consider all remaining possibilities for further negotiation including a Summit meeting which might be held in the Security Council.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister reverted to his highly emotional mood saying that he was an old man and that he owed a duty to his people; that this question of agreement now to a Summit meeting was probably the most fateful decision he would ever have to take; that he must sleep on the matter and that he was not prepared to discuss it further that night.</p>
<p>The group then at 7:30 went to the table for dinner and there was no further substantive discussion that evening.</p>

</list>
<p>The group turned at once to the question of the reply to the Soviet note on which agreement had not been reached at the close of the discussion the previous evening.<note n="1" xml:id="d238fn1">See <ref target="#d237">Document 237</ref>.</note> The Prime Minister started by saying that he felt we were close together on a formula for a Summit meeting. There was a difference of opinion as to the effect on the possibility of accomplishment at a Foreign Ministers meeting which would result from a concurrent acceptance of a Summit meeting in the summer. The British wanted to agree to such a Summit meeting and set a date for it in the present reply. They understood, however, our point of view.</p>
<p>The President said that he would repeat to the Prime Minister his past expression of a willingness to look hard for any progress at all at the Foreign Ministers meeting which would justify thereafter holding a Summit conference but that he absolutely refused to promise unconditionally at this point to go to a Summit meeting “come hell or high water.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then put forward new compromise language for this passage in the note. The President also gave the language which we had considered overnight.<note n="2" xml:id="d238fn2">Neither <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s compromise language nor the President’s has been identified further.</note> Agreement was finally reached on the <pb xml:id="pg_523" n="523" facs="0548"/>form of words which was later in the morning telegraphed to our working group representatives in Paris<note n="3" xml:id="d238fn3">Transmitted from Camp David in <gloss target="#t_CPD1">CPD</gloss>–1018, March 21, and received at the Department of State at 2:21 p.m. for transmission to Bonn, Paris, Moscow, and London.

(Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1214)</note> The British accepted our formulation of the agenda item. They also confirmed their acceptance of our phraseology for handling participation by the Czechs and the Poles. There was some further general discussion subsequent to this by the President of the actual text of our note which will vary in its preambular and non-operative passages from the British text. A clean draft of the US note reflecting the President’s changes and approval was also forwarded to Paris for our representative on the working group.<note n="4" xml:id="d238fn4">Transmitted In <gloss target="#t_CPD1">CPD</gloss>–1018 from Camp David, March 21.

</list>
<p>There was some discussion of the plan being developed by the Working Group in Paris as well as the “personal” proposal which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> had just put before the Working Group.<note n="1" xml:id="d239fn1">“<persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>’s Plan” had been tabled on March 19 and involved a declaration by West Germany that it would begin discussion with East Germany on reunification and an all-German government if the East German authorities restored human and political rights in East Germany. (Telegram 3462 from Paris, March 19; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/3–1959)</note> The President expressed himself in favor of the East-West study group envisaged in the American plan and was very emphatic on the impossibility of using the term “confederation” at this stage of any negotiation. It was noted that although the <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> plan made a concession to the Soviet demand for direct negotiations between East and West Germans, it nevertheless had a built-in condition involving the reestablishment of civil liberties and human rights in the Eastern zone which would make it quite unacceptable to the communists.</p>
<p>Adverting to Berlin, the Prime Minister said that according to the French there were two ways to set about getting a settlement. The one was to take existing rights and make agreed adjustments to them such as establishing the “agency” plan. The other method would be to negotiate a new title to Berlin, possibly with United Nations participation. In this connection, the attitude of the Chancellor with respect to de facto recognition was of great importance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> observed that the Chancellor’s reported new position on recognition should open the door to a Soviet concession on the agency issue. The Prime Minister thought that in the short-term the simplest thing might be to follow the first method <pb xml:id="pg_525" n="525" facs="0550"/>but that in the long-term the position of the West would be better preserved by a new comprehensive agreement.</p>
<p>The President noted that the basic Soviet objective was to get rid of Berlin. He said we had sent some people over to take a look on the ground at exactly how the road, air and rail communications to Berlin looked. So far the morale in the city was good and there were weaknesses in the Soviet position that might tend to make them want to negotiate. Nevertheless, there were more than 300,000 Soviet troops surrounding the city and if we made Berlin a free city, it would be easier for the Russians to violate it than in the present situation. The Prime Minister said the object was not to weaken but to strengthen Berlin.</p>
<p>The President said he would have no objection to our beginning our negotiations on a broad concept for German settlement, but that the immediate objective was to get a “breathing space” and a respectable agreement for the next few years. Perhaps we should not talk too much about what East and West Germany were going to do. What we must find was the best formula to maintain the status quo and give the Soviet Union the necessary face-saving.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that everyone was in favor of reunification in principle but the curious situation was that nobody wanted it now, neither the Russians, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> nor the French. (Though he did not say so, he left the clear implication that Britain too did not want it.) Therefore, he concluded, a de facto approach seemed the only feasible one. The President pointed out that when we went to Geneva, we had also been aware of the dangers inherent in the reunification of Germany. <persName corresp="#p_MSFRH1">Sir Frederick Hoyer-Millar</persName> thought that if one were to have a long breathing spell, then the problem was to get a settlement for Berlin.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">United Nations</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary mentioned the United Nations aspect of the Berlin problem and the possibility of taking the issue to the International Court of Justice. He said the Department’s Legal Adviser thought this might be a very useful exercise. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> observed that on the contrary the Foreign Office Legal Adviser thought we would lose on such a submission. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he had also raised the question with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> but had gotten no reaction. As far as the United Nations was concerned, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> thought it best to go to the United Nations after the Russians had taken some overt action. The Acting Secretary thought that we were pretty much in agreement as to how the United Nations could best be used.</p>

<p>At 11:10 a.m. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> joined the main group in Aspen. The discussion of the possible resort to the United Nations in connection with the Berlin crisis was concluding.</p>
<p>The President then told the Prime Minister that we favored tabling at the Foreign Ministers meeting in May a comprehensive and detailed plan for all of Germany including reunification, security arrangements and a treaty. It was our concept that within this framework the problem of Berlin could be readily dissolved. The President said that our proposal which was under study in the working group contained, he felt, great appeal which would be an impact on neutral as well as German and Allied public opinion. He felt it was an ambitious proposal and the right way to approach the negotiation and expect to come out with something more modest.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister indicated without committing himself with any precision that he was in general agreement with this approach.</p>
<p>In some further discussion it was agreed that in our presentation at the Foreign Ministers meeting we would stand on our rights and present position with respect to Berlin but put in a comprehensive package plan in which the problem of Berlin would be wrapped.</p>
<p>The conversation then turned to an explanation by the British of their thoughts on security measures in Central Europe. The Prime Minister said there had been much misunderstanding on this. He said that <pb xml:id="pg_527" n="527" facs="0552"/>he “hated the Rapacki Plan.” At this point <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> interjected that the British “loathed disengagement” but feel they must put something forward on security which would take the field away from woolly proposals for disengagement which seemed to find a broad and sympathetic response not only in British public opinion but elsewhere.</p>
<p>The meeting then broke up for luncheon after a brief discussion of the handling of the press and agreement that there would be no formal communiqué issued at the end of the weekend.</p>

Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> referred to the fact that we had sent a team of qualified people <pb xml:id="pg_528" n="528" facs="0553"/>to “ride the Autobahn” and report the actual facts of the present situation with respect to Soviet and East German procedures so that we might have a completely accurate picture. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked that this team coordinate with the British and French authorities in Germany before returning to Washington so that we might have an agreed tripartite picture of the present situation.</p>
<p>There followed a discussion as to what would constitute interference or obstruction to our access to Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> observed that the military were awaiting precise instructions on this point. The Prime Minister described the issue as being that of determining whose game keeper was acting. And given the possibility that nothing might happen following a Soviet handover to the East Germans, whether we should consider impersonification or actual obstruction as the breaking point. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> noted that the problem really came with the stamping of documents, which was something to which we would not agree. The Prime Minister summarized his question by asking whether the moment for action came when the East Germans actually would effect some obstruction or when they merely said they had the right to do so. The President said we agreed that we should show papers for the purpose of identification, that we found the issue of stamping more difficult. The Acting Secretary stressed the value of a forthright announcement of our position both as to our juridical rights and what we intended to do as a practical matter immediately upon any Soviet handover to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or the signature of a treaty between them and the Soviet Government.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MSFRH1">Sir Frederick</persName> noted that there was an obligation on us to keep access open to Berlin for civilian traffic but that no such obligation rested on the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Prime Minister suggested that the threat to civilian traffic was even more acute than the threat to our military traffic but Sir Anthony Rumbold pointed out that this was not the case, at least under the present announced Soviet policy.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> said that a problem for contingency planning was whether you went to the United Nations after the first refusal by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authorities to let your traffic through on the old basis or whether you tried a second probe to see whether they would support that refusal by force; in other words, whether one wished to create the symbol of force before going to the United Nations or wished to go there before such a symbol of force had been created.</p>
<p>The President said that the Foreign Ministers should be instructed to ascertain what the Soviets really intended to do. He also pointed out that if we were to take any positive action such as blockading the Dardanelles and the Baltic, we would have to have public opinion with us. The Prime Minister again asked whether we acted in the presence of a symbol of authority (paper) or in the presence of a symbol of force (barrier <pb xml:id="pg_529" n="529" facs="0554"/>or other physical obstruction). As far as the United Nations was concerned, he thought we should go there as soon as it was clear at a Summit or elsewhere that no progress was possible with the Russians.</p>

<p>The Four-Power Working Group at Paris met from March 9 to 21 to consider the Western position at a conference with the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Martin Hillenbrand</persName> led the U.S. Delegation, while <persName corresp="#p_LJ1">Jean Laloy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HPF1">Patrick Hancock</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BGGV1">Georg von Baudissin</persName>, respectively, led the French, British, and West German Delegations.</p>
<p>Following initial discussions, March 9–11, the United States Delegation submitted its basic paper “Elements of a Western Position at a Conference with the Soviets” on March 12. This paper included an estimate of Soviet intentions, Western objectives, tactics, a four-stage proposal for German reunification, and proposals on Berlin and became the basis for the final report of the Working Group. See <ref target="#d220">Document 220</ref>.</p>
<p>On March 12 the four delegations also began drafting a reply to the Soviet note of March 2 (see <ref target="#d244">Document 244</ref>), but this work was suspended at British insistence on March 14 until Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> could visit Washington. During the rest of its sessions the Working Group drafted a report that included six sections devoted to Soviet objectives, Allied objectives, method of unifying Germany, security measures in Europe, future status of a reunified Germany, and Berlin; annexes entitled “Proposal for Phased Plan for German Reunification, European Security, and a German Peace Settlement” and “Elements of an Interim Berlin Settlement”; three supplementary papers that considered Soviet intentions, a peace treaty between the Soviet Union and East Germany, and a proposal concerning a preliminary stage of German reunification; and a two-page paper on tactics.</p>
<p>A copy of the report is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1225.

<p>2119. Paris pass <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>.</p>
<p>1. Saw Chancellor today. He told me Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> had on March 17 discussed with <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> certain points I had raised with <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> re my meeting <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> March 13, and latter’s report on his private conversations with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2024).<note n="1" xml:id="d243fn1">See <ref target="#d219fn1">footnote 1, Document 219</ref>.</note> I had been particularly interested in attempting to ascertain from <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> whether <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had in fact committed himself to (1) maintenance status quo for five years as condition precedent to summit; (2) accord summit meetings might be in stages, interspersed with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> and expert conferences.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> had asked London for official British <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> transcript or memorandum on Bonn talks.</p>
<p>3. Memo dated March 15 had been sent by London to Chancellor, and he read it to me in its entirety. Part pertinent to questions I posed <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Steel</persName> were that <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> believed understanding had been reached: a) West should seek agreement, possibly through diplomatic channels, that Soviet would not take unilateral action while conferences in progress; b) a summit meeting could lead to other summit meeting as long as no unilateral action taken by Soviets; <gloss target="#t_C1">c</gloss>) <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> felt Soviets would never agree to five year standstill.</p>
<p>4. Chancellor has given instructions to tell British <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> this memo does not properly correspond with conversations he had privately held with <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> (it was evident according <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had not adequately informed <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> details these talks).</p>
<p>5. Chancellor then read me memo prepared from his own interpreter’s notes. During my talk with him on May 13 he had spoken without notes, but there was no substantial difference between what he had then said and his exposition today, except memo disclosed that he, in conversation with <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>, had stressed opposition to conferences in face of ultimatum, which would continue to exist unless stipulated that standstill had been assented to by Soviets. Such standstill period should not be limited merely to period covered by conferences, but could extend as long as five years. (Chancellor said he had conceived this idea while conferring with <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>.)</p>
<p>Summit meeting, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> told <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>, has been Soviet objective for years, and would represent considerable internal success for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_531" n="531" facs="0556"/>
<p>West should not again make mistake of accepting Soviet wishes without exacting suitable counterconcessions.</p>
<p>6. <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had told <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> he considered these points constructively made, and would give them serious consideration.</p>
<p>7. Another subject discussed, that Chancellor had not previously mentioned to me, was British-German relations. In this connection <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> dwelt on <gloss target="#t_FTA1">FTA</gloss> troubles.</p>
<p>8. At conclusion above, I told Chancellor I had clearly understood during our previous interview that he believed he had obtained commitment from <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> on proposals for five-year standstill and summit in stages. He was disinclined to answer this and replied with the one word “no”.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> then developed what he called part II of his conversation with me.</p>
<p>1. From press accounts of what had transpired at Camp David British had suggested certain freeze of military force on either side Iron Curtain. These contingents already having nuclear weapons would keep them! Those not having them would not get them.</p>
<p>Chancellor had asked his Ambassador Washington to see Acting Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> to advise him what had really taken place but so far had no answer.</p>
<p>2. Reports from his London Embassy had described <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> as having, according to British press, achieved great triumph in bringing UK influence to bear on world policy.</p>
<p>3. Chancellor doubts whether US has agreed to freeze. Hopes not. Subject was never mentioned during <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> Bonn visit. Has instructed Ambassador von Herwarth to ask British Foreign Office exactly what were <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>’s proposals this matter on Washington trip.</p>
<p>4. Under no circumstances, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> emphatically declared, will <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> Govt agree to any such scheme. Proposition of this kind is senseless and would mean end of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> could not accept deal whereby its forces not equipped with nuclear weapons while others had them. I should at once convey such a message to Acting <gloss target="#t_SecState1">SecState</gloss>.</p>
<p>5. Chancellor pessimistically remarked that it seemed to him Western powers were divided as to policy and heading for trouble. Said he had conferred yesterday with <persName corresp="#p_OE1">Ollenhauer</persName>, Carlo Schmid and Erler; even Erler was disturbed over position taken by Brit Govt.</p>
<p>6. No question whatever <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> thoroughly disturbed and aroused over what he considers most serious dangers freeze idea.</p>

<head>244. Editorial Note</head>
<p>Drafting the Western response to the Soviet note of March 2 began the week following its receipt. The Department of State transmitted its initial draft to Paris in telegram 3267 on March 6. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1/3–659) Three days later the French distributed to the other Western powers a draft along similar lines. (Telegram 3262 from Paris, March 9; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 762.00/3–959) Correlation of these two drafts and suggestions by the British and West Germans was undertaken by the Four-Power Working Group in Paris, March 12–14 (see <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>), but work on the drafts was suspended at British insistence until Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had visited Washington. During this visit the Prime Minister and President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> agreed on language regarding a Summit Conference and the agenda for a Foreign Ministers meeting.</p>
<p>The draft text was then taken up again by the Four-Power Working Group for agreement by the French and West Germans. Final agreement was reached by the Working Group on March 23, and the text was then discussed for 2 days by the North Atlantic Council. Documentation on the drafting of the reply, including the several drafts mentioned above, is in Department of State, Central Files 396.1 and 762.00.</p>
<p>At 10:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. in Washington) on March 26 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> delivered to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> the United States reply to the Soviet note of March 2. The note proposed that the Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union convene at Geneva on May 11 to consider questions relating to Germany including a peace treaty and Berlin. The purpose of the Foreign Ministers meeting would be to reach agreements or in any case to narrow the differences between the two sides in preparation for a Summit conference later in the summer.</p>
<list><item>“On this understanding and as soon as developments in the Foreign Ministers meeting justify holding a Summit Conference, the United States Government would be ready to participate in such a conference.”
</item></list>
<p>The note continued that the United States recognized the interests of Poland and Czechoslovakia in certain issues that might arise at the conference, but stated that “at least at the outset” only the four powers responsible for Germany should be involved.

</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> opened by explaining to the President that the State and Defense Departments were coordinating on a couple of subjects, such as reunification of Germany, European security, and contingency planning. The purpose of requesting this meeting is to obtain additional guidance in preparation for the foreign ministers talks to begin on March 31st.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then outlined the one problem in contingency planning which concerns the group, namely, provision for flying over 10,000 feet in the corridors. If we would deliberately fly above this altitude, a measure to which we have previously claimed the right but not exercised, the fact of maintaining a fighter alert for protection of the aircraft might well result in an undesired opening of hostilities. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> added further explanation that our normal procedure is to fly at 6,000 and 8,000 feet. We always have fighters ready for scrambling to <pb xml:id="pg_534" n="534" facs="0559"/>protect our air traffic. Therefore, should difficulties result from this venture, we could possibly have an incident. He further stated that action on the part of the Communists of a minor nature, such as buzzing or flying alongside our aircraft, happens continually and it creates no problem for us. We do not regard any Communist action short of firing across the bow as a hostile act. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> added that while there is a chance of a protest, there is a good chance that this flight might go unnoticed. Polish transports come in at 25,000 feet. The use of a jet or turboprop aircraft would give us a legitimate reason for this reversal of procedures. He added the operating factor that the Soviets are not particularly alert in their four-power airway control center. As a matter of fact, the Soviet member is normally either intoxicated or violently hung over. This factor might well permit the filing of a flight plan about [<hi rend="italic">above</hi>] 10,000 feet without Soviet protest.</p>
<p>The President was highly critical of the actions which have brought about this situation. The fact of our having observed this 10,000-foot ceiling gives this alleged Soviet restriction the stature of a status quo. We therefore place pressure upon ourselves when we bring this matter to a test case. He is concerned over the possibility of alarming the world. However, on balance, he granted permission to send in a jet aircraft over 10,000 feet, using as a rationale the argument that it needs the additional altitude. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> stated that he just wanted the President to know of the potential difficulty.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then explained a rather gloomy eventuality which has come to our attention with regard to the four-power working group that functioned in Paris. The atmosphere has not been conducive to the most constructive work. This has been due to a series of peculiar circumstances with regard to the other nations represented on this group. In the case of the Germans, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> appears to be somewhat in disfavor, and the Germans in the group found it difficult to determine exactly whose lead to follow within their own camp. The French delegation took a practical and realistic stand in this group, but they fear <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and are uncertain as to whether their stand will be backed up. The British have been practically silent, pending the outcome of the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit to the U.S. Accordingly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said we will not learn much until the foreign ministers meeting here in Washington. The President agreed that since many of the delegates to the foreign ministers meeting are en route, there is little that can be done to rectify this situation until they arrive here.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then referred to the U.S. draft of a phased plan for reunification of Germany.<note n="1" xml:id="d245fn1"><ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> This includes some proposals which impinge on the interests of the Department of Defense. They are anxious <pb xml:id="pg_535" n="535" facs="0560"/>not to address any military disengagement arrangements without corresponding political agreements resulting in an over-all settlement. The President stated that this has been our position for six years, that we can unify Germany only under the umbrella of a general agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> agreed that our four-stage plan does represent an over-all plan. To address Berlin by itself would be a retreat from this position. The President reiterated that our goal is for settlement of the German problem through a peace treaty with all of Germany. This would be followed by disarmament negotiations. To the President’s inquiry as to where the U.S. draft position will be tabled, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> indicated that it will be presented at the May 11th foreign ministers meeting,<note n="2" xml:id="d245fn2">In their notes on March 26 (see <ref target="#d244">Document 244</ref>) the Western powers proposed that the Foreign Ministers meeting begin on May 11.</note> at which time the Western powers should table their comprehensive Western position. For the time being, in our March 31st meeting with the Western foreign ministers, we will deal primarily with principles rather than details of implementation.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then reviewed the schedule of action which includes the Western foreign ministers meeting March 31–April 1, the meeting of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council April 2–4, the reconvening of the working group in early April, to complete its work by April 20, and subsequent consideration by the Western governments on April 27, all culminating in the molding of our position for the foreign ministers meeting of May 11th.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> to outline the decisions we hope to reach this next week. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> answered that our primary problem is that of the relationship of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to the Soviets. The American position is that we will deal with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> at check points only with an acknowledged agency relationship between them and the Soviets. Otherwise, we insist on a status quo. The British, on the other hand, would like to see a new contractual agreement between the occupying powers and the Germans. This contractual agreement would maintain all of our current rights but waive occupational status as such. This surprised the President a little bit. He had understood that the British desired only an amendment or codicil. However, he admitted that our viewpoint on this matter is not vital if we maintain essentially our same pre-1959 rights with a couple of amendments and with the name of a new contractual agreement.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> stated that he had been surprised when, at the <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> talks, he had learned that the 1949 agreement<note n="3" xml:id="d245fn3">For text of the final communiqué of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers, see <ref target="frus1949v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 1062–1065.</note> merely reverted to our pre-blockade status, which had been expressed in extremely vague <pb xml:id="pg_536" n="536" facs="0561"/>terms. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> suggested that this fact would argue in favor of a completely new codification of our rights. The President, backed up by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, disagreed with the impression that the rights as spelled out in the pre-1949 status had been vague. The President’s understanding, in which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> concurred, was that our rights of unhindered access were quite clear in those arrangements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> added, however, that the matter of how to exercise those rights had not been adequately spelled out.</p>
<p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> brought up the question of our views with regard to the rights of commercial traffic. This is a most vital point, in his opinion, since a garrison lift as such would be extremely easy to maintain. The President stated that there had been little provision for commercial traffic in any agreements. No need had been visualized for such a provision at the time of agreement. The de facto usage by the West Berliners of the roads other than the one agreed autobahn access route was a matter which had become sanctified only through practice, in a manner somewhat similar to the way in which our 10,000 altitude ceiling had become sanctified. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out that the 1949 agreement reaffirmed the right of the passage of commercial traffic, but the President reminded him that this had applied only to the main access route. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he did not recommend bringing this matter up, but felt we should keep it in mind.</p>
<p>The President then called attention to his understanding of the British concern with regard to interference on access routes. They fear, not an abrupt action in which the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be placed in a position of making the first overt move, but rather, a foot-dragging type of interference with the routes. All agreed.</p>
<p>There was some discussion then of the President’s schedule, in which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> expressed the hope of seeing the President prior to the March 31 foreign ministers meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> indicated that in meetings between State and Defense, the matters that must move to agreement will be identified. Probably a small group will meet with the President either Easter Sunday, March 29, or Monday evening March 30.</p>
<p>The President then asked for opinions on the subject of the efficacy of the four-power working group since they have had difficulties up to this time. He questioned how well they will perform when they meet again in April. In the discussion which followed, it was concluded that the difficulties which have beset the four-power working group up to this time will be largely overcome by the time they meet again. In addition, they will have the benefit of additional guidance stemming from the meeting of the foreign ministers. The President then directed that we <pb xml:id="pg_537" n="537" facs="0562"/>make a study of the history of the four-power working group and from that study identify the items on which we must reach decision. We should also identify what our proposal has been on each, even though those proposals have not been commented on satisfactorily by the other powers. The results should be studied by State and Defense. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> assured the President that a paper is already in existence which does just this, and it is being sent this afternoon to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for study.<note n="4" xml:id="d245fn4">Not further identified.</note> The purpose of this paper is a briefing for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> for the foreign ministers meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> added that the working group had actually identified about fourteen areas to be considered.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> then brought up the matter of a zone of limited armaments. He admitted that he had seen no cables to this effect, but he had read the press conference conducted by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in the morning paper.<note n="5" xml:id="d245fn5">For text of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s press conference on March 25, see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Statements</hi>, pp. 41–51.</note> It appeared to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had opposed measures on which <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had staked his political fate. The President remarked that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> is in a poor position to play the star supporter of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (referring to the declared intention of withdrawing the fleet from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> command in time of war). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName>, however, added that on this particular matter of thinning out forces, he agrees with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in opposing the idea. While not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the President pointed out that he had discussed with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> the virtues of finding some way of implementing a mutual inspection system if only as a gesture to the world. Something of this sort might represent a start.</p>
<p>Here the Vice President inserted the impressions he had received from a conversation at a dinner the other evening, primarily from Representative McCormack. Mr. McCormack had expressed the view that any form of disengagement such as proposed by the Rapaki Plan would be unacceptable. However, some proposal regarding the “freezing” of forces in Germany might be considered. The President agreed and mentioned to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> that in his position paper, which the President had referred to before, we should show some flexibility, and consider not only our optimum position, but also a possible fallback. He then mentioned in passing once more that the news, with regard to the ineffectually of the working group had been most disappointing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> assured the President that this was not the fault of the U.S. delegation.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> then inserted a point on the matter of reunification of Germany. Based on the extensive time which he himself had spent in Germany in a private capacity, he had become convinced that the attitude of the Germans is that the problem of German reunification is <pb xml:id="pg_538" n="538" facs="0563"/>theirs. In this regard, the German businessmen have shown much concern over the attitude of the <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> government. (He mentioned a Mr. Beitz, General Manager of Krupp.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> feels that the recent flexibility shown by <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is the result of pressure from German business. To this Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> mentioned the proposal which has been made by the West German government.<note n="6" xml:id="d245fn6">See <ref target="#d239fn1">footnote 1, Document 239</ref>.</note> It bears strong resemblance to the U.S. “four-stage” proposal, but the conditions which it lays down are so stringent as to require the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to be in the Western camp in order to implement it. The President agreed that the series of “provided thats” leaves no chance for German acceptance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> repeated his impression that the Germans regard their reunification as their own private problem. He recommends that the position of the Germans in the entire matter be kept “out in front” during negotiations. If <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> is now being forced out of his job, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> feels that this eventuality is due to pressures exerted by German business. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> interjected the opinion that the attitude which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> had witnessed is not universally held in Germany. The President repeated that our position has consistently favored free elections in Germany. In this we have learned from the experience of the Versailles Treaty, in which conditions were imposed on Germany from without. Therefore, our initial steps should point to some progress toward the place where the [<hi rend="italic">8 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
<p>The President completed the discussion by reiterating our desire to create a good atmosphere for the Germans to work in, which would not be conducive to the rise of another Hitler. Unfortunately, we are still, after fourteen years, in the position of conquerors.</p>
<p>There was then a brief discussion on the subject of participation of the Poles and Czechs and Italians in the May 11 conference. The President felt that if we admit them initially in the position of mere observers, we are asking for trouble from them. He felt, however, that they might be brought in at a later stage. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> stated that what the Russians are really looking for is the principle of equality of representation.</p>
<p>There was then another brief discussion of the working group in which the view was expressed that this body will find much better results with the benefit of the guidance coming from the next foreign ministers meeting.</p>
<p>The President then conducted a brief discussion with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> on the subject of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> festivities celebrating the tenth anniversary, to be held early in April. He expressed some annoyance at the degree to which he has been required to participate personally.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_539" n="539" facs="0564"/>
<p>The President terminated the meeting by requesting State and Defense to cooperate closely with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> in the formulation of our position paper for the March 31 foreign ministers meeting. He expressed the possibility of making that paper a formal <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> record.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> opened the meeting by inquiring regarding the Secretary’s health. He then noted that it now appeared we would be going to Geneva on May 11.<note n="1" xml:id="d246fn1">See <ref target="#d244">Document 244</ref>.</note> The Acting Secretary said that we were studying the differences in the Soviet replies to the different Western powers. He noted that in the reply to the U.S. the Soviets appeared to take the summit meeting for granted whereas in the reply to the French there were certain different shadings. The Foreign Minister agreed. He said that the point regarding Poland and Czechoslovakia <pb xml:id="pg_541" n="541" facs="0566"/>participating was still not clarified so he assumed that we would spend a week at the Foreign Ministers’ meeting discussing it. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> remarked on the amiable tone of this Soviet note. He concluded that the Soviets wished to have talks and they were therefore pleased by the tone of our last notes and by our having made a definite offer. He remarked that he had crossed on the plane with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d246fn2"><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> was returning from Moscow where he discussed the Berlin situation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on March 25 and 26. On March 31 <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> had briefed him on the discussion and stated that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had assured him that there would be no unilateral action on Berlin until the possibilities of negotiation had been fully explored. (Telegram 840 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/3–3159) <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> elaborated more on his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> in the quadripartite Foreign Ministers meeting on April 1; see <ref target="#d250">Document 250</ref>.</note> and that the latter said he was pleased with the tone of the last French note.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister said that the principal difference between the French and British positions on substance was that the British believe that we should be flexible at the start of negotiations with the Soviets whereas the French believe we should be tough at the start. The Acting Secretary said that we could discuss these problems at the tripartite meetings this afternoon and that the first point of discussion would be the French comments<note n="3" xml:id="d246fn3">The French comments have not been found, but they are described further in <ref target="#d247">Document 247</ref>.</note> which had been submitted yesterday. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that we hope to have a U.S. redraft by 2:45 this afternoon. He added that the new French text had been helpful.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> stated that with regard to contingency planning we had been discussing details for the past three or four months without any agreement on a firm common policy. He said that admittedly it was difficult to plan in advance. However, the basic principle we should enunciate is the demonstration of our manifest will to maintain our access rights to Berlin. We must say that we must have the will not to be blocked by Soviet actions. Furthermore, demonstration of our will should not be dependent on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> since recourse to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would merely delay any action. The Acting Secretary agreed a self-imposed blockade was unacceptable. He said we should make clear that if unacceptable conditions were imposed involving the East Germans we would send a force to Berlin of such degree as <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> believed necessary. We must also determine at what point no further negotiations were possible. In all events we must demonstrate that we have the will to maintain our rights. The Acting Secretary agreed with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s reasoning and said it was of course clear that we must show manifest will to maintain our rights. However, there was also a question of timing and of what overt steps we should take in the military field to show this will and at what point we should establish a <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> air alert, etc. He said we <pb xml:id="pg_542" n="542" facs="0567"/>were also considering the possibility of a naval blockade of the Black and Baltic Seas.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> noted that we might at some point have recourse to the Security Council. The Acting Secretary said that if we went to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at all it should be presumably after the Soviets had granted full sovereignty to the East Germans and concluded a peace treaty with them, thus altering the status quo. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> thought that the Western Powers might report to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> under Article 51<note n="4" xml:id="d246fn4">Under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter U.N. member states reported measures taken in self-defense, but these measures did not affect the authority of the Security Council to take actions it deemed necessary to maintain or restore peace.</note> since this was undoubtedly a situation giving concern but that we should not submit a case to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Acting Secretary said that until such time as we might or might not decide to have recourse to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> we should make clear our intent to exercise our rights in Berlin.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Minister said that the Soviets were unlikely to take any drastic measures during the long negotiating period on which we were now embarked. The danger would be great however after the failure of a summit meeting. The danger at that point would be so great that we would be bound to take measures. [2 <hi rend="italic">lines of source text not declassified</hi>] Tactically, he thought it important to show our determination at the start.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary agreed that this was extremely important. He also thought we must try to avoid the problem whereby we have the threat hanging over our heads during negotiations with the Soviets of the conclusion of a Soviet-East German peace treaty.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary reverted to the Working Group paper<note n="5" xml:id="d246fn5">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> on Germany and asked if there were any points to be made on this now. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he did not believe so although much preparatory work remained. He thought disengagement was the principal problem. He said he was unable to ascertain what is in the minds of those who favor disengagement and he considered it a very vague concept. The Acting Secretary said that this point was not clarified at the Camp David talks.<note n="6" xml:id="d246fn6">See <ref target="#d235">Documents 235</ref>–<ref target="#d240">240</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that the British had been vague in their recent talks with the French in Paris<note n="7" xml:id="d246fn7">See <ref target="#d213">Document 213</ref>.</note> too and as far as he could see had been precise only with the press. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he thought perhaps the United Kingdom might at a later date reveal a desire to break the disengagement element alone out of a package proposed allegedly in order to relieve tensions. However, this point had not been reached yet. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> <pb xml:id="pg_543" n="543" facs="0568"/>said that we were opposed to disengagement but might consider some thinning out proposal as part of a package. Furthermore it was unclear whether we were really talking about a thinning out proposal or a freeze of the status quo. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that for the Foreign Ministers’ meeting we were left with an agenda relating to Germany only and he wondered how disengagement fitted into such an agenda. He would not propose any disengagement scheme. The Soviets wanted to talk about a peace treaty and Berlin, and accordingly he did not see how disengagement arose in this context. He thought that the British idea was to present a disengagement scheme to the Soviets as a trade for the settlement of the Berlin problem. He thought that this implied the neutralization of Germany, and concluded that this matter should be discussed further in the Working Group. The Acting Secretary said that we did not intend to raise the disengagement question. Furthermore we had discussed a thinning out proposal only as part of an over-all political settlement of the problem and not as a trading point. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> pointed out his belief that there would not be any general political settlement. The Acting Secretary said that, however, we should nonetheless have an over-all plan to present to the Soviets perhaps including proposals of this type but that it should be made clear that this was a nonseparable package.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> inquired regarding the British idea of a “new and better title” for Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that this was also rather unclear and was clear only on the point that the British intended to substitute a contractual right in Berlin for the present arrangement. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that this was apparently envisaged under the aegis of the United-Nations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that it was also apparently limited to East Berlin only and not to Eastern Germany. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that he thought we should maintain our present title which was both clear and satisfactory. Furthermore he was afraid that a new title might involve a greater role for the <gloss target="#t_WE1">UN</gloss> which he opposed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that we agreed and did not see why we should weaken our present clear rights. The Acting Secretary said that furthermore any solution must be acceptable to the German people. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that we would probably have a very difficult discussion on this point and that he thought it was a mistake to accept something dangerous at the outset. The Acting Secretary agreed saying that the Soviets had taken the initiative in upsetting the status quo and he did not see why we should make concessions at the beginning. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed that we had not asked for any change in the present situation. The Acting Secretary said that the British apparently had in mind the consideration that East Germany can squeeze the economic life out of Berlin by a policy of harassment and that they therefore felt concessions might be necessary in order to preserve the status quo in Berlin.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_544" n="544" facs="0569"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> reported on <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName>’s impressions in Moscow. He said that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had repeatedly stated that he did not intend to menace or threaten the West but merely wished to negotiate. He did not consider any of his recent notes as an ultimatum. His policy was to consolidate the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Berlin was accordingly a secondary problem. However, Berlin as presently constituted represented a weak point for the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Therefore this was not a problem per se. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> concluded that any Berlin solution must therefore not be such as to prevent the consolidation of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Acting Secretary concluded that from the tactical point of view the Soviets must present a convincing case before we should make any concessions on Berlin.</p>
<p>In response to a question from <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> as to how long the Foreign Ministers’ meeting might last, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> guessed perhaps a month. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he thought that a summit meeting would probably be shorter. The Acting Secretary said it would certainly be shorter in so far as the President’s participation was concerned but that the Vice President could replace him if necessary. They agreed that it seemed almost inevitable that a summit meeting would end with directions being given to Foreign Ministers to implement certain questions as had been done in 1955. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that he thought the idea of holding periodic summit meetings was a good method for insuring our having a crisis every six months. The Acting Secretary pointed out that the U.S. system of Government was very awkward for this idea of holding recurrent summit meetings. He mentioned the Congressional problems involved as well.</p>

</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> stated that the new French formulation concerning military aspects of contingency planning<note n="1" xml:id="d247fn1">The French formulation is described in <ref target="#d246">Documents 246</ref> and <ref target="#d248">248</ref>.</note> was the opposite of what the French had proposed in January [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that what the French are driving at is for our military experts to plan now what we would do militarily in case negotiations fail.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> added that the wording of the French formulation does not worry him but Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>’s interpretation of it cannot be accepted. The Foreign Secretary expressed his belief that the minute worked out at Camp David,<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">A copy of the agreed U.S.-U.K. minute is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1214.</note> namely that we will decide what to do militarily in light of the situation as it develops, is the best course. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> reviewed a number of steps which the U.S. has in mind for this contingency, such as certain types of mobilization, action in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and other means of alerting public opinion and obtaining support for the Western position. He did not see any great difference in wording between our own agreed minute and the French proposal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> reviewed the substance of the French paper and concluded that its tone was more positive than ours. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he was all for firmness even “from those with only families left in Germany”. He said he wanted to ask the French what the change in their attitude since January actually is <pb xml:id="pg_546" n="546" facs="0571"/>and what their new paper really means. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that he agreed that this should be done since it is important not to let language go with different interpretations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> reiterated that there can be no automatic decision now to take measures later on [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he liked the French language which went beyond our agreed minute and suggested that we ascertain whether <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> agrees with our interpretation of it. It was agreed that the French would be sounded out accordingly.</p>

<p>The Acting Secretary opened the meeting by welcoming the British and French Foreign Ministers and their staffs. He declared that the two principal tasks of the meetings today and tomorrow would be to review the Working Group Report and to consider the responsibility of the three Foreign Ministers to report to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers on Contingency Planning. Contingency Planning had been the subject of much discussion. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> yesterday had presented a new draft<note n="1" xml:id="d248fn1">See <ref target="#d247fn2">footnote 2, Document 247</ref>.</note> which might be the subject of discussions here. There was the further problem of how to divide up the reports to be made to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He asked if the other Foreign Ministers had any general remarks they wished to make.</p>
<p>When neither <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had indicated a desire to make such remarks the Acting Secretary said that perhaps it would be better if we start with the Contingency Planning paper to be sure we are all in agreement on the meaning of the words used and the reasoning behind them.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> referred to the 18 page Contingency Planning paper<note n="2" xml:id="d248fn2">Not found. The agreed contingency planning paper is printed as <ref target="#d255">Document 255</ref>.</note> considered by the Tripartite group in Washington (Deputy Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and the British and French Ambassadors) and noted that it was essential that we know what we want and what our policy is. It was a question of high and important policy. If our convoys are blocked enroute to Berlin, did we want to take action? If we want to start something then the paper must express our will to take action. He recognized that it was difficult to take a decision in advance of actual developments since we do not know exactly what our position may be at the time. The situation represents a test of our will. From that point of view the draft given us a week or two ago<note n="3" xml:id="d248fn3">Presumably the draft referred to in <ref target="#d247fn2">footnote 2</ref> above.</note> is not very clear. It says if our probe doesn’t succeed then we will suspend traffic and take certain steps which, however, will not prevent our continuing to be stopped.</p>
<p>He referred to paras. 9 and 10 of the contingency paper and said that we should change the wording to allow us freedom to act to restore our freedom of passage. This did not imply anything which would prevent us taking all necessary steps to inform public opinion or report to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We shouldn’t say something in the paper which results in our suspending traffic and leaves us no way to resume it.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> commented that he had just seen the new wording. He agreed with the position of the French Gov’t as stated in January. He read from the French statement of that period. That statement was in complete accord with British views. The British position was still the <pb xml:id="pg_548" n="548" facs="0573"/>same. If the new paper was not a departure from <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName>’s position in January the British agreed to it.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> had suggested changing “whether” to “when”. There was no US objection to the <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> formula, assuming there is agreement among us all as to what it means.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> stated that the paper really means:</p>
<list type="participants">
<head>a. we want to maintain communications;</head>
<item>b. we will take all necessary measures to do so;</item>
<item>c. a final decision will be made on the foregoing basis and in accordance with existing circumstances.</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> agreed with French statement.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary said that we would like to see para. 9 left in.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> insisted that he did not like the statement in para. 9 that “allies will temporarily suspend traffic”.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary agreed that the statement could be strengthened. Actually the military effect of suspension would not be important since our garrisons have plenty of supplies.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> noted that the wording looks like we are willingly accepting blockade. This, of course, was not so, but de facto we would be stopped while considering what to do next.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary commented that this was understood. From a practical and military point of view, we would want to take time to get ready for future action rather than resort to shooting. We would be trying to get public opinion on our side while intensifying our military preparations. These courses of action go on independently.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> noted, however, that when suspension had been accepted, it became very hard to resume movement.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked if we needed to refer to suspension of traffic, and suggested that the phrase “will temporarily suspend traffic” be taken out. He asked <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> if this made the para, more palatable. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> replied affirmatively. He then noted that if we go to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> before taking action ourselves, we tie our hands. This was a very dangerous procedure.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> remarked that there was nothing mandatory about going to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested inserting the phrase “One possibility is that . . . .” (matter could be taken to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>). He did not in the least subscribe to the necessity of going to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He didn’t like to contemplate that organization getting hold of our problems. He suggested language “perhaps to the General Assembly” . . .<note n="4" xml:id="d248fn4">Ellipses in the source text.</note> If we got a favorable vote (say 9 to 2) in the Security Council we might not find it necessary to <pb xml:id="pg_549" n="549" facs="0574"/>go to the GA at all. It was not quite clear how para. 10 would read if changes to para. 9 were accepted.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said it was difficult to know what to do until the time comes. It was much more difficult to take action later than on the spot. Whatever does happen will be only after a Summit Conference.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary agreed. A first indication of failure will be when the Soviet Government signs a separate Peace Treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> remarked that in any case <gloss target="#t_WE1">we</gloss> should make such advance preparations as we can.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked if he meant we should not exclude some immediate reaction? Did he feel we might be committing ourselves to endless talk? This was one thing which ought to be examined—how were we going to play out our hand?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> replied that the paper should provide that if our probe doesn’t succeed then the three Governments may take immediate action or act only after efforts to win over public opinion and such other intermediate steps as they may deem necessary.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> noted that the document had originally been drawn up with a May 27 deadline in mind. The situation was now somewhat different with a Foreign Ministers meeting and a Summit Conference in view which virtually everyone now regarded as inevitable. He did not wish to exclude other possibilities in the new situation.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary noted that para 9 had been corrected as indicated.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked what the phrase in para 10 “further to” meant. Did it mean “further to 8”?</p>
<p>A general conference among individual delegations followed for several minutes. The Acting Secretary then resumed, raising the problem of the contingency planning report to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. There had been some study yesterday in our own group as to how much detail to go into with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in view of the very real interest of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in the whole matter. He noted that this was a very sensitive paper.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> declared that there were two possible ways to handle the paper, either on the basis that it was going to leak or that it wasn’t. He then made a special plea for keeping all conversations confidential if at all possible. Both the Acting Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed to the necessity for the tightest possible security measures. The Acting Secretary asked whether it was preferable not to have the report deposited in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested depositing the report only with the Secretary General of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Acting Secretary suggested that with regard to taking the matter to the Council, it would be appropriate if either <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> made the presentation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> joined the meeting at <pb xml:id="pg_550" n="550" facs="0575"/>this point.<note n="5" xml:id="d248fn5"><persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, who was in the United States March 29–April 7 for consultations, met with the President from 2:47 to 3:27 p.m. In his diary <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> noted that the President “affirmed his belief that the determination to use nuclear power, if necessary, to maintain our position there [in Berlin], was the best way to influence the Soviets to be reasonable.” (Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D 327)</note> The report to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council should give some background, putting Soviet probes throughout the world in their proper context.</p>
<p>There was discussion at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s initiative of the agenda of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> 10th anniversary meeting. It was noted that Berlin would be high on the agenda of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers, under the general heading of The International Situation in the Light of Current Developments.</p>
<p>It was decided that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> would make one statement to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> the other, but the decision would be withheld until tomorrow as to which of the two Ministers would report on Contingency Planning and which on the Four Power Working Group agreed report.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary then asked for reactions, if any, to the Soviet note. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> declared that he had “reacted” to it three times at three different airports. He had said that it was satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary asked if the Soviet reply to the French note had been the same as given on the ticker. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> replied affirmatively. The gist was that if everybody was a “good boy” everything would be all right. He handed the Acting Secretary a copy. The latter noted that the implication of the Soviet reply was that if the Foreign Ministers conference failed, there was all the more reason to have a Summit Conference. He then read aloud a brief draft statement to the press to be issued today by the three Foreign Ministers giving their reaction to the Soviet note. The statement was discussed and later agreed upon by the quadripartite meeting.<note n="6" xml:id="d248fn6">For text of this statement, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1959</hi>, pp. 639–440.</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> raised the question of participation of other countries. He noted that our last notes to the USSR had sought to exclude the Poles and Czechs from the Foreign Ministers meeting and had implied that if the Russians insisted on the Poles and Czechs participating, we obviously would want others, above all Italy to participate. He assumed therefore, that if the Russians insisted on Polish and Czech participation we would then insist on Italian participation.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary noted that the Soviets would immediately counter with a demand that Rumania be included. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> declared that the British view was that it would be best to have only the Four Powers with German advisers. If the Poles and Czechs attend as observers then <pb xml:id="pg_551" n="551" facs="0576"/>Italy should be offered the same status and left to decide whether it wishes to accept If the Poles and Czechs attend as full members, we must have Italy even if it means bringing in Rumania.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary noted that we had been approached also by the Dutch and the Belgians. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> noted that this had been discussed last year with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which had agreed that Italy should be represented. The Italians said they are going to have <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s and therefore ought to be represented. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> noted that the Soviets already knew about Italy’s demands. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> stated that the Soviets didn’t seem to be pressing very hard. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> remarked that perhaps we can all get off the hook. The Acting Secretary declared we should avoid a discussion again in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> if we could. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> remarked that this would be difficult to avoid in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ministerial meeting.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary asked if there was any further business to take up before the 4:45 meeting. Discussion of the wording of the statement to the press was resumed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> remarked that he hoped this would be the only “Pablum” for the press during the entire session. He asked for agreement that there not be a leak of every word to the press. The Acting Secretary remarked that a public posture of unity was one of the most essential points to be borne in mind. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> didn’t want to tell anything to the press and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed. After conferring with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName>, the Acting Secretary remarked that he felt we should give the press something every day. It needn’t be substantive.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> returned to Contingency Planning. He wondered whether the para, beginning on middle of page 2 of the report to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss><note n="7" xml:id="d248fn7">A copy of this four-page report, April 1, which traced contingency planning since November 1958, is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1227.</note> with “A more crucial phase” was precisely consistent with the formulation on which there had been previous agreement? He was not quite clear as to what it meant. He asked if the reference to limited military force referred to the “Scout Car” concept (i.e. a probe with one or more lightly armored vehicles). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> replied that the Scout Car concept or other means might be inferred. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> agreed that the Soviets (and/or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) must be put in the position where they have to shoot to stop us. But he did not agree to sending tanks after Scout Cars. The para, was not clear. The Acting Secretary explained that if the Soviets (<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) closed the barrier we would open it and attempt to go through. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> agreed that this interpretation was acceptable. He then referred to the question of flights over 10,000 feet. He understood the US had sent in a flight several days ago at 25,000 feet to assert our right of passage at that altitude.<note n="8" xml:id="d248fn8">The flight had been made on March 27. On April 4 the Soviet Union protested the use of the air corridor above 10,000 feet and on April 13 the United States rejected the protest. For texts of the Soviet note and the U.S. response, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, May 4, 1959, pp. 632–633. Additional documentation on the flight is in Department of State, Central File 762B.5411.</note> He <pb xml:id="pg_552" n="552" facs="0577"/>understood that it had been accompanied by Soviet fighters. Was there an intention to make such flights again?</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary gave some background on the question. We had voluntarily refrained from flights over 10,000 feet. The Soviets have said flights over 10,000 feet are made at our own risk. When it came to planning a garrison airlift the Air Force had noted that the types of planes to be used needed to fly over 10,000 feet for maximum operating efficiency. The Air Force wanted to establish this as normal procedure, not tied exclusively to a garrison airlift. The need to fly over 10,000 feet was based on the characteristics of individual planes. Planes of other countries are flying above 10,000 with impunity.</p>
<p>He noted that Soviet fighters had flown within ten feet of our C–130 and that we had protested this dangerous practice.<note n="9" xml:id="d248fn9">A copy of the protest, made on March 28, was transmitted in telegram 2160 from Bonn, March 28. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762B.5411/3–2859)</note> We had planned to make another such flight today. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> (Defense) noted that we planned to continue such flights but only under conditions of unlimited visibility.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> expressed his feeling about our preparatory measures by wondering aloud whether they shouldn’t have been cleared with our Allies. Now our right had been asserted, what was the point of going on? We have been trying to put the Soviets on the spot in negotiations. Were we now trying to create an incident which would make negotiations impossible? We have had a position of being reasonable people. Do we want to provoke an incident possibly resulting in a fatal accident? We wouldn’t want to go to a meeting if American flyers had just been killed. He was not questioning either our right to fly or to assert this right. We had accomplished this, however.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary declared that he appreciated having Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s views and declared that the question was under consideration here. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked about the Soviet reply to our protest in <gloss target="#t_BASC1">BASC</gloss>. The Acting Secretary replied that the Soviets had said we had no right to fly over 10,000 feet. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked if this was a military cargo plane. Would garrison airlift planes have to fly over 10,000 feet? The Acting Secretary replied affirmatively. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> remarked that there may be a genuine accident but it would automatically become an incident. The Acting Secretary stated that we felt the introduction of new planes was a valid reason to make the flights. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> noted that the provocation was on the other side.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> replied that if you don’t go on you accept the Soviet position that you have no right to do so. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> would feel better if we sent fighter escort with planes. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> replied that he did <pb xml:id="pg_553" n="553" facs="0578"/>not understand the purpose of continuing the exercise. Did we want an incident or didn’t we? He thought it unwise but it is for the US to decide.</p>
<p>The meeting ended at 4:35.</p>

<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> opened the meeting by extending a warm welcome to the other Foreign Ministers and stressing the importance of the meeting. He then outlined the objectives of the meeting. The Foreign Ministers should give their formal approval to the agreed portions of the Working Group Report,<note n="1" xml:id="d249fn1">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> resolve as many as possible of the outstanding issues in the Report and instruct the Working Group to study the issues which remain unsolved and lay down policy guidance for the next Working Group session on the substance and presentation of the Western position. They should also agree on a report to be made to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council to be as complete as possible in giving their preliminary views. They should also report to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council on contingency planning measures.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then emphasized the importance of keeping publicity to a minimum. It was vital that nothing should detract from the emphasis which must be placed at this time on the unity of the West. There was great danger that any discussions outside of this room might be seized upon by the avid press and create an impression among the public of differences and divisions between the Four. He hoped that the Ministers could agree this afternoon on a non-substantive communiqué.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> warmly supported Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s remarks about publicity. He hoped that they could agree on a line which would not be exceeded and that it would be understood that no additional information would be given.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> began his remarks by saying that he had not had an opportunity fully to analyze the Working Group report. The report had only been submitted to the German Government last Thursday and the Government had not completely finished its analysis. Thus he hoped that the report would only be discussed along general lines and no decisions about particulars would be taken at this time until the German Government had fully considered the implications of the Report.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that the work of the Working Group would be thoroughly reviewed again at the meeting of the Foreign Ministers on April 27 in Paris. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> added that everything that was done at this time was revisable. He hoped that the Ministers would not feel that they would be prevented from beginning discussion of the substance of the report at this time and would find themselves unable to give guidance to the Working Group.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then commented on the general approach of the United States Government to the plan which had been prepared by the Working Group. It considered the plan to be one comprehensive package. This package should be designed so that it would appear reasonable <pb xml:id="pg_555" n="555" facs="0580"/>and would receive Western public support. If this was agreed it would provide the Working Group with a general frame of reference. It was especially important that the principle is clearly spelled out that the various parts of the package are inseparable. The other side would undoubtedly attempt to pick out bits and pieces of the plan which suited them and would try to get them accepted independently of the other features of the plan. This would be extremely dangerous. It must be made absolutely clear that the Western plan is a unit and must be taken as a whole or not at all.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then asked <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> to comment in general on German thinking on the subject of reunification.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> then summarized some of the general considerations in the light of which the German Government viewed the plan of the Working Group. Anything which led in the direction of a confederation was completely unacceptable. It was impossible to have a confederation between states or parts of states which are built upon different principles—which do not agree at least on the basic objectives which they have in mind. One has only to refer to the stated objectives of the Soviet Zone to see how completely incompatible they are with those of the Federal Republic. Any plan which provided for the formation of an all-German body composed of representatives chosen by the Soviet Zone regime would mean that the body would include some Communists who were in no way representative of the German people. He therefore had serious objections to the alternate plan suggested by the American delegation to the Working Group.<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">Reference is to the U.S. four-stage plan for German reunification, submitted to the Working Group on March 12; see <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> If we adopt such thoughts we would find ourselves approaching the concept of a confederation. It would be particularly dangerous to allow such a body to draft a constitution. Providing for a referendum would be no safeguard. The population would be quite uncritical if called upon to vote for a constitution if they felt that an affirmative vote would bring about reunification. They would vote in a highly emotional frame of mind and would accept practically any constitution rather than placing themselves in a position of voting against reunification by voting against the constitution. There was a great danger that such a constitution would leave the Soviet Zone free and unfettered to infiltrate the Federal Republic.</p>
<p>He also expressed the opinion that any group composed on the basis of Laender in the Soviet Zone and the Federal Republic would prove to be an unreliable body in terms of drafting a constitution. The delegates from the Eastern Laender would not be representative of the people. There was a great danger that some Western delegates having <pb xml:id="pg_556" n="556" facs="0581"/>affinities with leftist groups would work together with delegates from the Soviet Zone in producing a constitution which would tend to become a communist constitution and would not provide the necessary safeguards for democratic institutions. A referendum would provide no safeguard.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> said that he also had serious objections to the idea of giving the Laender parliaments competence to deal with economic and social affairs. The Federal Government recognizes that it would be impossible to transfer the institutions of West Germany to the Soviet Zone in one single act. It would be extremely difficult to make such transfers. But to place power to deal with social and economic institutions in the hands of legislatures under the strict control of the <gloss target="#t_SED1">SED</gloss> would contribute to the disintegration of Germany. It would be unthinkable to set up in such a small area as the Soviet Zone social and economic institutions different from those in the rest of Germany. Such a proposal would be quite impracticable.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> concluded that we must find other ways and means than those proposed here which were completely wrong.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> commented that the proposals which had been approved by the Working Group had been based on thoughts which had been contributed largely by the German members of the Group.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> replied that it had been valuable that the Working Group had made a number of proposals and their discussions had not been dogmatic in tone but their recommendations now had to be considered very carefully.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> added that the views expressed by <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> had never been reflected in the discussions of the Working Group which had begun its discussions in February.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> replied that this showed the need for further detailed analysis. It would be dishonest on his part if he concealed his views. The Working Group had only a limited time in which to work. The task of the Foreign Ministers was to examine all points and raise objections as necessary. He had to emphasize that he would be very disturbed if the proposal outlined in the Working Group paper was accepted. It would lead to a situation similar to that which had existed in Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> then referred to the German paper<note n="3" xml:id="d249fn3">See <ref target="#d239fn1">footnote 1, Document 239</ref>.</note> which had been submitted toward the end of the Working Group session. It contained the idea of introducing preliminary conditions for cooperation between the Federal Republic and the Soviet Zone. This would provide some way for reducing the tension between the two parts of the country <pb xml:id="pg_557" n="557" facs="0582"/>which he had referred to previously. The recognition of human rights and political liberties by the Soviet Zone was a necessary precondition for any political collaboration with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> concluded by saying that most of his remarks had been directed against the alternate plan proposed by the U.S. delegation. The first proposals which had been approved by the Working Group as a whole did not go nearly so far. For example, they did not speak of a constitution being drafted by a body which was not elected and did not have any provisions dealing with the competencies of the Laender.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> asked the German Foreign Minister whether the German plan on preconditions had been drafted by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> and was conceived of as a reserve position in case it was desirable to propose direct East-West German conversations. He then asked whether <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> would be prepared to submit a proposal tomorrow which the Group could consider. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> replied that he would submit a paper tomorrow.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> summed up the position of the German Foreign Minister. As he understood it there were three proposals on German reunification. First was the approved plan contained in Annex I of the Working Group Report; second was the American alternate plan; third was the supplementary plan which had been prepared by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>. He understood that the German Foreign Minister had strong reservations about the second and the third. He wondered whether the Germans believed there were elements of at least the first plan which could be kept. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>’s summation was correct.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> suggested that discussion of particulars about what the Germans were willing to accept be postponed until tomorrow since <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> had promised to introduce a paper at that time. It would be more profitable to continue the discussion on the basis of this paper.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> then said that he wished to discuss another part of the Working Group report—namely, the section on security measures and disarmament. He referred to the mention of the limitation of forces in paragraph six and at the end of paragraph 31 in stage II. These paragraphs related the total force levels of the Four Powers to limitations in an area comprising Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia and to progress towards reunification. He had grave doubts about the wisdom of these measures. He did not see the connection between limitations of the total forces of the Four Powers and the German question. In short he questioned the wisdom of linking general disarmament to German reunification and European security. He did not think it would facilitate the discussion of German reunification to make it dependent <pb xml:id="pg_558" n="558" facs="0583"/>on progress in general disarmament. He did not think this sounded like a serious proposal. Therefore he doubted that it would have appeal for public opinion.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that he agreed that we would not want the discussion of German reunification to turn into a discussion of disarmament. He pointed out that the plan contained no commitment on the limitation of arms except as part of an agreement also providing for the settlement of political questions. He disagreed, however, in his estimate about public reactions. He thought the idea of concomitant progress towards disarmament would have a great deal of public appeal. He added that both the U.S. and the French had insisted on the connection between the reduction of troops of the major powers and progress in the settlement of political questions.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> replied that he thought we had always put things the other way around. We had never made progress on reunification dependent on disarmament. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> repeated that he thought if the two were represented as going hand in hand this would have a considerable appeal to public opinion. If it were possible to secure reunification independently of disarmament this would probably be highly desirable but most people did not think this was so. There is a natural feeling that the reduction of tensions which would result from progress in disarmament would increase the chances for reunification.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> replied that one should make a distinction between general disarmament and European security. We had long been in favor of special measures in the European security field. But general disarmament was quite a different matter.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> said that we were all aware that under present circumstances there was no such thing as European security in isolation. This would only produce insecurity. It is necessary and logical that a beginning be made in the disarmament field. What is essential, however, is that one does not stop at the first step in disarmament. Progress must continue step by step. Unless there were this kind of progression there would be a danger of a change in the military balance of power to our disadvantage. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> commented that this view was shared by the U.S. military experts.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> directed the attention of the other speakers to specific paragraphs of the Working Group paper. He said he understood that <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> had objected to paragraphs 16 through 20 of Annex A of the Working Group Report. But they do not have the same objections to paragraphs 8 through 15. He understood that the Germans considered that the latter paragraphs could be discussed. Referring to the French distaste for paragraphs 6 and 31, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that <pb xml:id="pg_559" n="559" facs="0584"/>his view on these sections would depend upon what was in the rest of the paper.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that the parts in the paper dealing with disarmament would bring us close to the 1957 London disarmament proposals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> asked what was the use of doing so. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> commented that it was getting to be a question of what would be left in the plan. He asked the Germans what they thought of the staged approach to reunification.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> said he believed it was essential that the creation of any all-German body must be preceded by the reestablishment of political freedoms in the Soviet Zone. Otherwise there would be Communist party delegates in the all-German body who would block reunification. We cannot build on the basis of two Germanies or two parts of Germany which are totally different in structure and ideology. We must find some kind of a democratic basis on which to build. Once this has been done there would be no objection to steps such as are butlined in the plan.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> asked how he thought these democratic processes could be created. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> replied that if it could not be done then we could not make any progress toward reunification. There would be no way of proceeding. He could not accept any method which would turn the German people over to Communist rule.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that he could understand <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName>’s point about the danger of having a constitution drafted by a non-representative group in which Communists had a say. But supposing this constitution-drafting proposal were dropped, would the Germans then rule out closer contacts between East Germans and West Germans?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> replied that they had always tried to increase contacts between the Federal Republic and the Soviet Zone. They strove to promote freedom of movement. They would welcome anything which could be done to do away with the obstacles and handicaps which separated Germans in the Federal Republic and in the Zone. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> then asked whether the German objection to the all-German committee provided for in the Phased Plan applied only to the question of the constitution. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> agreed that was their main objection, but that they also disliked the Laender competency feature.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then turned the discussion to the question of whether to table a peace treaty or the principles of a peace treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said this really broke down into two questions. Should we table a peace treaty? If so, what should be in it?</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> summarized the U.S. position. It seemed clear that the Soviet Union would insist on discussing a peace treaty. We felt that <pb xml:id="pg_560" n="560" facs="0585"/>we would be in a stronger position if we had a peace treaty of our own from which to talk rather than being forced to discuss a Soviet draft. This would seem to leave the initiative to the Soviets and put us in a poor and defensive public posture. We could either table a draft or principles of a peace treaty on the understanding that when there was an agreement in principle we would table a draft.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that frankly he was not sure that we should put ourselves in the position of discussing a peace treaty. We would find ourselves talking about the possibility of a peace treaty with two Germanies. What would be the purpose of a peace treaty? Almost all the questions involved in such a treaty have been regulated by agreements between the Western Powers and the Federal Republic on one hand and the USSR and the Soviet Zone on the other. Only two questions remain to be settled. They are frontiers and the military status of Germany. So long as there are two Germanies we cannot discuss these questions.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> pointed out that we have now agreed to go to a conference at which a peace treaty will be discussed. There would be a tactical advantage in presenting a draft. We would not be able to evade the discussion of a treaty. There would be a spurious advantage appealing to the uninformed if we had our own draft.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> explained that we would naturally be agreed that there would be only one treaty with one Germany. There would be some appeal in comparing what we have to offer to what the USSR has offered.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> expressed his concern about a peace treaty which went into details. This would bring about a discussion which would certainly be to the disadvantage of the future all-German government. He thought it much better to state principles. The first of these principles would be that only a democratically constituted all-German government could speak for the German people and conduct negotiations on their behalf. It was much better to focus public attention on this point than to permit this question to be set to one side while discussions go on about details on a peace settlement. He agreed, however, that we would obviously have to discuss the question of a peace settlement. He thought the advantage lay on the side of presenting a statement of principles. The best subject on which to center an argument with the USSR on this subject was the question who will be the German partner. If it were a question of stating general principles these could be extracted <pb xml:id="pg_561" n="561" facs="0586"/>from the Bonn Conventions<note n="4" xml:id="d249fn4">For texts of the conventions signed at Bonn on May 26, 1952, see <ref target="frus1952-54v07p1"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. VII, Part 1</ref>, pp. 111 ff.</note> with the exception of the question of frontiers and military status.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> asked whether a statement of principles could deal with the question of frontiers. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Herr von Brentano</persName> replied that this was a very difficult internal question. Moreover, the Federal Republic obviously could not bind an all-German government. But the Federal Government could state with the approval of the Bundestag that it was ready to make guarantees to its Eastern neighbors that it would not use force in the settlement of any questions outstanding between them and to enter into discussions with them on these questions. This could lead to the opening of diplomatic relations between the Federal Republic and the countries to the east of it. This plan had been outlined at the first meeting of the Working Group.</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then circulated a draft statement to the press<note n="5" xml:id="d249fn5">Not printed. (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1226)</note> which was accepted by the Group with minor amendments. The meeting was adjourned until 10:30 a.m. the following day.</p>

<p>The Acting Secretary began the meeting by suggesting that the Ministers should, during the course of the day, agree on (a) a Minute of the four Foreign Ministers giving further direction to the work of the Four-Power Working Group, (b) a report to the North Atlantic Council on the Western position in a meeting with the Soviets, and (c) a communiqué.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary then raised the question of the extent to which we considered that the Russians were ready to enter into a serious negotiation, particularly with respect to the reunification of Germany. The answer to this question had special importance as concerns public opinion in our own country and in the rest of the world. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> responded that the British estimate was that the Soviets would be disposed to do business at a Foreign Ministers’ meeting if they were reasonably certain it would be followed by a meeting at the Summit. If the Soviets did not have that conviction they were likely to take unilateral action in matters concerning Berlin and to break off the Foreign Ministers’ Conference without serious negotiation. On the whole, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> considered that the Soviets would come to the meeting intending to have a serious discussion of the items in the agreed-upon agenda. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> stressed the importance of avoiding public sessions of the Ministers and refraining from handing speeches at the Foreign Ministers’ Conference to the press.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_563" n="563" facs="0588"/>
<p>The Acting Secretary expressed his agreement that the Foreign Ministers’ meeting should not become a public spectacle.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> suggested that we must not play with the idea that the Foreign Ministers’ Conference would be an empty ritual. He was convinced that the Soviets were ready to be serious. The question was what we were likely to be discussing with the Soviets. As he saw it, the first discussion would center on the question of Polish and Czechoslovak participation. This would be followed, he thought, by a general discussion making clear the position of each side on German problems. This brought us back to the matter of the Working Group Report.<note n="1" xml:id="d250fn1">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> The Soviets plainly do not accept reunification on any terms acceptable to the West. We could not accept any regime which acknowledged the permanent partition of Germany. The problem was therefore how we reach an acceptable modus vivendi with the Soviets. We need some kind of arrangement about Berlin, and something in the military field. We must be prepared to be in a position to expand our ideas on a possible German settlement. Our position must be so stated as to demonstrate that we are not being negative.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary pointed out that an interim solution for Berlin was required if it was expected that the reunification process was to take place in stages over a three-year period. He then asked the German Foreign Minister if he was ready to describe his ideas of a suitable reunification plan which the Minister had promised to provide following his criticism of the reunification portion of the Working Group Report.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said he had not had much time to develop his thought in detail and what he was about to present should not be considered as the last word. He recapitulated the ideas he had advanced yesterday<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">See <ref target="#d249">Document 249</ref>. A memorandum submitted by the German Delegation on the preliminary steps to the reunification of Germany, which follows the lines laid out here by <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>, is in Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/4–159.</note> by saying the idea of a mixed commission to prepare elections was a good concept. It went a certain distance to meet two fundamental Soviet points, namely that reunification was a matter for the two Germanies and that free elections could be the first step in the reunification processes.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said (1) that the mixed commission must be kept distinct from any idea of the “confederation” of the two Germanies, (2) that the principle of parity between the two sections of the mixed commission must be rejected because this violated fundamental democratic principles and (3) that the function of the commission should be limited to preparation for free elections. The mixed commission could, however, make proposals for increasing technical contacts between the two <pb xml:id="pg_564" n="564" facs="0589"/>parts of Germany and could study how the human rights articles of the Soviet draft peace treaty could be implemented. The important thing was that the commission should not have any executive or administrative functions. Finally, the composition and functions of the commission had to be considered with extreme care because the commission would have a decisive influence on the working out of reunification.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> thought that the selection of the members of the commission should not be left, in effect, to the East German Volkskammer on the one hand, and the West German Laender parliaments on the other. This method of choice was invidious to the Bundestag of the Federal Republic. It was better to envisage the selection of the members of the mixed commission on the one hand by the Government of the Federal Republic, and on the other by the authorities of the so-called German Democratic Republic.</p>
<p>If the mixed commission, so constituted, had the right to make proposals as to increased contacts between the two parts of Germany for the protection of human rights and freedoms, this would force both parts of Germany to take a position on these questions and would put up to the Soviet Zone authorities the need to make their views on these questions known.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said that the idea of an all-German committee as envisaged in the Working Group report was not a happy one, nor was the notion of the Laender selecting nominees for the Committee, particularly since the Laender in the Soviet Zone existed only on paper. Moreover, the selection of, for example, five nominees from Laender with a population of 5,000,000 provided too little representation and could easily produce accidental results.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said that the commission should have the task of preparing an election law. The election must be genuinely free. The Commission could not be entrusted with guaranteeing the freedom of the election. This should be the task of the United Nations. The West should not be concerned about putting forward maximum demands, for public opinion would understand the reasonableness of the Western position. If we come forward with minimum requests on our side we will have lost our room for maneuver. The Federal Republic would further elaborate its ideas on the reunification process and would give them to the Working Group as soon as the Federal Cabinet had approved them. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said he would like to make two further observations: (1) that it was extremely important that the West present its proposals as a package. There should be no dealing with isolated problems. (2) That his thoughts on the reunification processes were preliminary only and would be supplemented by more definitive German proposals.</p>

<p>The Acting Secretary said we would, of course, wish to examine the German proposals in greater detail, and asked if what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> had sketched out was to be accomplished in one phase or in several phases. To this, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> explained that his proposals were a part of the package. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> raised the question of when it could be expected that the Federal Cabinet would approve the German reunification proposal. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said that he expected to see the Chancellor on April 8.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary raised the question of the disassociation of the global disarmament portion of the Working Group report from the problem of Germany. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that the Working Group report covered two kinds of disarmament proposals. The first was general disarmament, and the second was specific measures in a special security area comprising Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and perhaps Hungary. The idea of some general disarmament, expressed as a limitation on the forces of the Four Powers, appears in all three stages of the Working Group Plan. The limitation of forces is only a small part of the 1957 disarmament package. The Working Group report does not touch nuclear armaments, the question of control, or the limitation of conventional arms.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked what value there was in such an approach. He presumed it was for the benefit of public opinion but he did not think it was a very convincing proposition.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary said he understood the Germans were anxious to have regional disarmament limitations tied to global limitations.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked whether we could propose that during the various stages of German reunification disarmament discussions could be proceeding simultaneously, conceivably in a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> committee. This would have the effect of putting the reunification process in the general context of global disarmament and in this way phased progress towards both goals could be achieved. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> approved this idea. The Acting Secretary said we could examine it further.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said we must appear to have constructive proposals of our own on the subject of ceilings on forces and armaments. We must have something by way of proposals to draw fire from proposals for disengagement, for disengagement was a very dangerous idea which would inevitably lead to the neutralization of Germany.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> reverted to the various items in the Working Group report which singled out subjects which were part of the 1957 global disarmament package, and voiced objection to the inclusion in the Western negotiating package of any global limitation on the forces of the Four Powers.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> agreed. He thought discussion of disarmament should be put in a wider framework. He knew that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed that <pb xml:id="pg_566" n="566" facs="0591"/>the 81-nation United Nations body charged with the disarmament question was a hopeless proposition. We could make proposals for getting disarmament discussions started on a more sensible basis. The Acting Secretary then proposed, and it was agreed, that the Working Group should be charged with defining the relationship between disarmament and reunification.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that as concerns the forces in Central Europe, these were of two kinds: the national forces and the visiting forces. He considered that as concerned national forces, it might be well to propose that the limitations on German forces and arms should be those prescribed in the London and Paris accords. These limitations could apply to a reunified Germany. This proposal would make for a very good presentation to the Soviets.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> agreed that as concerned the measures in paragraphs 21 to 23 of the Working Group Report,<note n="3" xml:id="d250fn3">These paragraphs dealt with security measures.</note> this was a good proposal, but he asked whether the inspection system should not be made dependent on the implementation of Stage III. There was a danger in inspection being permitted to the Soviet Union until the completion of Stage III. The Acting Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s proposal was logical, but he did not see how it fitted into the proposal for German reunification.</p>
<p>Discussion then turned to Berlin, and the interim arrangements for Berlin proposed in the Working Group Report. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said the problem was what we say on Berlin in presenting our proposals. He thought we should not say much since Berlin was a part of the package and its special status would disappear with the reunification of Germany. We must have interim solutions for difficulties which may arise during the stages of the reunification process, and we should be prepared to consider adjustments during that period. The real problem, however, is finding a modus vivendi for Berlin in the absence of reunification. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed with the Working Group analysis that Four Power control was better than <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control in Berlin; that any solution must guarantee continued freedom of access; that there should be no modification of the rights of access; and that the West could accept the substitution of the East German authorities if the Soviets explicitly made them their agents.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> agreed with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and said that the legal basis of the Western position must continue to rest on the conquest of Germany. We should not change this legal basis by any new agreement with the Soviets for three reasons:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_567" n="567" facs="0592"/>
<list type="participants">
<head>1. Any new agreement would be subject to interpretation and the consequent familiar erosion of our position by the technique of Soviet “interpretation”;</head>
<item>2. For any new arrangements the Soviets would demand the participation of the Soviet Zone authorities;</item>
<item>3. The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> guarantee for Berlin was valid only on the basis of the existing position. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> might not be ready to extend its guarantee if new arrangements were entered into with the Soviets.</item>
</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said all this depended on what sort of a new treaty we could get. The Soviets and the East German regime had the power to make the Western position awkward, without any specific hostile act. Our position was quite unsatisfactory, for the Communists had the power to interfere with life in Berlin in many ways. The question was, therefore, whether we could improve our present position. We should at least try to do so. Rights based on conquest gave a good title but the question was for how many generations would it remain a good title. From the point of view of public opinion should we not now offer to enter into new arrangements in order to put the Soviets a little more on the defensive. We should make it clear that we were not abandoning our rights based on conquest but we were willing to talk about a new status. This would have distinct public opinion advantages. We might consider how <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel could be used to supervise the new arrangements.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said he saw no contradiction between his views and those of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>. We must continue to maintain the existing legal basis for our rights, but we could come to an agreement as to how those rights were to be exercised. In this we could show some flexibility. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said we must have new ideas on reunification and a new plan for Berlin. We must appear to have a positive approach.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> was talking about West Berlin only, or all Berlin, in his suggestion for a new status. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he would start with Berlin as a whole and then fall back to a new status for West Berlin.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary asked how it was possible to maintain the legal concept that our rights were based on occupation and at the same time to appear to be giving them up. He also asked what the situation would be as concerns the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> guarantee in the new arrangements envisaged.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> replied that he would hope <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would endorse the new status and extend its guarantee to it. As concerns the legal position he was sure that our draftsmen could take care of that point. The preamble to the new agreement could say that the Soviets reject the concept that the West has rights by conquest and that the West insisted on those rights. The new arrangement would be without prejudice to the position of either side, and we were therefore ready to negotiate a new arrangement which would not cancel out the existing legal status. As concerns <pb xml:id="pg_568" n="568" facs="0593"/>the problem of relationships with the East German regime, if a new arrangement were to be entered into, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had told the British that he did not consider it necessary that there be any direct relationship between the East German regime and the Federal Republic, nor was it necessary that there be a direct juridical relationship between the West and the East German regime.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary suggested that the British prepare a paper elaborating their ideas, and meanwhile the lawyers would look into the question of whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s proposal was legally feasible.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said we all agree that it would be better if we could keep the present legal status, and he would accept the <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggestion only as a fallback position. He inquired whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> wanted to begin negotiations with the Soviets on the new basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> replied that the prospect of the reunification of Germany had grown more remote. The West’s position in Berlin was, to say the least, inconvenient. Whenever the Soviets wished to be bloody minded they can choke off life in Berlin. We had to ask ourselves whether we could get more of an international presence in Berlin and get an international underwriting of the responsibility for keeping Berlin free. The idea of using <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel to ensure freedom of access would appeal to public opinion, and it would embarrass the Russians to be put in the position of refusing this proposal. The new arrangements need not extinguish our present rights.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> continued that the fact was that the present legal basis of our rights was flimsy. The agreement of 1949<note n="4" xml:id="d250fn4">For text of the final communiqué of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers, see <ref target="frus1949v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 1062–1065.</note> only ensured the return to the status quo—whatever that was. It is unclear what the civilian rights of the inhabitants of West Berlin are. Were these people the subjects of the occupying powers?</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary acknowledged that our present agreements were imprecise. He pointed out that in the 1948–1949 blockade we used these rights as justification for our supplying Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> responded that there was no doubt that the Russians had it in mind to constrict activity in Berlin by many methods, including the shutting off of raw materials. We must plan to do more than keep Berlin alive. The situation today was quite different from the situation in 1948 when Berlin was much less prosperous than it is today. The Acting Secretary proposed that the Working Group study the juridical position of the West.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said it was basically important that our rights were based upon conquest and not on agreements with the Soviet Union. This was not to say, however, that we could not make adjustments. We should be prepared to consider some limitations on our position in Berlin, as for <pb xml:id="pg_569" n="569" facs="0594"/>example, by a limitation on our forces in Berlin, and by restricting or eliminating some of our activities in Berlin. He cited specifically the periodic meetings of the Bundestag in Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that if the Soviets would underwrite that the East German regime would respect the new arrangements this would solve the problem of the physical association of the East German regime with the Western right of access.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary then said we might adopt the legal theory that the Russians, by signing a peace treaty with the East German regime, were abandoning their rights, and that these rights therefore reverted to the other Three Powers. There were elements in the United States Government which support this view. A logical consequence would be the installation of Western sentry posts to control access. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he doubted whether this idea would gain much acceptance.</p>
<p>Upon the question of the UN role in Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that he understood that the representatives of the Three Powers at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had made agreed recommendations. The Acting Secretary said that they had examined the role of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> only on a hypothetical basis. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that he had been informed by <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> recognizes that there could be no <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Berlin, for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> wouldn’t have the troops for it.<note n="5" xml:id="d250fn5">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName>’s visit to Moscow, see <ref target="#d246fn2">footnote 2, Document 246</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that the problem of paying for the troops was serious.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> envisaged the stage at which the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be brought into the problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> replied that this depended on what we want the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to do. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> considered it would be dangerous to bring the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> into the problem, because once the affair is in the hands of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> it would be difficult to predict what would happen. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> considered that if the Russians surrendered their rights and obligations it would be a good idea to substitute <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> posts for controlling access. This would be a sound public position, although <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> certainly wouldn’t accept it. The Acting Secretary remarked that he would be glad to see the specific proposals of the British in this regard. He pointed out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was of the opinion that we could not negotiate a new arrangement for Berlin without effectively losing our rights based on conquest. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> suggested that the Working Group must study the threat to the communications of the civilian population of Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> repeated that West Berlin was geographically surrounded and physically isolated. He did not want to end up with a self-imposed blockade. If there was to be a military operation to free Berlin it was most important for the public to understand that we had tried everything before resorting to force.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_570" n="570" facs="0595"/>
<p>The Acting Secretary then reverted to the question of the introduction of a peace treaty in the negotiation with the Soviets. He said that the United States was prepared to agree that the principles of a peace treaty should be offered, and if they should be accepted we would then table the draft of a treaty. To this the other Ministers agreed.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 12:20 p.m.</p>

<p>The afternoon session of the April 1 four Foreign Ministers meeting (U.S., U.K., France and the Federal Republic of Germany) was taken up almost entirely with discussion of 4 papers: The session opened with a renewed injunction regarding security and not revealing to the press anything which transpired in the meeting. There was some consternation evident over a detailed article in the afternoon <hi rend="italic">Washington Star</hi> under the headline “Ministers Get Bonn Warning” (not to take too soft a line with the Soviets).</p>
<p>The four papers discussed were:<note n="1" xml:id="d251fn1">U.S. drafts of these four papers, April 1, are <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1225.

<list>
<item>1. a joint communiqué;</item>
<item>2. an agreed minute, which contains formal instructions to the Working Group for its next meeting;</item>
<item>3. a report to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on the Western position on German Reunification, European Security and Berlin;</item>
<item>4. a report to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on Contingency Planning.</item>
</list>
<p>The communiqué was largely non-substantive in nature. It announced that the Working Group will reconvene in London April 13, have a report ready by April 25 for consideration by the next four Foreign Ministers meeting in Paris April 29.</p>
<p>There were several interesting substantive exchanges on the language of the Minute, particularly involving British views on European security and the linking of security to German reunification. The British proposed that the group consider measures in the field of security without this link. They saw the possibility of having to consider reunification in connection with Berlin, for example, or as a completely separate issue. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> stressed that he was speaking only of very limited European security measures and not of disengagement.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Minister announced that he had had second thoughts on the whole concept of a special security area. He felt this smacked too much of the Rapacki Plan.<note n="2" xml:id="d251fn2">See <ref target="#d43fn2">footnote 2, Document 43</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> stated he was not rejecting a special area altogether but was notifying the group that he had not yet made up his mind on the whole concept.</p>
<p>The French, joined by the Germans and the US, opposed the British effort to separate out European security so that it could be considered by itself. Compromise language was agreed to which maintained the link between reunification of Germany and European security.</p>
<p>The Germans objected to the paragraph of the Minute (which the French had proposed) suggesting that the Working Group study the <pb xml:id="pg_572" n="572" facs="0597"/>possible application of the limitations of the protocols to the Brussels Treaty to a reunified Germany. It was agreed to drop the paragraph. The German position appeared based on the fear that this provision would become public knowledge and that it would have an unfortunate effect (mostly on German public opinion). The Germans noted that they did not object to consideration of this subject in the Working Group but did not want it mentioned in the Minute.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> declared that the link between the discussion of general disarmament and German reunification made the Western package proposals less negotiable. The subjects could be discussed simultaneously or in parallel but he did not think the two should be linked. The Acting Secretary pointed out that the link was based partly on the fact that if the Soviets agreed to the principle of reunification it would make possible much more rapid progress toward general disarmament. The French suggested language to remove the link between disarmament and reunification.</p>
<p>The question whether to submit a draft peace treaty at the May 11 Foreign Ministers meeting or only the principles governing a peace treaty was discussed. It was agreed the Working Group should try, if practicable, to draft a peace treaty. The principles for a draft treaty would be tabled. The tabling of a draft treaty was a matter for further consideration.</p>
<p>The next document discussed was the Report to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on the Western position. The principal problems discussed were how much to tell <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the specific language they would use. The Report to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> follows a standard pattern. It goes into more detail on German reunification and European security than has been given to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> before. It adds nothing new on Berlin. The discussion of the Report was somewhat repetitious in order to bring it into harmony with the language of the Agreed Minute. It was agreed that proposals on the method of reunification of Germany should be part of the Western package. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested language to indicate flexibility whereby Stage I of the reunification plan might be put forward alone if the Soviets rejected the rest of the plan. This was opposed by all three other Ministers. The Acting Secretary declared the several stages went together as a unit.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> agreed that we should put the package forward as our first position. He only wanted to know what we would do if, as he felt likely, the Russians rejected the package. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> objected to giving <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> any fall-back positions to consider at this time, principally because of the danger of leaks. He did not exclude considering possible fall-back positions later, principally in return for concessions on Berlin. The Germans objected strongly to anything limited to Stage I which did not contain a timetable setting forth when the next Stage was to take effect.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_573" n="573" facs="0598"/>
<p>On the European security section of the Report to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> there was considerable discussion of the language, as was also true for the Minute. The French repeated their previous objections to the special security area; the Germans objected to having language on the non-transfer of the custody of nuclear weapons. There was some feeling among the other delegations that there might be some confusion in the minds of the Germans as to the actual effects of this provision. The section in the Report to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on the draft German Peace Treaty was changed to make it conform to the Minute.</p>
<p>The section on Berlin was extremely skimpy. The French pointed out that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> already received more from the Working Group at its last session in Paris than the Report gave them. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> read the three points given <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> by the Working Group: (1) that a quadripartite solution on Berlin was preferable to a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> solution; (2) any solution must allow the West to retain forces in Berlin and maintain access; (3) our position in Berlin must continue to be based upon our right of conquest. The British had trouble with both 1 and 3. They could see the possibility that a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> solution might be necessary. They thought the passages about our rights of conquest were too flat a statement and foresaw some possibility of a contractual arrangement. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> pointed out that the Working Group Report to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had not been a Governmental statement. Compromise language was worked out to cover this point.</p>
<p>The Report to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on Contingency Planning was accepted with only one minor change.</p>
<p>The Ministers further developed an agreed formula on how and at what stage Italy would be invited to participate as an observer or as a full member in the Foreign Ministers meeting of May 11 or a subsequent Summit meeting. It was agreed that the information would be conveyed to Italian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> orally.<note n="3" xml:id="d251fn3"><persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> briefed Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> at 9 a.m. on April 2; a summary of their conversation was transmitted to Rome in telegram 3353, April 2. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/4–259)</note></p>
<p>The method of presenting the reports to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on Thursday was discussed and agreed to. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> will present the report on the Western position and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> will report on Contingency Planning.</p>
<p>The meeting ended at 5:50 p.m.</p>

<p>U.K. took floor again to give present British thinking regarding Germany-Berlin problems. Agreeing in general with U.S. résumé of world situation; <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said it was necessary to look into future and to try to devise ways of avoiding “a situation of choice between war and a resounding diplomatic defeat”. He made following points:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_575" n="575" facs="0600"/>
<list>
<item>(a) U.K. believes Soviet leaders have basically more to lose from relaxation of tension than West has. While USSR has made remarkable progress in certain fields, their system has failed in providing human wellbeing. Therefore, any relaxation of tensions will tend to accentuate pressures upon Soviet leadership to devote more resources to human needs;</item>
<item>(b) Nevertheless, British leaders convinced by recent trip that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> genuinely wants negotiations, certainly on Berlin;</item>
<item>(c) U.K. favors Summit meeting after Foreign Ministers conference, because: (1) they convinced <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> alone can make major decisions; (2) Soviets unlikely act unilaterally on Berlin if Summit meeting in prospect; (3) public opinion will demand Summit meeting before being willing undertake preparations for war.</item>
<item>(d) Re Germany and Berlin, U.K. position is that West must be firm in protecting Berlin’s right to freedom; West must avoid a neutralized Germany; West must avoid “disengagement” in sense of any pulling apart of forces, discrimination against forces of any country, or discrimination in weapons. West must avoid any security disadvantages in considering ideas in security field. UK does, however, see advantages in inspection in an agreed zone as providing precedent favorable to West, and some safeguard against surprise attack.</item>
<item>(e) On question German unification, UK had no new thoughts, but considers method of presentation needs careful study.</item>
<item>(f) On Berlin, optimum, of course, is Berlin as capital of reunified Germany, but UK recognizes that West’s position in Berlin extremely exposed, and existing arrangements vague and tenuous. Rights of occupation, although legally sound, not publicly convincing in UK view. UK thinks West should take good look at status quo and determine whether some new and better basis for protection Berlin’s freedom cannot be worked out without abandoning present legal basis. These preliminary thoughts on which UK seeks views its Allies.</item>
</list>
<p>France (<persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>) gave general exposé French position, emphasizing France believes that USSR wishes negotiate both on Berlin and Germany rather than fight. France believes present situation grave and tense, but stresses that tension created by Soviets who are aiming for two legal entities in Germany. Stressed military confidence USSR, noted that while this not a good basis for conference, it nevertheless evident that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wants to negotiate at Summit.</p>
<p>Taking considerably tougher line than <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said manner in which Soviet challenge on Berlin was made requires absolute firmness and resolution in West. Further, Berlin’s exposed position makes a firm Western response doubly necessary. Stressing difficulty and danger of detailing successive Western positions, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> warned against going much beyond Western Four report at this stage. Defined points on which France thinks can be no compromise:</p>
<p>(1) Maintenance of Western garrisons in Berlin, stressing absolute need to hold to present legal basis of occupying powers; (2) avoidance any step leading to de jure recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_576" n="576" facs="0601"/>
<p>France supports keeping <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> well informed, as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> support in this situation very important.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> indicated that he would wish to speak April 3. The Chairman suggested discussion be adjourned until April 3 to give opportunity for reflection and preparation of views.</p>

<p>1149. From US <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Del. <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> Ministerial session morning April 3<note n="1" xml:id="d253fn1">The verbatim record of this session, <gloss target="#t_CVR1">C–VR</gloss>(59)14, April 3, is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1237.</note> devoted entirely to continuation discussion Germany and Berlin under first agenda item.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> (Germany) stressed West would be wrong to show optimism regarding alleged Soviet desire to negotiate. Nevertheless Western public opinion expects governments make every effort to keep peace through negotiations. Western Powers must agree on limits beyond which they cannot go. If three Western Powers gave up legal basis their position in Berlin, freedom of all Europe would eventually be involved. As <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had asked yesterday<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">See <ref target="#d252">Document 252</ref>.</note> “If Berlin falls today who would be the next victim?”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> was glad that unanimity reached by four Ministers that there could be no peace treaty with two Germanies as proposed by Soviets. He hesitated to propose counter-draft to Soviet peace treaty draft. He felt it better to put forward principles including who to represent Germany at peace treaty negotiations. As to reunification point must be stressed that division of Germany was not cause but expression of world tensions. Therefore, isolated solution to German problem not <pb xml:id="pg_577" n="577" facs="0602"/>possible and Western proposals must be submitted as package. Agreement on controlled disarmament would be of decisive importance to solution German problem.</p>
<p>As to UK statement yesterday, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> continued, he was glad that any idea disengagement or neutralization of Germany was rejected but he could not accept British idea creation of limited security zone. Such zone unacceptable if not accompanied by political progress.</p>
<p>If Soviets progressively withdrawing from ultimatum on Berlin this was because of firmness shown by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in December.<note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">Regarding the discussion of Berlin by the Council on December 16, see <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>. For text of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> declaration on Berlin, December 16, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, January 5, 1959, p. 4.</note> It would be tactically dangerous to buy through concessions, as suggested by UK, right of Western Powers to protect Berlin.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> (Italy) noted difficulty reaching any results on specific problems during first meeting Foreign Ministers with Soviets, but it was urgent Berlin problem be settled and evidence given of sincere effort by West to reach peaceful solutions. Western countries must be firm and not concede questions of principle; concessions not involving principle should be counter-balanced by equivalent Soviet concessions.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> said report on behalf four Ministers to Ministerial Council did not mention how Berlin problem should be handled with Soviets. This must have priority in Western preparations. Regarding control of traffic, West must avoid giving impression we were ready to risk war on purely procedural matter. <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> also stressed that West cannot abandon position that German solution must at some point involve free manifestation of will of people, although it might be useful to follow up suggestion made yesterday of establishment some temporary all-German body to promote contacts between East and West Germany. <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> expressed skepticism regarding any special zone of security in Europe. If such zone to be established it must involve effective controls, and area proportionate to strategic concern of all governments involved.</p>
<p>Pearkes (Canada) laid down principle that war no longer a legitimate extension of policy under contemporary conditions. To succeed in negotiations with Soviets West must know minds of adversary. This now more clear in view <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> visit to Moscow. Soviets obviously want to advance their interests, which are contrary to West, but not at price of nuclear war. West must also know its own mind. Canada agreed that we could not jeopardize freedom and security West Berlin, ties of Federal Republic with Western Europe, or abandonment of German reunification. However despite undoubted legal basis position Western troops in Berlin, Canada saw inadequacies in present system which <pb xml:id="pg_578" n="578" facs="0603"/>lacks fundamental international instrument guaranteeing security of city and freedom of access thereto, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] West should therefore not start with assumption that any change in status quo necessarily for worse. Four-Power agreement on Berlin involving <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might stabilize situation. Permanent <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council should study possibility of (a) role of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in verifying that all parties abiding by terms of agreement, (b) Soviet pledge to permit freedom of access along with acceptance of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence. Any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> responsibility for West Berlin would be complementary to present responsibility of Four Occupying Powers.</p>
<p>If negotiations broader than Berlin take place, Canada saw little prospect for any agreement on reunification. Continuing commission to supervise and promote progress toward reunification might be useful. West should also accept some arms and forces limitation with inspection and control in portion of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Iron Curtain area. Some mutually profitable measures of redeployment would benefit both sides and West should not reject out-of-hand possibility such arrangements.</p>
<p>Krag (Denmark) reiterated need for both firmness and willingness to negotiate with patience. West should consider creation at conference of body of experts comprising Four Occupying Powers, supplemented by <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> advisers, to examine ways and means to enable further negotiations at governmental level. Existence such body would tend to prevent dangerous incidents.</p>
<p>Wigny (Belgium) made long rambling statement, main point of which was to show that while Western principles must be firmly held regarding reunification and maintenance of rights in Berlin, this should not preclude acceptance fact of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> existence and need for certain Western adaptations thereto. He apparently gave qualified approval to UK approach on limited security arrangements, noting that Western public opinion desired this.</p>
<p>Lange (Norway) conceded difficulty consultation with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> of Powers primarily responsible but expressed hope views of other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries would be taken into consideration in development position. While West could not accept neutralization of Germany or withdrawal US, UK, and Canadian forces from Europe, Soviets could be given somewhat more far-reaching security guarantees than in 1955.<note n="4" xml:id="d253fn4">For documentation on the Western security proposals submitted to the Foreign Ministers meeting in 1955, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, vol. V</ref>, pp. 537 ff.</note> He agreed with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> that limited security arrangements would be feasible involving arms and forces ceilings and inspection controls in central European zone. This must not upset present military balance or jeopardize Western security. Lange also supported UK idea that certain new arrangements <pb xml:id="pg_579" n="579" facs="0604"/>would strengthen Western position in Berlin and enable continuance of presence there. Also thought possibility of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role should be considered.</p>
<p>Canellopoulos (Greece) stressed that any important concession to Communism represented defeat of democracy. Despite great financial problems, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries must continue vigorous defense efforts.</p>
<p>Luns (Netherlands) noted he had presented his general views at opening session yesterday. He expressed gratitude for information received regarding tripartite contingency planning and concurred in conclusions of report. However, information given Council regarding Western position at conference was not very substantial, and more detailed information needed if support public opinion to be obtained.</p>
<p>Zorlu (Turkey) emphasized broad Soviet objective of world domination and that Soviets would continue to pursue this goal despite any local arrangements made. He supported general policy of firmness as only way of reducing Soviet intransigence. He opposed any special security zones without general disarmament as only leading to false confidence.</p>
<p>In concluding remarks <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said he had mixed feelings at end of morning’s discussion, Many interesting statements had been made, but he was concerned that they did not really reply to one another. There obviously were certain divergencies between certain members. While it possible to distinguish countries directly interested from other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and to accept this distinction for practical and procedural reasons, entire <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> organization was involved in Berlin situation through common commitments. Situation could not be allowed to arise whereby, if discussions with Soviets a failure and this failure led to need for practical decisions <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries could complain that they were not sufficiently consulted.</p>
<p>He noted that there was complete agreement on a number of points, such as no reunification without free elections, no neutralization of Germany, no abandonment of West Berlin, and no US-UK-Canadian withdrawal from continent. Beyond this however clarification of several points was necessary:</p>
<list>
<item>a) Was acceptance by Soviets of free election principle necessary before any of phased plan could go into effect? If so, this obviously unacceptable to Soviets. Yet West has said Berlin question must be discussed as part of whole complex. If no solution found to broader problem, Berlin problem would be put to West in isolated manner.</item>
<item>b) Reference had been made to package proposals but not made clear whether progress in security field had to be tied to reunification under all circumstances. Would Soviets have to accept parcel all at once or could there be a number of little parcels?</item>
<item>c) He believed that stress on peace treaty at this time strangely anachronistic.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_580" n="580" facs="0605"/>
<item>d) After noting apparent difference between views that Western Powers should stand on their rights in Berlin or attempt to improve those rights, he concluded that merely adding something to what already existed did not involve real issue.</item>
<item>e) If Berlin problem forced into <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, whether or not Western Powers willing, rigid insistence on legal basis must be put in such a way as to obtain <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> support. He did not favor emphasis on rights flowing from occupation or conquest, especially if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> involved and there was need to find another formula. It would be best to obtain <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> guarantee of any agreement reached rather than have organization attempt settle problem possibly via General Assembly discussion.</item>
</list>
<p>Session ended at this point, with possibility left often [<hi rend="italic">open?</hi>] for Foreign Ministers to discuss specific points raised by <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> at afternoon meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d253fn5">In the discussion in the afternoon session on April 3 the other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries expressed a desire for the closest consultation between the four Western powers and the Council on Germany and it was agreed that the Working Group and the four Ministers would report to the Council at the end of April.

</list>
<p>The Acting Secretary said he would like to speak frankly. We had studied the paper tabled by the Germans at the quadripartite ministerial <pb xml:id="pg_581" n="581" facs="0606"/>meeting on Wednesday<note n="1" xml:id="d254fn1">See <ref target="#d250fn2">Document 250 and footnote 2</ref> thereto.</note> and it left us wondering. It seemed to contain little more than negatives. It was difficult to see how the Working Group could provide an attractive package with appeal to public opinion on the basis of such a paper, or even how the phased plan could be maintained. The Acting Secretary said he hoped that, as soon as possible, the German Government would come up with something more precise so that the Working Group could have something to begin on. The Acting Secretary said he knew, from a luncheon conversation with the German Foreign Minister,<note n="2" xml:id="d254fn2">The conversation has not been identified further.</note> that the latter was conscious of the fact that the German paper was negative. It appeared that the Western Powers were now at a standstill as far as the preparation of their position was concerned.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> agreed that the German paper was predominately negative. However he felt that it was realistic. He thought it fallacious solely to emphasize that West Germany had more than 50 million people, as compared with the 17 million people in East Germany, and therefore should exercise much greater attraction in terms of its flourishing economy and comparative advantages. Those who said this did not really know how a totalitarian system operated, with its monolithic purposes opposed to the divisive forces within a democratic system. Therefore, he did not think there was a possibility of doing much more than suggested in the German paper if the risk of Communization of all of Germany were to be averted. If the recent proposals made by the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss><note n="3" xml:id="d254fn3">Reference is to the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> “Plan for Germany” approved by the party on March 18 and released to the press the following day. The Embassy in Bonn transmitted the text of the plan as an enclosure to despatch 1440, March 23. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/3–2359) For text, see <hi rend="italic">Dokumente</hi>, Band 1, 1958–1959, Zweiter Halbband, pp. 1207–1222.</note> (which, of course, went beyond the working group report) were to be accepted, then he could personally guarantee that, within 5 years, Germany would at least be at the stage of Communization reached by Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>It was difficult to find an acceptable interim approach, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> continued. This would involve an attempt to synthesize fire and water. The basic differences between the two systems were too great. The Pankow regime did not want to work together with the Federal Republic, but aimed at the subversion of all Germany. Behind this regime stood the Soviets. While differences in the social and economic fields could perhaps be overcome, the cleavage in the cultural and spiritual fields was too great.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary noted that, perhaps the point at which our thinking diverged most was that we were more optimistic as to the <pb xml:id="pg_582" n="582" facs="0607"/>basic strength of West Germany. We believed that a point had been reached where the West Germans would resist Communistic blandishments. From all the information available to us, and in terms of our own estimates, the Federal Republic was apparently stronger that its own Government thought it to be. We had great faith in the strength of a free system.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said that what would follow he would not say gladly. He also felt that we must get out of the present deadlock. However, the Federal Republic had a great responsibility for the 50 million people in West Germany and must most carefully consider to what it could afford to commit itself. Present German leaders had lived through one totalitarian regime and had experienced how incapable Democracy is of resisting a totalitarian drive to power. It was not the Government that was weak, but the people. It was not really a question of there only being 17 million people in East Germany. The Red Army was still there. Acceptance of reunification would in effect mean suicide for the officials of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. They would not concede this as long as the Red Army remained there. One spoke too lightly of contacts, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said. For example, take the question of contacts in the field of justice. The concept of justice in the two Germanies was entirely different. Eighty-five percent of the judges in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> were so-called “Peoples Judges.” The whole structure of the Soviet Zone had changed completely, and any attempts at integration would mean subversion of the West. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> indicated he would have nothing fundamentally against trying out those ideas which could be safely carried put. For example, reciprocity relative to freedom of movement would be highly desirable. There is already freedom of movement into the Federal Republic from the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, but the Pankow regime is not prepared to permit its own inhabitants to leave freely. However, he felt that any institutionalization would necessarily involve great dangers. Perhaps the Acting Secretary was correct in saying that the Federal Republic undervalued its own strength. This was better than to overestimate it. [<hi rend="italic">8 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary said that, if it were granted that the Federal Republic had a difficult problem and feared the possibility of a coalition between the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> and East German elements, he wondered how the German Foreign Minister envisaged the resulting situation in terms of long range solutions. Did he foresee a change in the internal political situation with the opposition moving away from the extreme left, or did he hope for a cultural change?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> once again said that he would not say gladly what was to follow. He had already hinted yesterday, in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting,<note n="4" xml:id="d254fn4">See <ref target="#d253">Document 253</ref>.</note> that any attempt to deal with the German problem in <pb xml:id="pg_583" n="583" facs="0608"/>isolation would bring more dangers than opportunities. It would be better to preserve the status quo for some time than to change it by entering into risks that were not calculable. Perhaps such a development as a first step towards disarmament might change the situation by lowering tensions and reducing Soviet insistence on keeping the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as an integral part of the Soviet bloc. It was not pleasant for a German to have to say this, but he felt the German problem was regarded as sort of a lock on the door which everyone was trying to open in order to escape from situations of tension.</p>
<p>The Germans recognized their responsibility for what had happened prior to 1945. What happened after 1945 was not their fault. It was out of their reach to change the division of Germany.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary commented that the problem was described in the statement that it was out of practical reach to change anything. Basically the Federal Republic did not appear to want reunification, since there are no conditions it could foresee that would make it attractive. This created difficulties for the United States, since we have been supporting the German position for many years on the assumption that efforts to eliminate one of the causes of tension might lead to some sort of disarmament possibilities. We have said that the Berlin problem can be settled only in the context of the general German problem. We would now be confined to dealing only with Berlin.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said that he would report this discussion carefully and in detail. He fully recognized the difficulties with which we are faced. He understood that the Germans sometimes made big demands of their allies and he also saw that it was dangerous to go into a conference if public opinion could not be given the impression that the Western Powers were prepared to go one step forward.</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary said he felt the Soviets would win a bloodless victory of the first order if the Western Powers took the position that they did not want any political changes.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said that the United States had such an excellent Ambassador in Bonn that he would be interested in hearing his comments.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> stated that he thought we faced a practical problem. He agreed that it was unrealistic to think we could give up anything in West Germany to get real concessions from the Soviets. But because of the demands of the public we could not simply fall back on the old position of free elections. If we could agree on a package with a number of offers, even if the Soviets could not accept it, this would be good. The reversion to Geneva was unacceptable. What we must attempt to do is not to abandon principles, but to appear flexible in posture and tactics in order to bring about public understanding that it is the Soviets who are obstructing progress.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_584" n="584" facs="0609"/>
<p>After its session in London the Working Group would have to make a report to the Ministers. It could not get anywhere unless the delegations were clearly instructed. It was bad to have the German Delegation join in drafting papers only subsequently to be repudiated by its own government. The problem must be solved for if, when the Foreign Ministers meet again late in April, there are still decided differences, the Soviets would exploit them as they had in the past. As a practical matter, the Soviets would not surrender their position except to gain a position more favorable to them. The Working Group must have some latitude in drawing up its proposals, otherwise the West will enter the Geneva conference in a disorganized fashion. The Acting Secretary said he concurred with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>’s remarks. He said that, even if the four Foreign Ministers could agree, there was also the problem of dealing with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> noted that, practically, this meant the Federal Republic must put forward some further concrete proposals, perhaps in lieu of the Laender scheme, which would fit into the stages of the reunification process.<note n="5" xml:id="d254fn5">According to <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>’s Diary, he and <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> talked privately after this conversation and the German Ambassador said that he approved <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>’s remarks and thought they should also be made to the Chancellor. (Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D 327)</note> The Acting Secretary agreed in encouraging the Germans to produce something which would fall into place within the staged plan.</p>

<p rend="center">BERLIN CONTINGENCY PLANNING</p>
<p>[Here follow an introductory paragraph and a table of contents.]</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Preparatory Military Measures</p>
<p>a. In view of the possibility that the USSR may withdraw from its functions with respect to Berlin and in order to provide evidence of the <pb xml:id="pg_585" n="585" facs="0610"/>Three Powers’ determination to maintain their free access, the military authorities of the Three Powers will plan quiet preparatory and precautionary military measures of a kind which will not create public alarm but which will be detectable by Soviet intelligence. These measures are to be implemented as soon as they have been agreed.</p>
<p>b. The military authorities of the Three Powers will also plan more elaborate military measures in Europe, which would be generally observable, including (1) measures to be implemented after the Soviet Government has turned its functions over to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and (2) measures to be implemented after Allied traffic has been forcibly obstructed.</p>
<p>c. The planning of the measures described in paragraphs 1a and 1b above will be carried out on a tripartite basis under the general supervision of General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief, United States Forces, Europe. The exact arrangements for the planning will be further concerted between the military authorities of the three countries. These military authorities will also plan measures on a purely national basis in support of the measures referred to above.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Notice to Soviet Government</p>
<p>The Three Ambassadors in Moscow should inform the Soviet Government at an appropriate time (1) that the Three Powers continue to hold the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics fully responsible under quadripartite agreements and arrangements concerning Berlin; (2) that the Three Powers have noted Soviet statements to the effect that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will withdraw from its remaining occupation functions with respect to Berlin: that they assume this means the Soviets intend to withdraw Soviet personnel from the Interzonal autobahn and railway checkpoints and from the Berlin Air Safety Center; (3) that the right of the Three Powers to unrestricted access to Berlin would remain unaffected by such Soviet withdrawal; (4) that the Three Powers will not tolerate any attempt on the part of the “German Democratic Republic” to assert any control over or to interfere with their traffic to and from Berlin via quadripartitely established routes, and that they would take all measures necessary to protect their rights in this connection; (5) that, if the Soviets withdraw, the Western Powers will act on the assumption (a) that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has decided to abolish unnecessary administrative procedures at interzonal borders, and (b) the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics can and will, without benefit of exchange of flight information in the Berlin Air Safety Center, maintain absolute separation of Soviet aircraft and all other aircraft flying in the Soviet Zone from aircraft of the Three Powers flying in the Berlin corridors and the Berlin Control Zone; (6) that the Three Powers will expect their traffic to move freely to and from Berlin and will <pb xml:id="pg_586" n="586" facs="0611"/>assume the Soviets have given blanket assurance of safety of all Three Power aircraft in the Berlin corridors and the Berlin Control Zone.<note n="1" xml:id="d255fn1"><p>The notice to the Soviets contemplated in this paragraph has already been given in part by the Three Powers’ notes of December 31, 1958, which read in part as follows:</p>
<p>“As the Soviet Government knows, the French, British, and United States Governments have the right to maintain garrisons in their sectors of Berlin and to have free access thereto. Certain administrative procedures have been agreed with the Soviet authorities accordingly and are in operation at the present time. The Government (of the United States) will not accept a unilateral repudiation on the part of the Soviet Government of its obligations with respect of that freedom of access. Nor will it accept the substitution of the regime which the Soviet Government refers to as the German Democratic Republic for the Soviet Government in this respect.” [Footnote in the source text. Regarding the Western notes of December 31, 1958, see <ref target="#d118">Document 118</ref>.]</p></note></p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Public Statement</p>
<p>There will be drawn up without delay a tripartitely agreed draft of a public statement to be made if and when the Soviet Government announces the imminent turning over of the checkpoints to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. This statement would explain the legal construction which the Allied Governments place upon the Soviet announcement and the procedures they will follow.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">4. The “Agency Principle”</p>
<p>The Three Powers cannot deal with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel as Soviet agents if the USSR denies that such an agency relationship exists. If, however, the USSR should ultimately propose a compromise under which the USSR, as principal, would expressly authorize <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel to function as Soviet agents in performing Soviet functions with relation to the access of the Three Powers to Berlin, the Three Powers should consider the possibility of accepting such a compromise solution, with appropriate safeguards for their own rights.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Identification of Allied Vehicles</p>
<p>If Soviet personnel are withdrawn from the checkpoints, there would be no objection to providing mere identification of the vehicles of the Three Powers for the information of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel at the checkpoints.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Continuation of Allied Traffic after Soviet Withdrawal</p>
<p>If and when the Soviet personnel are withdrawn from the checkpoints, the Three Powers will make every effort to continue normal traffic by Autobahn and railroad, except that they will substitute for the procedures followed at present with the Soviet personnel those procedures which the Three Powers themselves have determined to be necessary to identify their trains, convoys, or vehicles as Allied movements <pb xml:id="pg_587" n="587" facs="0612"/>entitled to unrestricted access and whatever procedures may be tripartitely agreed to be reasonable to enable the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel to ensure the orderly progress of traffic on the Autobahn or railroad.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">7. Detailed Procedures at Checkpoints</p>
<p>The Three Embassies at Bonn, in consultation with the appropriate military headquarters, should complete the drafting of instructions to the commanders of military trains and convoys and to the drivers of individual vehicles regarding the procedures to be followed at the railroad and Autobahn checkpoints in the event of the withdrawal of Soviet checkpoint personnel. In drafting those instructions, provision will be made for a situation in which the Soviet Government has acknowledged the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel to be its agents and for a situation in which the Soviet Government has not done so. The Embassies, in consultation with the same military headquarters mentioned above, will also develop appropriate procedures for the identification of Allied movements and draft the above-mentioned instructions to conform with these procedures.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">8. Possible Substitution of Allied for Soviet Personnel</p>
<p>The Three Powers should consider the possibility of substituting their own personnel for the Soviet personnel withdrawn from the Nowawes and Marienborn checkpoints.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">9. Initial Probe of Soviet Intentions</p>
<p>If Allied surface access is interrupted as a result of an attempt by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel to enforce formalities or controls going beyond those which the Three Powers have determined to be acceptable (<gloss target="#t_CF1">cf</gloss>. paragraph 6 above), the Three Powers will then make a probe or probes to determine whether the Soviets are prepared to use force or to permit the use of force to prevent the passage of an Allied movement. The vehicles will be identified to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel in accordance with the procedures which the Three Powers have agreed on, but no further inspection or control will be allowed. The movement will proceed until its passage is physically obstructed. It will not fire unless fired upon, but if fired upon will take whatever defensive action seems necessary.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">10. Efforts to Increase Pressure on USSR and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss></p>
<p>If the initial probe or probes as described in paragraph 9 above are physically obstructed, the Three Powers will make parallel efforts along the following lines to increase pressure on the USSR and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>:</p>
<list>
<item>a. The Three Powers will seek to mobilize world opinion against the USSR as a violator of agreements, as a user of force, and as a threat to the peace. A possibility is that the situation could be taken to the United Nations Security Council and, perhaps in the event of a Soviet veto, to a special session of the General Assembly. Consideration would be given <pb xml:id="pg_588" n="588" facs="0613"/>to further forms of diplomatic or other pressure, including the withdrawal of the Ambassadors of the Three rowers from Moscow.</item>
<item>b. The Three Powers will intensify their military preparations. At this point the preparations could include measures which would be readily observable.</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">11. Use of Military Force</p>
<p>a. The Three Governments will make jointly the appropriate decisions for restoring freedom of passage. The measures required for their implementation should be the object of a study by the tripartite staff in Paris.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">See <ref target="#d227">Document 227</ref>,</note></p>
<p>b. Supplementing military decisions, consideration might be given to possible economic measures.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">12. Air Access to Berlin</p>
<p>a. As a concomitant to the above courses of action regarding surface access to Berlin, the Three Powers should, from the start, take steps to maintain their unrestricted air access to Berlin, which would be essential to maintaining the status and security of the city.</p>
<p>b. The Three Embassies at Bonn, in consultation with the tripartite staff in Paris or with other military headquarters as appropriate, should review or complete contingency planning to deal with the following aspects of the Berlin air access question:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) Possible Soviet withdrawal from the Berlin Air Safety Center;</item>
<item>(2) Possible Soviet or East German threats against the safety of flights in the Berlin corridors and control zones;</item>
<item>(3) Measures which might be taken to continue civil air services as long as possible in the event of any change in the present situation;</item>
<item>(4) Possible establishment of a “garrison airlift to transport Allied personnel and material as necessary in the event of an interruption of Allied surface traffic;</item>
<item>(5) The possible substitution of military for civil aircraft to maintain air services to Berlin if civil aircraft cease operations;</item>
<item>(6) Possible direct interference by the Soviets or East Germans with flights in the Berlin corridors or control zone; and</item>
<item>(7) Flights in the Berlin corridors above 10,000 feet. (This issue might be resolved by a simple tripartite agreement to fly at an altitude appropriate to efficient operations of individual aircraft.)</item>
</list>
<p>c. Planning regarding b (4) and b (5) above should be conducted on the understanding that no policy decision has been taken on a “garrison airlift” or on the substitution of military for civil aircraft.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_589" n="589" facs="0614"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">13. Planning Responsibilities and Coordination</p>
<p>a. The Tripartite Ambassadorial Group meeting in Washington is responsible for the over-all coordination of Berlin contingency planning and for the drafting of the statement mentioned in paragraph 3 above.</p>
<p>b. The Three Embassies at Bonn are primarily responsible for the development of recommendations regarding identification of Allied movements (paragraph 7 above), instructions regarding detailed procedures at the checkpoints (paragraph 7 above), and air access planning (paragraph 12 above).</p>
<p>c. The Tripartite Staff in Paris, under the supervision of General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>, is responsible for coordinating the preparatory military measures and the planning described in paragraph 1 above, for studying measures which might be taken to restore freedom of access (paragraph 11 above), and for assisting the Three Embassies at Bonn in carrying out their responsibilities as described in paragraph 13 b above.</p>
<p>d. The Ambassadors of the Three Powers to the United Nations are charged with making recommendations to their Governments regarding the basis and timing of a possible approach to the United Nations (<gloss target="#t_E1">cf</gloss> paragraph 10 a above).</p>
<p>e. The Headquarters of the Three Powers in Berlin will give the Three Embassies at Bonn whatever assistance the latter may require in carrying out their responsibilities as described in paragraph 13 b above.</p>
<p>f. The military authorities in each of the Three Countries are responsible for the planning of measures on a purely national basis, as mentioned in paragraph 1 above, in support of tripartite by planned measures.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT POSITION ON THE BERLIN SITUATION<note n="1" xml:id="d256fn1">Similar reports on the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom, Nos. 7995 and 7996, were prepared on April 8. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note></p>
<p>[Here follows a two-paragraph abstract of the paper.]</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">French Government Position</p>
<p>Throughout the current Berlin crisis the French official position has been firm, but the French have been extremely reluctant to initiate any <pb xml:id="pg_590" n="590" facs="0615"/>negotiating positions which might be taken by the West. This is not to say that the French position is flabby but rather one of “stand-pattism” and not showing one’s cards. The French approach is undoubtedly based on the French interest in preserving as much as possible of the status quo. The French are most reluctant to assist in steps which might lead to a general European settlement adversely altering the relative power status of France vis-à-vis Germany or weakening the security of Western Europe.</p>
<p>Several factors need to be taken into account in explaining the French position. Unlike the German and the British governments the French government is not faced with a vigorous and effective opposition party in Parliament. This, of course, enables the French government to reveal as little of its position at any particular time as it sees fit with no need to parry the critical curiosity of the opposition party. It also means that the position taken need not represent an internal compromisethere is no need to accommodate the position to opposition demands. The result might well be a more stubborn, rigid attitude. A further factor related to this is the dominating personality of General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. For the foreseeable future French policy is likely to be <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> policy no matter what other views may be held at Foreign Office (or other ministerial) working levels. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> may, as in the past, fail to coordinate his policy in any very thorough manner with his Western allies but nonetheless, the end result is likely to be a position in favor of a firm Western stand, including the will to force access. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s policy is less likely than that of any Western power to encompass any disengagement—thinning out of forces—compromise schemes.</p>
<p>Of all the Western allies, France is the least interested in the reunification of West and East Germany. While the other Western allies see the Berlin crisis in terms of achieving general European solutions, the French are happy with the status quo and anxious to avoid the Berlin issue bringing about any weakening of the Western position via disengagement. This undoubtedly helps to account for the rigidity and legalistic character of the French approach. Whereas the French believe the other Western allies consider that the status of Berlin is only negotiable in terms of wider issues—Germany, Central Europe, disarmament—the French prefer to stand on legal rights and to confine the issues to the access question. This may be further reflected in a reluctance to engage in a Summit conference.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">French Estimate of Soviet Objectives</p>
<p>In considering the Soviet objectives in precipitating the Berlin crisis the French Foreign Office at the outset (Nov. 14) believed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wanted to get US forces out of Europe and to prevent an armed, unified Western Europe. In a subsequent analysis, presented by the <pb xml:id="pg_591" n="591" facs="0616"/>French delegation of the Four Power Working Group in Paris on March 10, the French amplified their views. In an effort to perpetuate the present division of Germany the Soviets, in the French view, wish to constrain the West, by explicit recognition of East Germany, to share the responsibility for maintenance of the division of Europe. To achieve this goal, the Soviets are using Berlin and threat of war over Berlin to wring concessions from the West which France in particular is not willing to make. While France has nothing against the division of Europe in its present form, it cannot countenance this division within the framework of disarmament, disengagement, or weakening of the West’s military posture vis-à-vis Soviet military strength.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">French Views on Reunification, Disengagement, and Disarmament</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has in private conversations clearly stated that he is no friend of German reunification (although offering it lip-service in public pronouncements). The reasons are obvious. France does not want the balance of power in Western Europe altered so as to increase the strength of Germany. Nor does it wish to see Western Germany cut loose from its Western military and economic ties. Quite apart from Germany, per se, reunification on terms acceptable to the Soviets would alter the entire military balance in Europe to the almost certain detriment of the West and this is an added reason for French aversion to reunification.</p>
<p>The French are very leery of disengagement and under the firm hand of General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, whose thinking on this problem is premised on military rather than political considerations, there is likely to be great reticence on the part of the French government to agree to any of the disengagement plans currently under discussion (e.g., Rapacki plan, Kennan plan, Gaitskell plan).<note n="2" xml:id="d256fn2">Regarding the Rapacki Plan, see <ref target="#d43fn2">footnote 2, Document 43</ref>. The Kennan plan is presumably a reference to George F. Kennan’s “Disengagement Revisited” in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Affairs</hi>, January 1959, vol. 37, pp. 187–210. The Gaitskell plan probably refers to Hugh Gaitskell’s “Such a Policy Might Pay” in <hi rend="italic">Western World</hi>, Spring 1958, pp. 36–44.</note> Any partial disarmament as a possible concomitant of a Berlin settlement is equally unappealing to the French. Both disengagement and partial disarmament in the French view are likely to lead to a situation in which France is impotent and isolated in the face of a Soviet military threat. General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> has stated categorically (in his March 25 conference)<note n="3" xml:id="d256fn3">For a transcript of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s press conference on March 25, see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Statements</hi>, pp. 41–51.</note> that disengagement has no value for the French and that disarmament would only make sense in terms of a zone extending to the Urals. The French are against disarmament being one of the themes for discussion at a Ministerial or Summit conference with the Russians, since they consider that the West has no agreed position <pb xml:id="pg_592" n="592" facs="0617"/>on disarmament and discussion of this subject would give the Soviets a chance to maneuver Communist China into the discussions.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Jules Moch</persName> has been quoted as saying that from the French point of view any two of the three proposals—reunification, an armed Germany, a neutral Germany—are acceptable but not all three together. It is no doubt with this in mind—even if only subconsciously—that the French are suspicious of reunification and German neutralism. They realize that a reunified and neutral Germany would hardly be left unarmed.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Berlin—Access and Rights</p>
<p>France, like the other Western allies, wants to maintain access to Berlin and the freedom of West Berlin. This has to do with prestige and with the fear that loss of Berlin (or weakening of the Allied position in Berlin) would inevitably result in the gradual breakup of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. In the French view, the Soviets are using Berlin as a gambit to maintain “a state of constant tension tending to weaken German resolve and bring about a desire for neutralism in Germany.” For this reason, regardless of other considerations, Berlin must be held. There must be no drift towards neutralism. The French consider that there are groups in West Germany of all political colorings that are inclined towards neutralism. Failure of the West to take a firm stand in Berlin might well enable these groups to impel West Germany into the neutralistic camp.</p>
<p>It is hardly surprising that the French have a rigid position—a legalistic approach toward the Berlin crisis. They want to maintain the European <hi rend="italic">status quo including that of Berlin</hi>—not at the price of Berlin. They accordingly take a “tough” line, and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> is known to advocate maintaining access by every means possible not excluding force. He tempers this by saying that the West should not be provocative or use force first. The French Foreign Minister, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>, has also stated categorically that the West cannot brook interference with air or land communications with Berlin. He considers it essential that the Western Allies retain the rights which they acquired by the German surrender, including freedom of communication with Berlin.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss></p>
<p>As was to be expected, the French do not want to take the Berlin problem to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> because they fear that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate could tie the hands of the West. They have reluctantly agreed to exploratory discussions with the UK and US Ambassadors at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but obviously intend to remain adamant regarding Western introduction of the issue into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration. The most they would be willing to do is to go to the Security Council under Article 51 of the Charter to inform the Council of Allied measures taken in response to interference with access to Berlin. The French are especially concerned lest the approach to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might occur following a probe by the West but prior to the use of <pb xml:id="pg_593" n="593" facs="0618"/>force by the West with a resultant blockade situation in which the initiative passed from the Western Allies to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Office Views on Berlin</p>
<p>Although there is no French opposition attitude on Berlin there has been some indication that there have been some divergent views within the Foreign Office upon various aspects of handling the crisis. For some weeks following the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech of Nov. 10, the Foreign Office took no official position on the crisis in spite of the fact that the working level in the Foreign Office had consistently advocated a firm policy. The French Foreign Minister indicated at an early stage that he was inclined to feel that continued Western insistence on the “non-existence” of the East German government might be unrealistic. In early December <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> was reported as tentatively proposing negotiations on the whole German question as a means of appearing to give a positive reply to the Soviet Note of Nov. 27. In January <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> stated that although France in its reply to the Nov. 27 note was resolved to reject anything prejudicial to France’s incontestable rights in Berlin, France is prepared, if there is any prospect of arriving at an accord, to discuss the entire German problem including reunification and a peace treaty. The Foreign Office has also had some internal divergence of opinion regarding Soviet motives. One leading official (formerly French Ambassador to Moscow) believes the Russians may be willing to lose East Germany (in the sense of troop withdrawal) to obtain a neutralized, united Germany. The working level of the Foreign Office rejects this view.</p>
<p>Regardless, however, of these apparent divergent opinions, the Foreign Office is certain to follow the line met [<hi rend="italic">set?</hi>] by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, and part of the “rigidity” of the French position may stem from the fact that the Foreign Office must wait to receive its cue before disclosing its position. Because <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> (as is recognized by the Foreign Office) is unpredictable, it is necessary to adopt an extremely circumscribed approach on any theme on which <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s views are not yet known.</p>
<p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph</hi> (<hi rend="italic">20 lines of source text</hi>) <hi rend="italic">not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Berlin and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss></p>
<p>Since the accession of <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> to power, it has been apparent that the French are determined to acquire a role in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> equal to that of the UK and superior to that of Germany. The Berlin crisis may prove to be of great assistance to them in this endeavor because of the close working arrangements, both military and political, among the Three Powers, which the new situation has necessitated. It seems likely that the French will exploit the situation to the full. (French anger towards the US in connection with the Algerian-Moroccan problems may also provide a manipulatable lever in achieving French <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> aims. The French Foreign Minister has very recently stated that US unilateral action in deciding <pb xml:id="pg_594" n="594" facs="0619"/>in principle to supply Morocco with arms would encourage <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> in taking unilateral French actions vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to achieve French goals. The US and other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, faced with the Berlin crisis, will be obliged to discourage any actions which would impair the cohesiveness of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a military force.)</p>
<p>One rather strange suggestion, somewhat unemphatically made by the French on one or two occasions, is that a tenuous relationship for a reunified Germany with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (parallel perhaps to the Russo-Finnish relationship) might somehow be developed as a part of the solution of Berlin. This idea, still very nebulous, seems likely to remain so in view of the improbability of Russian acceptance of any kind of military affiliation of a united Germany with the West.</p>
<p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
<p>There are undoubtedly large segments of the French population, particularly the Communists, which are opposed to the firm policy of the French government on Berlin. However, in view of the existing political situation in France, it seems unlikely that dissident groups have had, or are likely to have, any significant influence upon decisions taken by the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> government. While fear of war as a consequence of the Berlin situation certainly exists in France as in the rest of West Europe, the absence of an effective opposition to exploit this aspect has meant that the government has not had to cater to the public’s fear.</p>
<p>In sum, the French throughout this Berlin crisis, both because of the present political situation within France and the foreign policy aims of the French government, have taken a very firm stand. They will bend every effort to maintaining the status quo in Berlin with freedom of access for the Western Allies. They will balk at any step which may be taken to solve the Berlin crisis if it seems likely to have an adverse effect upon France’s military security. For various reasons—e.g., the existence of a strong government, lack of opposition, France’s geographic position on the continent, concern regarding Germany’s future vis-à-vis France—France has responded to the Berlin crisis in a manner that seems to take into account to a far lesser degree the actual dangers and implications of war than has been the case in the UK or even West Germany. While General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s actions and pronouncements are often unexpected as to timing and content, there seems no reason to think that France’s policy on Berlin will become any less firm. The French are unlikely to cause the US any major difficulties in any aspect other than procedural matters, provided that the US position itself remains firm. France’s own firm policy, as <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> himself has said, is predicated on American power and leadership.</p>

<p>2034. As Four Power Working Group prepares resume preparation of Western negotiating position for Foreign Ministers’ Conference, believe it should be useful sum up various aspects of Soviet position as they are likely to unfold at Geneva. Developments for possible later Summit meeting are largely excluded since too much will depend on interim events.</p>
<p>Kremlin objectives now seem clear. Primary one is to achieve result which will in fact amount to Western acceptance of East European status quo epitomized by some sort of recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. This is, of course, to be accomplished with as much loss as possible of Western prestige and political stature so as to produce maximum disorganization of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, West European unity efforts, defense measures, and West German domestic stability. However, latter gains would at present time serve essentially as icing for Soviet cake, main ingredient of which is to be legitimization of “irrevocable” incorporation of Eastern Europe and Eastern Germany into “socialist camp”. This does not mean that achievement of latter aim by Moscow would herald end of Communistled political warfare against West in Europe (or elsewhere), but it would create new phase and changed conditions of struggle, perhaps related to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s concept of economic competition of two worlds which has prerequisite in his eyes of full consolidation of Eastern empire (Soviet hegemony).</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_596" n="596" facs="0621"/>
<p>Berlin has been lever by which Kremlin has pried loose Western resistance to top-level conferences, and Soviets will undoubtedly contrive to continue to keep it in forefront of attention in coming weeks and months as means of persistent pressure on most vulnerable Allied point. This is not to say that status of and arrangements for Berlin are not themselves important element in overall Kremlin force play to obtain acknowledgment of status quo, but this probably secondary. Indeed, if Moscow should approximately succeed in its major ambition, British may well be correct in assuming that West can get “improved title” providing better-defined access rights and other matters, though probably no longer on basis of occupation rights, and certainly involving agreement to some sort of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> role and to some diminution of those “subversive activities” which most directly impinge on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> internally and which are thus incompatible with new agreement on status quo. On other hand, Embassy would emphasize that if Western position on what adds up to status quo proves unyielding during negotiations (including Summit), Berlin issue is likely to prove insoluble and to develop to point where military considerations and contingency plans for serious trouble will forcefully enter picture.</p>
<p>We are not predicting unavoidable outbreak of war at that point, but serious danger of it and, at minimum, start of active Soviet probing and pressures on Allied and (eventually) West German access to Berlin. This is not because, having started crisis and committed his prestige, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must, for sake of his domestic power position and worldwide “face”, produce victory, although that is factor always deserving consideration. Main reason, rather, is that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is in deadly earnest, on basis of Soviet national interest, as he sees it, in aiming for fatal blow at Western pretensions to challenging existing boundaries of Soviet empire. Since he undoubtedly conceives of himself as being in strategic situation vis-à-vis West which is much improved over that of recent years, and in tactical position at Berlin which is almost ideal, he will not surrender his advantages and return to situation which existed prior to November 10 last year without major effort (if even then or at all) in which all Soviet power and advantages of position will have been brought into play. However, it would be at some point during this major effort that Soviets would presumably have to decide about peace or war, and we continue to believe that there will be great Soviet desire to avoid letting matters get out of hand.</p>
<p>Under this analysis, therefore, crisis over Berlin status involving unilateral Soviet actions would be most unlikely prior to and during Foreign Ministers Conference. If latter were complete failure, tension arising directly from Berlin might begin to increase and troubles develop even before Summit Meeting, although definite agreement to latter would almost surely cause Soviets to hold back until it too had taken <pb xml:id="pg_597" n="597" facs="0622"/>place. This does not mean, of course, that Communist side will not talk great deal about plans for changed Berlin status throughout next months as pressure tactic.</p>
<p>As for Soviet tactics at Foreign Minister Meeting itself, initial positions are, of course, on record and will be brought forth at early stage regarding peace treaty, reunification (confederation), and question of Czech and Polish participation, as well as on “solution” for West Berlin. We would not be surprised if Western negotiators, after hard bargaining, gradually encounter series of Soviet “fall-back” positions on individual articles of peace treaty, on specifics of Berlin solution, and on temporary or provisional exclusion of Czechs and Poles from meeting. Essential sticking point, however, would always be over agreement with any Western proposals which would obviate necessity for West to give substantial de facto recognition to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. While we would not anticipate much Soviet initiative on European security aspects of problem, Moscow will probably be ready discuss some items, including versions of Rapacki Plan arms freezes and other limitations, providing that these proposals operate explicitly towards confirming general status quo and would not be disadvantageous to Soviet military position.</p>
<p>In terms of attaining basic Soviet objectives, directly suitable vehicle for Moscow is Soviet form of East-West German confederation which would, in effect, sanctify existing split of Germany and perpetuate two states into indefinite future. Soviets will probably play this game by ear depending on their assessments of West German political scene. Their immediate reaction to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> decision to seek presidency<note n="1" xml:id="d257fn1">On April 7 <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had announced his decision to seek the Presidency of the Federal Republic.</note> is that incalculable new elements of fluidity have entered picture which cannot but encourage their hopes for greater ascendancy of those West German forces willing to dicker with Moscow and Pankow. (Recent Soviet publication of <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> reunification scheme<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2">See <ref target="#d254fn3">footnote 3, Document 254</ref>.</note> was undoubtedly meant to bolster those same forces.) Soviet diplomats and intelligence officers have no doubt gotten hold of information indicating major cleavages within Bonn Foreign Office and <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> on proper policy response to Soviet challenge, and may even have heard of recent <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> vacillation.</p>
<p>Soviet negotiators can thus be expected to make major probe of exploitability of political currents in West Germany who may be willing to abandon long-standing Western policy on reunification. They likely to assume that if official West German position becomes soft, France and especially UK will not overly object, and US will be unable to do more than slow down trend. Presence at Geneva of representatives of two German states will provide opportunity for Soviets and East Germans to <pb xml:id="pg_598" n="598" facs="0623"/>indulge in numerous maneuvers to wage varied political and psychological warfare to get delegates of both Germanies together by themselves as big first step towards political dealing.</p>
<p>Peace treaty discussion is not quite as salable a topic as confederation for Soviet moves towards consolidating status quo, but it has obvious possibilities nevertheless. Attractiveness to some Germans of simple treaty with two German states might increase if Soviets dropped what amount to punitive provisions and to clauses loaded to favor Communist cause, especially if Soviets seem to introduce new articles with implied concessions. Such Moscow shifts are therefore conceivable. Threat of separate Soviet treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will be kept in readiness for appropriate use, if possible, to promote primary objective.</p>
<p>There is some chance that Soviets will attempt to sweeten general atmosphere immediately prior to Foreign Ministers Conference by making enough concessions at Geneva Atom Test Talks to produce agreement there. This would strengthen hand of Westerners arguing for flexibility and asserting that USSR genuinely desires negotiation and compromise. More specifically, it might well give impetus to advocates of European security arrangements who desire various arms limitation and inspection schemes even when separated from progress on European political settlements. Although we are inclined to think that any major new Soviet proposals in this field (and global disarmament) are likely to be held back for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself to introduce at summit, Moscow probably has greater area for relatively safe concessions in this field than in any other, and signs of this may show up with Foreign Ministers. Difficulty for Kremlin is that it is possible for Western statesmen to design security plans which might attract many Westerners and even meet some of Soviet considerations without necessarily involving de facto recognition of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and status quo. This would not fulfill primary Kremlin aim which is, after all, not enhanced military security for USSR but protection of their basic political situation. Considerations of this nature may explain signs of relative Moscow disinterest in, security questions, which, indeed, are not even on Soviet agenda for Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>As suggested above, Berlin itself may not initially be major focus of negotiations (once Soviets have tabled their plan) until USSR determines trend of conference on other topics. However, if it becomes apparent that fundamental Western position on German problem is not changing from that of recent years, Moscow is likely to step up conference emphasis on Berlin itself in effort to use settlement of its status as last resort means for breaking Allied position and attaining own goals.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_599" n="599" facs="0624"/>
<p>It is clear that Soviet aims require Moscow to be appealing incessantly to Western (especially West German and British) opinion during negotiations probably coupled with threats in attempt to force changes in Western stand. As in other recent talks with USSR, therefore, it is illusory to expect any maintenance of secrecy except on certain informal occasions.</p>

American firmness credited with success in achieving abandonment by Soviets of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s November ultimatum. Abatement tension partly mere temporary relief that May 27 now no longer represents in Berlin deadline date beyond which no one could make plans or have hopes with any sense of reality. Berliners by no means feel that their city has been saved, but their hope that it will be is now grounded on a feeling that they have strong friends and real support, not merely on their own courage. They will continue to follow most closely all developments connected with the formulation of Western policy, especially with the crucial question whether US prepared resort to force if necessary.</p>
<p>Congressional interest manifested by visits 18 Representatives and 3 Senators during recent weeks and firm bipartisan assurances of backing for President’s stand re Berlin as well as numerous statements by SecDefense and US military leaders (<persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName>, Taylor) have had uplifting effect.</p>

<p>On other hand there is in Berlin considerable apprehension re confusion surrounding international debate on Berlin and all German problems. Berliners’ gratification over apparent unanimous determination that they shall be saved is tempered by concern generated from dispute as to methods by which they may be saved and worry as to whether hopes of German unity might be sacrificed for Berlin. There is also continuing and grave concern about British position and fear that British Govt may for domestic reasons drag US into some sort arrangement in which valuable ground may be bartered away for the sake of agreement to ease international tensions which may prove illusory in long run.</p>
<p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> is emphatic in his belief that <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s hope obtain some kind agreement introducing new element into status Berlin or altering that status, even if only implicitly, in manner which might permit it in some unforeseeable way to be eroded by <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s.

Despite weakness, present legal basis constitutes clearer claim right maintain occupation forces Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> believes, than any compromised situation which would give “batteries of Communist lawyers” opportunity over period years nibble away at legal position occupying powers. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName>, even more than <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>, is fearful of results if East-West conference separates German problem from Berlin problem and deals with latter in isolation. Both mayors, most political leaders, and newspapers such as influential <hi rend="italic">Tagesspiegel</hi> believe that failure reach East-West understanding re Berlin and subsequent showdown would be preferable to any change which could possibly weaken legal basis Western presence.

Interior Senator Lipschitz said “Commies would need only 24 hours seize West Berlin by force, and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> obviously incapable making immediate decision and acting swiftly enough to resist such a seizure.” He added, “interminable deliberations after fact would not restore city’s freedom.”</p>

<p>[Here follows a list of participants.]</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName> explained that he had suggested this meeting primarily to consider the two studies on military and nonmilitary actions which might be taken to maintain allied access to Berlin after such access has been unacceptably interfered with. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> suggested that if agreement could be reached on these studies at this meeting, the principals responsible for the studies plus other officials as determined by the President, might go to Augusta on Thursday of next week (the usual <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting time) to present these reports to the President.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had found the military paper on the Four Alternative Uses of Force generally O.K., but were very opposed to including the Summary and Conclusions. The Chiefs felt that only the basic study should be submitted to the President. The Chiefs had some comments on the study on non-military measures, but had found it generally O.K.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> said that Defense found the papers generally O.K., subject to a few changes which could be worked out without taking them up at this meeting.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> added that the Joint Chiefs recommend that the military paper be sent to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>, and that his comments be awaited before submitting it to the President.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> showed some charts which had been prepared by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> based on the Summary and Conclusions of each of the studies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> also said that the Joint Chiefs had some maps to illustrate the studies. He suggested that these might provide a means of presentation of the reports to the President, subject to the decisions as to the content of the reports.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he would go along with the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He felt it would be premature to present these studies to the President next Thursday. He thought we should have the reaction of General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s Paris Planning Group first. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that this whole problem was in flux and, unless there were to be preliminary presentation to the President, more time would be required. He pointed out that the International Working Group will reconvene in London next Monday (April 13, 1959), and we should know more as a result of those meetings.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_602" n="602" facs="0627"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that was a respectable viewpoint, but his experience indicated that nothing was ever really ready, and meanwhile we go along making decisions by the force of events. He asked what national security policy, decisions the President has to make. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> understood that Defense and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> were deeply concerned at the Four-Power Working Group report. In summary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> wondered whether the President’s reactions and comments on these two studies would not be helpful now.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> pointed out regarding the military study that the paper does not include <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s planning for a possible probe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> pointed out that if the paper was sent to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> it would probably go into the Three-Power Planning Group.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> questioned whether this group would want to put the military study into the Three-Power Planning Group without the President’s knowing what has been put in there. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> said he thought the President should have the study and read it before it is put into the Four-Power Group. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> suggested then that a decision be made whether to have the Thursday meeting with the President.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the Joint Chiefs wanted the military paper sent to the Three-Power Group in order to smoke out just what our allies are willing to do. He said that the reports to date were not encouraging. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> agreed that we want to find out whether our allies are prepared to go along with us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said the question was whether responsible people think these studies are ready for the President. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> agreed that there were two or three things that still needed to be straightened out.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> questioned whether there should be one paper or the entire problem submitted to the President. The State Department has visualized giving the President a comprehensive briefing on the entire problem of Berlin and Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that he had proposed that only the two studies be submitted to the President at this time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> also thought that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> should see the military study. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> asked whether the military or the non-military studies should now be submitted to the President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> thought that they should be submitted only after General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s comments have been received. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said he wanted General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s comments but he also wanted the views of our allies as soon as possible. He said that until we submit our views the British have indicated that they will not plan for these contingencies.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that May 11 is going to be a very important date. If Defense is to be prepared to take the steps contemplated in these studies, they need to know.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_603" n="603" facs="0628"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> felt that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] should have a reasonable time of three or four days, and then be asked to reflect his views before the studies go to the President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> suggested that the studies could be sent to London tomorrow (April 12, 1959) for delivery to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> by people who are going over with the working group. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> agreed that we should have General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s comments before submitting the studies to the President. He also believed that they should be submitted to the President before they are given to a Three-Power group. However, we must as soon as possible get these studies into a Three-Power group.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> questioned whether after General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s comments were received, how the studies should be presented to the President. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought that next Thursday would be a nice date to plan on and then let the President decide what further he wanted to do. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> suggested that the studies be given to the President to read and then he can decide what he wants to do about a meeting. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought that the President should be asked to read the studies looking toward Three-Power action. In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s question as to whether the non-military paper would also be submitted, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that State would like the President to read that as well. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> suggested that the non-military paper be treated the same as the military. It was generally agreed that these two studies should be treated the same, and that an overall memorandum of transmittal to the President should be agreed upon.</p>
<p>In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s question, General Cabell suggested that the intelligence splits in the military paper not be hidden. General Cabell felt that the users of that document should see those split views. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said he thought that was right. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> agreed that the intelligence splits should not be hidden but questioned whether the principals would like to express their views on these splits. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> thought the President may not wish the principals to resolve these splits. He thought that they should be presented as balanced judgments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that these are very fundamental splits, and that the President may have to decide. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> understood that the principals do not want to try to resolve them.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then questioned whether the principals should address themselves to the timing of the various measures in the study. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> thought that making plans for these measures was essential but he personally did not think that any of them would ever happen. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> did not think that the specific actions that should be taken at any given time can be accurately predicted in advance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> thought that we must make our plans for the worst contingencies in any case.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_604" n="604" facs="0629"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then summed up his understanding that the remaining disagreements on the two studies would be ironed out—that the nonmilitary paper would go along with the military, plus an agreed memorandum of transmittal—and that we would await General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s comments before sending the studies to the President.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> asked whether the summary and conclusions were going to be sent to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>. Admiral Triebel expressed his concern because the study itself does not make clear that a “garrison airlift” has already been agreed upon.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> asked whether there should be any conclusions. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> suggested that the military paper begin with the body of the study on page 10, and that there be no conclusions. This was agreed. It was also agreed that the summary on the non-military paper was O.K.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> suggested that both General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> and the planning group in Bonn get the non-military paper. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> suggested that if either of them had any comments they might also go to the President with the paper.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then asked what decisions were needed regarding the so-called “phased plan” which was going back to the Four-Power Working Group. He asked whether there were any differences between State and Defense on this plan. Also he wondered if there were any policy decisions on the high altitude flight to Berlin.</p>
<p>On the latter question, General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the Joint Chiefs were waiting for the U.S. reply to go back to Moscow. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> had cleared that an additional high altitude flight might be made, but not until the U.S. note had been delivered in Moscow. Then, there was to be a limit of one flight. General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> had been told to be prepared for this flight but to await further word.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that Admiral Dudley now had received some new comments from the Joint Chiefs on the “phased plan”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> said that there are differences between State and Defense on which they would be getting together with State after this meeting.</p>
<p>At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s request, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that the May 11 meeting would deal with Germany with all its aspects and Berlin. He did not worry as much as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> over the “phased plan” or possible differences. At the May 11 meeting we will present four positions:</p>
<list>
<item>1. On Berlin, which will be simple if we mean what we say about not being kicked out.</item>
<item>2. On reunification of Germany.</item>
<item>3. On European security arrangements.</item>
<item>4. On a German peace treaty.</item>
</list>
<p>On Berlin, we are working from a clear national policy, only the modalities have to be worked out. On reunification, we are working from <pb xml:id="pg_605" n="605" facs="0630"/>existing policy based on free elections. On the peace treaty, there is a clear policy going back to 1955. European security is the only area where there is discussion between State, Defense and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> as to whether extensions of past policy should be worked in, in order to obtain the support of public opinion for our position. This area also deeply involves the attitude of our allies. The question is how much of our 1957 disarmament proposals we will include in the plan. We must obviously talk this question out with our allies.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said there is also the question of stationing certain missiles in Germany. Defense and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> do not wish to waive that right, whereas the British, French and West Germans would waive it. He pointed out that, after all, we cannot make the West Germans refuse to waive that right.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said there was also the question of inserting surprise attack formulas in the package. Defense and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> are reviewing our past positions on this subject during the next two weeks. This question must also be determined in part by discussions with our allies.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> summed up that some of these questions may be ones on which State and Defense will have to get a command decision. However, he thought that they were not yet matured sufficiently for presentation to the President. As far as the other aspects of the negotiations are concerned, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he does not feel unprepared as regards to policy, and the rest of the problem involves tactics. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out that the Acting Secretary of State would certainly want to get the President’s approval to positions before going to the negotiations.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> agreed generally with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>. He said that what points of difference there were were related to the European security arrangements. He felt that the U.S. position should not be based on the feelings of our allies, but rather we should determine what position we wish to take with our allies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> agreed that the problem was that the U.S. position should not be determined by our allies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he had intended to suggest that our position be influenced by, but not determined by, our allies.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that he was only concerned that, if basic decisions involving national security were required, that they be secured in time.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that the State Department was determined to get a decision on their European security proposals. He hoped that they could be reconciled with Defense, but that otherwise they would certainly go to the President in ample time for his decision. In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that we must get the President’s decision before the Four-Power Working Group meetings are finished.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_606" n="606" facs="0631"/>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> said they had discussed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> the problems of disarmament and surprise attack. As a result, both State and Defense have instituted a broad attack on both problems. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> felt that these problems were much the most serious. He referred to the 1957 policy on disarmament and said that it was very dangerous to make piecemeal changes in that document. He urged that we block out the disarmament issues in a way which would identify any revisions in the August 1957 policy. He felt sure that there must be time for the President to consider this issue, or otherwise we might make a dangerous slip. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> said that he did not disagree with the State Department on the need for negotiating tactics, but he felt that we should be very clear on our policy before playing it in a conference.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that he assumed from this discussion that a decision would be sought from the President in a broad and timely way.</p>

A shorter discussion of the party factors involved was transmitted in telegram 2251 from Bonn, April 9. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762A.13/4–959)</note> and for timing his action, and their relative importance can probably never be determined.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s trip Moscow gave <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> deep concern from start. To him fact of trip itself, quite apart from any results it might have, constituted dangerous and totally unnecessary step, which could only be interpreted by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as evidence significant disunity in Western camp. The substantive by-products of trip can only have confirmed <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s fears and justified his apprehensions. That <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should have agreed officially explore further some form alteration of existing military and security arrangements Central Europe, undoubtedly added to his resentment and gloom.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_607" n="607" facs="0632"/>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ visit to Bonn early February<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">See <ref target="#d165">Documents 165</ref>–<ref target="#d169">169</ref>.</note> was closely followed by announcement his illness. It not difficult imagine how deeply Chancellor must have been affected by possibility his relationship with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> which was epitome close collaboration and common policy with US, might now be coming to end. It would, in our view, be wrong underestimate effect upon Chancellor’s outlook on future, of coincidence of Secretary’s illness with what to him seemed to be venomous fruits of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s trip Moscow and, in fact, of his overall posture thereafter.</p>
<p>Whether, and if so, to what extent Chancellor has formed impression of trend toward general abandonment basic positions held by West, and by him and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in particular, we will probably never know. By “basic position” the Chancellor naturally means his own views on any subject, at heart of which lies his unshakeable conviction nothing must be allowed threaten presence US forces Germany. We know he has long felt there is practically nothing argue about as to what constitutes right and proper attitude of West toward the Soviet Union, and that all discussions such concepts as “flexibility” are to him not merely useless but pernicious. It not unreasonable suppose that in light his own convictions and suspicious nature, the Chancellor may have become increasingly fearful that West on way down slippery slope dangerous concessions under pressure from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In view of Chancellor’s political record and public comportment would doubtless be mistake attribute excessive weight to effect personal attacks upon him as one remaining obstacle to possibility reasonable accommodation Soviet Union. However he is in certain respects curiously and intensely emotional human being. While he has always publicly welcomed and prided himself upon Soviet attacks against him when Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was similar target, would be rash suppose his temperamental robustness has not been somewhat impaired of late by addition the British press onslaught of last few weeks at time when he no longer so sure US standing rock-like beside him. We feel that prominence he gave in his public address on April 8<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">A copy of this address is in Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D 327.</note> to Anglo-German relations indicative that he deeply troubled by this matter.</p>
<p>We do not know how Chancellor assessed implications recent discussions Washington, to what extent <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName>’s report to him may have increased his doubts, and weighed on his mind at time when he was considering decision which he finally took that same day. However we feel one cannot reasonably exclude possibility that combination, or the mere culmination, of factors broadly discussed above may have <pb xml:id="pg_608" n="608" facs="0633"/>played role precipitating his decision, at least at time and in form in which it was taken.</p>
<p>By virtue of very nature <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s reasoning as analyzed above, Chancellor would not wish to reveal it to public, and line given out by his closest advisers and picked up by all <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> naturally puts total emphasis on domestic political aspects his action. Furthermore, internal problems succession and continuity have undoubtedly been increasingly weighing upon <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, and certainly uppermost in thoughts his closest advisers and friends. How decision, and events expected flow from it, are viewed politically in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> are discussed below without further reference to private worries of Chancellor which stemmed mostly from external sources.</p>
<p>It certainly not <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s intention leave helm during period conferences ahead and we have found no <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> politicians who sense any defeatism or resignation in Chancellor or in his party as result his action. Rather we and other observers find throughout <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> elation that good solution worrisome problem transition with which grim fact of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s age faces party, has now been found. <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> believes Chancellor determined and politically able maintain his policies through critical months ahead, and has now taken steps which he hopes will assure their continuance for years and will promote future election prospects party and his chosen successor as Chancellor.</p>
<p>Problems leadership transition and policy continuity after <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> have long troubled <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> leaders and have, to our knowledge, been active in Chancellor’s mind at least for past three or four months as approaching end <persName corresp="#p_HT1">Heuss</persName>’ term<note n="4" xml:id="d260fn4">President <persName corresp="#p_HT1">Heuss</persName>’ term was due to expire in September 1959.</note> presents opportunity do something about them. Chancellor’s tentative move January make Krone President was taken with these problems in mind, and in subsequent search for another candidate succession to Chancellorship has been first consideration. Chancellor’s closest party advisers have become convinced would be vastly preferable for <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> use his prestige and authority to direct changeover than have it settled in free-for-all under uncertain future circumstances. <persName corresp="#p_GH1">Globke</persName> and Krone have pressed these considerations on Chancellor, building up potential powers presidency and pointing out to him that despite his extraordinary vigor, he will increasingly have to save energies for great issues only, and forcing him consider that even he could not be sure leading 1961 campaign, as he wished to do, at 85. In this connection there are reports <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s family, physician, and close personal friends such as Pferdmenges have for some time been urging him consider giving up Chancellorship in order spare himself. With presidential elections set for July 1, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had <pb xml:id="pg_609" n="609" facs="0634"/>to act before mid-June at latest, and meeting party committee to seek presidential candidate had been called for April 7.</p>
<p>Furthermore, present state international affairs certainly tends convince <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> his foreign policy can only be continued by one wholly dedicated to it. Although Economics Minister <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>’s claims to succession have been steadily growing stronger, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s preference is for Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName>. Present offers best chance make <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName>, who for years has been active supporter European integration, Chancellor and to have time build up his popularity and prestige to point where he can lead and win 1961 elections in order to stay in. <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName>’s name, highly respected in political circles but little known popularly, now frequently mentioned in press and parties; many <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> deputies have gone out their way to praise him to us as next Chancellor.</p>
<p>As regards implications and consequences of change, situation can perhaps be best summed up in phrase: “We are not in end but in beginning of end of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> era”. Nature of German policy for next two years—(until 1961 elections) will to large extent depend on who succeeds <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> as Chancellor next September. This question already the big issue in Bonn political circles especially among <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> deputies, and there is general agreement that either <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> will be next Chancellor. To some extent <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is gambling. Deputies will be aware that their future election will not depend on <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and his power over faction will be correspondingly lessened. Although as President <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> may make first proposal for new Chancellor it not certain he can then still command faction support.</p>
<p>When several weeks ago Chancellor tried shelve <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> by pushing him into presidency, he was publicly overridden by <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> Bundestag faction and an unprecedented expression popular desire to keep <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> in active politics. This rebuff was taken bitterly by Chancellor and is another element of discouragement which may have influenced his present decision. More importantly, incident is generally evaluated as a mandate for <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and his economic policies from general public and <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> Bundestag faction and is evidence that if <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName> wants chancellorship he may be able marshal overwhelming support against possible efforts by <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> to name another. It seems doubtful to us that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> would risk such a showdown and we expect he will, therefore, have to reckon with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> in question of forming next government.</p>
<p>Under either <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, strength of <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> dissidents (such as <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName> and Gradl, with their emphasis on greater tactical flexibility in seeking reunification) in Bundestag faction will probably increase to certain extent once Chancellor’s personal control of <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> removed when he assumes presidency. If <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName> becomes Chancellor, we may expect continuation basic elements Chancellor’s policies; and in period before <pb xml:id="pg_610" n="610" facs="0635"/>next election unlikely that <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> dissidents would bring about any significant alterations foreign policy. If <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> becomes Chancellor there might be some change—most notably there would probably be less emphasis on European integration, Common Market and special alignment with France than under <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>’s good friend <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName> may have more influence foreign affairs. Under either <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>’s close relations with and reliance on US and its firm support of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should remain unchanged. It worth emphasizing that <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> headed not only by <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> but by great number strong men who broadly share his views and that an important element of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s power has been popularity his policies. There accordingly little reason expect any upheaval <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>’s policies. Over longer run those who advocate greater flexibility may gain influence but they will have to fight for it.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> may also have been oversold on powers presidency. Legally they very limited indeed and real power rests in chancellorship. If <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s man in that job then potential considerable but with an opponent as Chancellor, President is hamstrung. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> may be shocked to see how fast his star falls once real power out of his hand and others run cabinet, Bundestag faction and party. However, would be misleading underestimate <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s cleverness, and by appeals to public, personal influence and use of representative nature of office to deal with foreign powers he might make it very influential position. It will certainly be different from situation under <persName corresp="#p_HT1">Heuss</persName>.</p>
<p>At present stage feel following conclusions justified:</p>
<p>1. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> seems sure be elected President July. His enemies are so delighted see him leave office Chancellor and probably fearful that he might remain Chancellor if defeated as President, that many may vote for him as enthusiastically as his friends: (Carlo Schmid as <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> opponent has already quipped that he will vote for <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>.)</p>
<p>2. Regardless either Chancellor’s or party’s motives prior event, decision will probably make transition from <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> to <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> successor smoother than confused results his sudden death while in office Chancellor would have permitted.</p>
<p>3. We have assumed on basis evidence presently available that Chancellor prefers <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName> as his successor. We know <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> has many supporters for job including very active <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName> busily promoting his own ambitions by pushing <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. If <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> does not wish step aside to make things easy for Chancellor and <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName>, we can expect at least severe struggle within <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> in coming months which would not bode well for “smooth transition” from Chancellor to successor.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_611" n="611" facs="0636"/>
<p>4. From now until September, however, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> will be Chancellor and will probably have only slightly diminished control over foreign policy, specifically such matters as instructing working group representatives, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>, and <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> observer at Foreign Ministers and possibly summit meetings, and we see in present circumstances no reason for him to be less rigid than previously.</p>
<p>5. It seems most unrealistic for US assume that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, after becoming President and surrendering leadership party (required by constitution) will have anywhere near power and influence which he has today or even that amount which his supporters now claim he will have.</p>
<p>6. Although there every indication that any responsible <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> successor will have same general outlook on relations to, and on position in, Western world of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>, we cannot count on there being no change. In effect, diverse groups within rather ill-disciplined German Foreign Office and vari-colored ideas which spring from them are but reflection in microcosm of nervous stirrings of politically and foreign affair-conscious non-socialist groups throughout country. Under <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> until very recently these people and such ideas which might in any way, in his opinion, conflict with or even distantly threaten his fundamental view of basis of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>’s security and rock-like policy for which he personally has always stood, have been ruthlessly squashed. No possible successor to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> will wield such authority in such a way. What this may mean for our relations with <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> under new Chancellor is that although we will continue to have staunch ally, we shall probably have less predictable one.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 033.5141/4–1059)</note> Discussions April 13 between <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> concerned almost exclusively with problems Berlin, Germany and forthcoming Foreign Ministers meeting with Soviets. Foreign Office quite pleased with talks and considers large measure of agreement exists between British and French approach these problems.</p>
<p>With respect Berlin <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> in agreement that there should be no tampering with existing legal rights but new agreements on access might be negotiated and superimposed on existing legal rights. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> thought that in such new agreement provision should be made for guaranteeing right of access for civilian population. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> also expressed view that in course negotiations with Soviets they might be given some satisfaction with respect 1) limiting propaganda originating in Berlin 2) ending obvious political links between Berlin and West Germany and 3) with respect to refugees (according Foreign Office <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> did not elaborate on latter point). In exchange Russians should be required recognize their responsibility for guaranteeing exercise Western rights in Berlin even if they were to conclude separate peace treaty with <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>British raised question of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in approving or giving sanction to East-West agreement on Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName>’s reaction was completely negative with respect to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> involvement in any way in Berlin settlement. He pointed out Soviets enjoy veto in Security Council and there might be adverse majority with respect Western position in General Assembly. He said that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was of no use to West in matter and in fact Soviets might subsequently attempt make use of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to get out of agreement if one were concluded.</p>
<p>On subject free elections <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that Western initial position must be more realistic than in 1955. It would not be realistic to put forward free elections as first step. He was not pessimistic about possibility obtaining German acceptance this point of view despite position taken by <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> during recent Washington meetings. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> asserted with emphasis that other Western powers could not afford <pb xml:id="pg_613" n="613" facs="0638"/>antagonize Germans even though it was necessary to get modus vivendi with Russians. There could be no de jure recognition of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> but increased contacts between Federal Republic and <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> were possible. According Foreign Office <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> repeatedly emphasized importance carrying Germans with us.</p>
<p>There was some general discussion <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> idea of zone of force and arms limitations with emphasis in British presentation, according Foreign Office, on zone of inspection. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> was not opposed to special security zone in Europe provided there was no question of neutralization of Germany and provided present European “political organization” was not prejudiced thereby, i.e. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and presence American forces in Germany. He also expressed view such zone should embrace portion Russian territory. Without offering answer, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> posed question of what proposals West should make in Foreign Ministers’ meeting after initial position based essentially on 1955 proposals had been tabled and rejected by Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> thought that Russians would not play all their cards at Foreign Ministers’ meeting but would reserve fall-back proposals for summit. He thought West should do likewise. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that it was important to be clear in our own minds whether we wanted to go to the summit or not so that our tactics at the Foreign Ministers’ meeting could be adjusted accordingly.

Following are some general impressions after second day of Working Group session.<note n="1" xml:id="d262fn1"><persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> was in London as the head of the U.S. Delegation to the Four-Power Working Group, which began work on April 13 (see <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>).</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_614" n="614" facs="0639"/>
<p>1. Both Germans and French continue to take extremely cautious position on reunification proposals, and there appears to be little prospect in Working Group of restoring major elements of original US proposals or even German proposals made at Paris meetings.<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> It should, however, be possible to preserve framework of phased plan and to retain a few novelties in its content such as creation of mixed committee prior to holding of free elections. New and peculiar German proposal to use residual authority of occupying powers to implement decisions of mixed committee obviously needs to be reconsidered (see <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 5334).<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">Telegram 5334, April 14, transmitted a summary of the discussion at the second session of the Working Group, which focused on a German plan for reunification of Germany.

<p>2. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] Having read spate of newspaper speculation about possible confederation proposals, they apparently insist on labeling any contact between East and West Germans beyond those in their own proposals as equivalent to confederation, even though such contacts or institutionalizations thereof involve no executive or other governmental powers. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p>3. British are playing unusually reticent role. They have put forward no security proposals and their Berlin paper<note n="4" xml:id="d262fn4">A copy of this paper, given to the Department of State on April 10, was transmitted to Bonn in airgram G–453, April 10. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/4–1059)</note> reflected none of willingness to accept basic changes which they allegedly are resigned to. If we may hazard guess, they will not reveal themselves further in present Working Group sessions but will concur without too much difficulty in agreed recommendations reached by Working Group. There have been no hints of any proposals for European security measures not linked to phased plan.</p>
<p>4. French generally can be counted on to react almost pathologically to suggestions that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might play any significant role. They have, however, indicated at least willingness to consider possibility of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> function re Berlin as envisaged British paper.

<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> expressed France’s regret at learning of the Secretary’s resignation<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2"><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> tendered his resignation as Secretary of State on April 15.</note> and extended his sympathy to the Secretary. He then asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> to convey the sense of the latest instructions from Paris.</p>
<p>The Ambassador said that <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had sent a cable from London asking him to take up immediately with the State Department the French belief that European security and reunification should be combined in any presentation. The French have come up with a counter-proposal to the draft prepared by the London experts and hope that it can receive prompt consideration by the US. The French believe their proposal can receive the support of all concerned, including the Germans. (M. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> saw Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> on this subject later in the day.)<note n="3" xml:id="d263fn3">A memorandum of this conversation is in Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/4–1559.</note></p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> said that there are dangers in initiating European security plan consideration without this link. This could lead directly into the Rapacki plan. Security and reunification need to go hand-in-hand with parallel steps to be taken. This is what the French propose.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he too believed that a jump into thinning-out proposals could create dangers.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> said that the Paris Accords<note n="4" xml:id="d263fn4">For texts of the Nine- and Four-Power agreements signed at Paris, October 23, 1954, see <ref target="frus1952-54v05p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. V, Part 2</ref>, pp. 1435 ff.</note> provide a basis. Under these the Germans freely accepted certain limitations. Initially, the Soviets <pb xml:id="pg_616" n="616" facs="0641"/>denounced these accords. They might by now have a different conception of them and might be willing to come up with some sort of “revised Locarno”.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that the Soviets seem to be seeking to freeze the status quo, with, perhaps, an exception for Berlin.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> said he believes they do fear competition from Berlin. He did not think, however, that the Soviets were searching for a permanent freeze of the status quo in Germany but rather sought the ability to play the German problem over a long period of time. It might be a neutralized, reunified Germany which could be a later goal. He asked if we thought the present freeze is due to Asian pressures.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that this is certainly a reason. There are pressures within the Communist hierarchy and from Mao and Chou. The Soviets seek about for ways to ease pressures on themselves or put them on us. They tried in the Middle East and were rather checked by a lack of success with Nasser.</p>
<p>In response to M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName>’s question as to whether we believe the Soviets find Communist China a dangerous ally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he did not think it went that far. The Soviets are perhaps suspicious of the power and attitudes of the <gloss target="#t_ChiComs1">ChiComs</gloss>. There is some uneasiness between the two. There is for us the question as to how we can estimate these differences.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> said that he did not want to force conclusions. He saw difficulties growing; he noted the differences on agricultural theory. In the past, he continued, the <gloss target="#t_ChiComs1">ChiComs</gloss> have been the pragmatic ones; the Soviets, the theoreticians so far as foreign affairs are concerned. They now seem to be reversing roles and it is increasingly clear the <gloss target="#t_ChiComs1">ChiComs</gloss> are entering the international sphere as, for example, in Africa. When he sees Russians, he said, he finds that they tend to talk about Europe and regard themselves as Europeans. He has no illusions that there is a divorce between the Soviets and the Chinese, but we cannot ignore the evidence.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that the Soviets who come here seem genuinely interested in the betterment of conditions inside Russia.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> said the Soviets realize that they are without all the advantages of the US yet believe they can play a role in economic development. He had been encouraged to note that the Soviets were permitting a US exhibition at their Moscow fair.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said this seemed to illustrate a measure of Soviet self-assurance.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said there is a suppleness in Soviet policy. They are not issuing ultimatums. Their reactions to the high altitude flights showed self-assurance.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_617" n="617" facs="0642"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> mentioned the recent C–97 flight<note n="5" xml:id="d263fn5">Documentation on the C–97 flight on April 3 is in Department of State, Central File 762B.5411.</note> and said we were undertaking another with a C–130 at a high altitude but had had no reports yet other than to say that there had been no incident.<note n="6" xml:id="d263fn6">The second C–130 flight was made during the morning of April 15.</note></p>
<p>When M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> said the West must remain firm, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> added that we must also not be afraid. Too many statements about apprehensions, as are being made in the UK, sap our position. We don’t want and don’t expect war and don’t believe the Soviets do either. Firmness is the only way.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> agreed with this. He then reverted to Germany. He said we have made two tactical errors. We should not have agreed so fast that the two Germanies could attend the conferences. We should have waited and let this concession be extracted from us. Second, we talked too soon and too much about disengagement. We should have been more reserved.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked if this had been discussed in London between <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>.<note n="7" xml:id="d263fn7">See <ref target="#d261">Document 261</ref>.</note></p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> said that he did not have many details on these talks. There did not seem to have been any agreement on European security. It was agreed the West had to remain firm on its access rights to Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he understood that there had been discussion of maintaining the base of our rights but superimposing other ideas on top of that.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> agreed and added that we cannot negotiate a new juridical status for Berlin. One must be firm when negotiating with the devil.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked if the French expected any accomplishment from the Foreign Ministers’ conference.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> said that he foresaw a long series of conferences and meetings. We won’t know the Soviet position until the last moment as the Soviets are still testing whether we will remain firm.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said they might vary their behavior, alternating suppleness with hardness.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> agreed and said the Soviets really want a Summit Conference. They may make gestures to make it possible.</p>
<p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s question as to why the Soviets want a conference, M. Jones said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> seems to need a Summit for internal party reasons.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_618" n="618" facs="0643"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> inquired whether the French had any thoughts on softening the presence of the three powers in Berlin, aimed at calming Soviet apprehensions on espionage, propaganda or refugees.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> said this is a point to consider but we should hold it in reserve. We could ask them if they have such fears and then say we’ll consider what we might do.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> said we could also stimulate contacts between the two Germanies.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> interjected “but without recognition”. He then went on to say that he believed <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had taken over the Presidency for internal reasons but doubted if he could go all the way and impose <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName>. The German position seems to have two cardinal points: hold in Berlin and no recognition. After these, it seems fairly open.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> mentioned the Pan-German committee to prepare the electoral law, which the Germans had proposed.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that this should probably be presented as something flexible rather than iron-clad so that it can contribute the idea that the two Germanies can live together.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then inquired about Italian participation. He said that <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> are pushing hard.<note n="8" xml:id="d263fn8">On April 14 Ambassador Zellerbach reported that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> spent the better part of a half hour conversation on the question of Italian participation in the forthcoming talks on Germany. (Telegram 3060 from Rome; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/4–1459)</note> He asked if the Italians had been in touch with the French recently.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRH1">McBride</persName> then said the Italians yesterday had proposed some new wording, including “support” and “from the outset”, which seemed difficult. They had said they had not yet tried the idea on London and Paris. We had suggested they do so. They also want now to take part in the 29th conference.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> said that the latter is new. He will see if the French have been approached.</p>

<p>After a preliminary exchange of amenities, at the Acting Secretary’s invitation, the Defense Minister commented on the decision of Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> to offer himself as a candidate for the Presidency of the Federal Republic as follows:</p>
<p>Newspaper speculation that the Chancellor was ill, or that he was driven to his decision by tensions within his own party are wholly wrong. The Chancellor’s health remains unbroken and there is no tension between the Chancellor and his party. What happened was that during Easter, after due deliberation, the Chancellor concluded that his physical and mental strength would be too soon exhausted if he remained on as Chancellor. Moreover, if he were to be suddenly removed from the scene the confusion thereby generated would work harm to the interests of his party and his policies. He, therefore, decided to relieve himself of the burden of the Chancellorship.</p>
<p>As President, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> would be in a position to propose a new chancellor, and to use his moral authority as President to give continuity and stability to his policies. There will, in fact, said Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName>, be no change in the Federal Republic’s basic policies resulting from the Chancellor’s decision.</p>
<p>As to the Chancellor’s successor, only Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> are serious candidates. Both are supporters of the Chancellor’s foreign policy.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_620" n="620" facs="0645"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is more liberal in economic matters and a proponent of a free trade zone. The Chancellor is for the European Economic Community, and fears that damage would occur to French-German relationships if <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>’s concepts were to be adopted. The Chancellor is therefore “51%” for <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName> to succeed him. The Party and the Bundestag <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> faction support <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, and the Minister gave it as his opinion that <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> would become Chancellor in the end.</p>
<p>The Minister then expressed his sympathy for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and the gratitude which the German people owed to him. He remarked on the close personal friendship between the Chancellor and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and suggested that the Chancellor would no doubt be extremely depressed about the news of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ resignation.</p>
<p>The conversation then turned to the Berlin crisis, with the Minister remarking that he had been encouraged by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s optimism on its outcome and expressed the view that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would not risk a war over Berlin. The Acting Secretary said that no one wants war, but unless we were willing to go to war, there was a great danger of war which might arise from miscalculations. The Minister pointed out that the concept of disengagement was extremely dangerous. In the end the Germans would slide out of the alliance if any disengagement scheme were put into effect. Moreover, without a solution of the Berlin problem, disengagement concepts were dangerous, since the Russians were in a position to blackmail the West every year. Military solutions without political settlements were worse than worthless. The Acting Secretary said he was concerned about the problem of civilian access to Berlin.</p>
<p>The Minister said the Germans had learned through intelligence sources that <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> had last year been very depressed and had told <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> he could not keep the East German regime stable without support from the Soviet Union. People were constantly leaving the Soviet Zone. Laws had been passed to punish flight from the Zone, including laws which require individuals, under penalty, to denounce others whom they know are preparing to leave.</p>
<p>According to the Minister, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has two aims. The first is to break Western influence in Berlin and eliminate the continuing danger that Berlin represents to the Communist cause. The second is to use the Berlin crisis as blackmail to bring about a summit conference. At a summit conference the Soviet Union hopes for bilateral discussions with the United States. Their aim is to isolate the United States from its European allies who in turn, would, in desperation, turn to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Minister thanked the Acting Secretary for the courtesies which had been shown him in the United States, praised the good relationships between <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Germany and the Minister of Defense, and remarked on the openmindedness of everyone he had talked to. He concluded by telling the Acting Secretary that the agreement under 144 b of the <pb xml:id="pg_621" n="621" facs="0646"/>Atomic Energy Act had been agreed in principle,<note n="2" xml:id="d264fn2">For text of the agreement signed at Bonn on May 5 regarding cooperation between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany on the uses of atomic energy for mutual defense, see 10 UST 1322.....</note> and that on the general question of the arming of the Bundeswehr with atomic weapons, no important political question really continued to persist in Germany. Once the decision had been taken the problem largely disappeared from the political scene. The Germans, the Minister said, were ready to renounce modern weapons, but only in the context of a world-wide disarmament solution (for which there was no real hope) or a satisfactory solution of the problem of European security.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762B.5411/4–1759)</note> Original objectives of C–130 flights as proposed last year were to assert right to fly above 10,000 feet, test Soviet reactions <pb xml:id="pg_622" n="622" facs="0647"/>and open up higher altitudes for regular USAFE flights and if possible eventually for commercial flights. At that time we had British and French support for such a program.</p>
<p>The timing of recent C–130 flights brought new elements into picture, namely relationship between flights and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s conference. As result, Soviets took formal governmental notice of flights and played up political aspects of operation in relation to that conference.

<p>I therefore feel strongly that flights over 10,000 feet should not be repeated at least before April 29 <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s meeting, where the matter should be tripartitely discussed. We should first come to understanding with British and French, and demonstrate a united front at Geneva by taking initiative in raising corridor issue with Soviets.

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762B.5411/4–1659)</note> Paris for Embassy, <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> was my week-end guest and high-flights into Berlin most prominent subject discussed. He began by expressing irritation that he had been accused of sowing discord between <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> on this subject because his one abiding determination was to smooth over disagreements of this sort whenever they arose. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> added that when in Washington he and <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> had agreed that high-flights could provoke Soviet reaction and should be conducted with discretion.<note n="2" xml:id="d267fn2">See <ref target="#d248">Document 248</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> that he had secured postponement of <pb xml:id="pg_623" n="623" facs="0648"/>second high-flight and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had so told members of his Foreign Office staff. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> stated further that Foreign Office press briefing on this subject (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 5370)<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">Telegram 5370, April 16, reported on an April 15 Foreign Office Press Department off-the-record backgrounder that reflected British nervousness about the high altitude flights to Berlin. (Department of State, Central Files, 762B.5411/4–1659)</note> may have construed recurrence of high-flights as indicating disagreement between State Dept. and other elements of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, or indeed journalists present may have invented the story out of whole-cloth.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> added, however, that in his opinion the unfortunate suggestion that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> opposed American action over high-flights and believed State Dept. had been over-ruled by Pentagon on this matter had been planted in Washington rather than in London. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Despite this statement, I judge from the protracted way in which <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> ruminated over this subject that he felt somewhat on defensive. <hi rend="italic">End comment.</hi></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> stated that in replying to House of Commons questions he would state that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> were in full agreement that high-flights should be conducted with discretion. I suggested somewhat stronger wording indicating that the high-flights in fact had been conducted discreetly but elicited no specific comment. Since subject of high-flights is far down list of questions for reply during question period April 22, this topic may not be reached and may have faded somewhat from public mind on next occasion Foreign Secretary answers questions, April 27.<note n="4" xml:id="d267fn4"><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> answered written questions on the flights on April 20 and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs John Profumo answered oral questions on May 4. For texts of these replies, see 604 House of Commons, <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Debates</hi>, 5th Series, cols. 6–7 and 605 <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., cols. 23–24.</note></p>
<p>Meanwhile partial change has occurred over week-end in treatment of high-flights by some newspapers and is not likely that this change is entirely spontaneous. For example, <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, after discussing high-flights with Embassy officers, stated April 17 that “it is possible . . .<note n="5" xml:id="d267fn5">All ellipses in the source text.</note> to put up good arguments (for and against high-flights). It seems highly doubtful, however, whether British well advised to press their view to point of making it serious issue between two countries. Impression this gives to world is one of Britain unwilling to take any risks in face of Soviet threats. This belief ... carries far more dangers to Western unity than any incident likely to arise (from high-flights).”</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Sunday Observer</hi> which had strongly criticized influence of Pentagon on US foreign policy decisions stated somewhat piously April 19th that “it is doubtful if section of British press has done much service to Western Alliance by showing such excessive alarm over American decision <pb xml:id="pg_624" n="624" facs="0649"/>to fly occasional transport plane above 10,000 feet . . . over air corridor to Berlin.</p>

<p>Present at this Special Meeting of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> were the President of the United States, presiding; the Vice President of the United States; the Secretary of State; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretary of the Treasury; the Attorney General; and the Director, U.S. Information Agency. Also attending the meeting were the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Director of Central Intelligence; the Deputy Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of State; the Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs; the White House Staff Secretary; the Assistant White House Staff Secretary; the Executive Secretary, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>; and the Deputy Executive Secretary, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>.</p>
<p>There follows a summary of the discussion at the meeting and the main points taken.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> explained the purpose of this Special <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting and the general nature of the papers to be discussed. He suggested that the members of the Council bear in mind the final question which would be put to them; namely what if any of the contents of these two papers<note n="1" xml:id="d268fn1">Reference is to enclosures 1 and 2 to <ref target="#d265">Document 265</ref>.</note> <pb xml:id="pg_625" n="625" facs="0650"/>should subsequently be transmitted to our Allies? He also noted that the President had already approved transmission of the studies to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> for his use in preparing preliminary U.S. positions in the Tripartite Staff in Paris (Live Oak). Thereafter, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> suggested that the Council take up the so-called military paper entitled: “An Analysis of the Political and Military Implications of Alternative Uses of Force to Maintain Access to Berlin”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> thought it would be more useful to ask for comment on the main sections of this paper rather than to attempt to go through it paragraph by paragraph. (A copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s briefing note is filed in the Minutes of the Meeting and another is attached to this Memorandum).<note n="2" xml:id="d268fn2">Not printed.</note></p>
<p>Upon completing his introductory remarks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> inquired whether there were any comments on the introductory section of the military paper. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> merely stated that the paper was an agreed paper. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then inquired if there were any comments to be made on the Third Section entitled: “Preparatory and Supporting Actions” covering Pages 4 to 10 of the paper. There being no immediate comment, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out the bracketed phrase in Paragraph 13 suggested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and reading as follows:</p>
<p>“Thus, ‘Shield Force’ elements in Central Europe which are actually displaced in support of any Berlin operation, should be replaced with units in kind [or the risk of mal-deployment accepted]”<note n="3" xml:id="d268fn3">Brackets in the source text.</note></p>
<p>He asked General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> to explain why the Joint Chiefs had felt it desirable to add this phrase whereas the majority had apparently not felt it necessary to include the phrase.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>, turning to the President, indicated that the President had brought up this question once before. The purpose of the Joint Chiefs was here simply to call attention to the risk of mal-deployment.</p>
<p>The President said he wanted to inquire in the first place what purpose would be served by moving these forces toward the Western end of the Soviet Zone of Germany. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> replied that all such forces would be used on the Autobahn to break the Soviet blockade if it were instituted. The President commented that this would mean the Reinforced Battalion. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> answered in the affirmative and added “or perhaps a reinforced division.” The President said that if we were now getting forces of the size of a reinforced division, it was a pretty serious matter. He added that if we were going to make such significant military moves in, and/or toward the Corridor, such moves must be specifically brought to the attention of the Secretary of Defense and himself before they were taken. This was especially true of the <pb xml:id="pg_626" n="626" facs="0651"/>movement of a force of division size. We are involved here, said the President, with mounting a threat against the Soviet Union without having at our disposal a really great force with which to confront the forces which the Soviet Union would be in a position to confront us with.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> observed that these matters raised the whole question of the timing of these various moves. The timing of these moves had not been specified or agreed to in the paper under discussion. However, if the question of reinforcement of our troops should arise, timing would become a vital matter and we would have to be prepared to go a very long way. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that this problem could be discussed later. The question of timing was certainly rather fuzzy now.</p>
<p>The President stated that Section A, covering political action under the general heading of Section Three on “Preparatory and Supporting Actions” bothered him a little. While the political actions to be taken are specifically listed, nothing is said in this section with respect to <hi rend="italic">how</hi> these actions are to be carried out. For example, asked the President, would publicity be given to this series of political actions? When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> replied that publicity would be given to them, the President asked what kind of publicity? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> answered that the publicity would consist of high-level speeches as well as publicity by the U.S. Information Agency and in other forums. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AG1">George Allen</persName>, the Director of U.S.I.A., reminded the Council that his Agency would have to tie in its work to preliminary public speeches by U.S. officials. U.S.I.A. could not handle the publicity on these political actions independently of the guidance provided by official speeches. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> confined himself to stating that a great deal more had to be done on both of these papers by way of detail.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that the discussion had now reached the First of the Four Alternative Courses of Action; namely, “A Substantial Effort to Re-Open Ground Access by Local Action.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out on Page 15 a difference in the Intelligence Estimate of the response which we might expect from the Soviets if we undertook this First Alternative. Air Force Intelligence (A–2) believed that this course of action would convince the Soviets that the Western Allies were prepared if necessary to proceed to General War, and that the Soviets would therefore find ways to ease the crisis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that this difference of view was one factor to be considered if this paper were to be transmitted to other Allied Governments. In such a case, he asked, should these splits in Intelligence Estimates be reflected at all? If they were to be reflected, should the identity of those who held the differing views be made clear or alternatively should just the Majority Estimate be provided to the other Governments?</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> stressed the very great importance of the Intelligence Estimates in the paper. He added that it was his personal view <pb xml:id="pg_627" n="627" facs="0652"/>that if we carried out the First Alternative now under discussion, the Soviets were likely to fight unless they were really prepared to let our military forces, either of battalion or division size, move down the Autobahn into Berlin. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> wondered whether it would not be possible to express the Majority view and the Dissent in rather generalized terms. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> thought that General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>’s suggestion was a good one but advised against identifying the source of Dissents in the Intelligence Estimates. He suggested that the paper just provide the Minority view as one which differed from the Majority Intelligence Estimate. If the paper were to be given to the French, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> urged that it be “sanitized” first.</p>
<p>The President said that he had asked several people about giving such papers such as this to our Allies. It was all right to provide this paper to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> to look into but if the papers were to go any further, should they not be transmitted in rather more general terms than in the detailed fashion in which they were now written?</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> expressed the opinion that all such papers would have to be transmitted in a sanitized version. The President expressed his agreement in favor of shorter papers summarizing the contents of the more detailed ones.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out to the Council that while over the years the British have been very anxious to engage with the U.S. in contingency military planning all over the world, they have been firm in the one exception as to joint contingency planning on Berlin. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> confirmed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s statement of the British attitude while Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that we ourselves had not desired at first to join with the British in contingency planning until we had gotten further along in our own plans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that the President would want to determine when we should go forward with joint contingency planning on Berlin. He specifically inquired whether the paper under discussion should be transmitted to the Tripartite Staff in Paris (Live Oak). Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> suggested holding off a decision on this point until further discussion of the Group here. It might be desirable to transmit the paper through diplomatic channels to our Allies.</p>
<p>There being no further discussion of Alternative One, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> directed the Council’s attention to the Second Alternative; namely, “A Substantial Effort to Re-Open Air Access, if Blocked.” As in the case of the First Alternative, he noted that this Alternative also involved a difference in the Intelligence Estimate of the reaction which we might expect from the Soviets if this Alternative were attempted (Page 21). He suggested that the same considerations should apply in the case of this split as applied in the case of the split Estimate as to the First Alternative.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then referred to the Third Alternative, that is, “Reprisals Against the Communists in Other Areas, e.g., Western Naval Controls <pb xml:id="pg_628" n="628" facs="0653"/>on Bloc Shipping.” Initially Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> pointed out that the same problem of timing existed with respect to this Alternative as with the first two Alternatives. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> called attention to the footnote on Page 26 reading as follows: “There is a serious question as to whether one or more of such actions would constitute retaliation, which is regarded as belligerent action”. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that he himself believed that some of the suggested actions under this Alternative might be called aggressive and belligerent. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> expressed agreement with this view of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> proceeded to the Fourth Alternative: “General War Measures”. Here again he pointed out that there was a difference of opinion as to the Intelligence Estimate on the reaction to be expected from the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Governments if the Fourth Alternative were undertaken (Page 34). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> commented that this time the Dissent came from the State Department rather than from the Military Intelligence Agencies.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> inquired specifically of the Attorney General whether he had any comment to make on this Fourth Alternative, pointing out that when we become involved in General War Measures, we are getting into the business of the duties and prerogatives of the Commander-in-Chief vis-à-vis the U.S. Congress. The Attorney General replied that he did not believe that this Alternative presented any great problem. A great deal of contingency planning had already been done—more than had ever been done in our history before this time. This he thought was not really a legal problem so much as a problem of public reaction to undertaking General War Measures. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> replied that he thought this matter extremely important from the point of view of the President’s approval of these papers. Mr. Rogers promised to review the issue again but stated that he was confident that no severe problems would emerge. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that of course each move in these papers was subject to the President’s approval.</p>
<p>At this point the President brought the discussion back to the Third Alternative, that of reprisals against the Communists in other areas, and said that he felt that the Third Alternative was somewhat out of line. He feared that if we undertook such reprisals as were listed under this Alternative, we would manage to get the whole world peeved at us without actually improving our own situation. He said he was quite convinced that with respect to the First Alternative on ground access that the U.S. must be fully prepared to act. However, through this committee here or by asking Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> we must secure agreement from both the British and the French to “Show the Flag” and make it clear that we were serious. However, if we contemplate going beyond the First Alternative in our military actions as opposed to our political actions, we should realize that the situation will be changing day by day.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_629" n="629" facs="0654"/>
<p>That is, if we undertake military action on a larger scale and at a further stage than that of the Reinforced Battalion, we would encounter new problems and the need for new decisions. In such a contingency we here in the National Security Council would be meeting regularly. In short, said the President, we cannot expect to be able to respond automatically, in these contingencies, to rigid plans of action which we had made in advance. We simply would be unable to see the results. For example, said the President, would we be willing to start a war without the support of our allies? If we do so, the President believed such action would constitute a great Soviet victory. Therefore, said the President, anything we do after we make our first move (Alternative One) is going to have to be played by ear.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that of course <gloss target="#t_CINCEUR1">CINCEUR</gloss> was well aware of the points that the President had made. The President went on to say that of course if we undertook the First Alternative, we would reinforce our moves to gain ground access to Berlin with air operations. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> observed that the main thing was to stir up the Tripartite Group in <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s Headquarters in Paris to get down to work. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> commented that of course the military courses of action must be dove-tailed with the political courses of action. He felt reasonably sure, he said, that our Allies would go along with our proposed military actions if they are convinced that we had exhausted all the other possibilities.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> again came back to the problem of reprisals. He pointed out that there was one type of naval reprisal which we might well consider and which might not seem too belligerent. If the Soviets held up one of our Berlin convoys we could retaliate by holding one Soviet merchant vessel, on one pretext or another, in an Allied port. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> was quite sure that the Soviets would deduce the meaning of such an action. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> thought this was a useful idea but of reprisals in general, under Alternative Three, he pointed out that the three Allied Governments had definite legal rights with respect to access to Berlin. On the other hand, if we held up Soviet shipping on the high seas, we could not do so on the basis of any clear legal right. The President said that he would not object to limited harassments of the sort suggested by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> next inquired whether the same considerations would not apply to Alternative Two as applied to Alternative One with respect to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s planning. In reply the President pointed out that obviously we could not conduct an air battle in a ten-mile wide corridor. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, however, pointed out that we could likewise not conduct a ground battle on an autobahn strip. Agreeing, the President pointed out that both contingencies required space sufficient for a campaign. Amid considerable laughter, General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> pointed out that the paper under <pb xml:id="pg_630" n="630" facs="0655"/>consideration required us to confine our military action to the Corridor if possible.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> then invited the Council’s attention to the final section of the paper: “Reactions within Germany to the Four Courses of Action.” There being no comment or discussion on this section, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> turned to the President and said he supposed that the President would wish to approve this paper in principle as the basis for further work by the four agencies which had prepared the paper (State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>). The President replied in the affirmative and added that he would send the paper to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>. He would not object to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> mentioning these Alternatives in discussions with the Tripartite Group but in so doing he should make clear that as of the present moment these actions are not all practical.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> inquired whether we should omit Alternative Three in any material which we transmit to our Allies. The President thought it would be a good idea to omit this Alternative but we should get at it by asking our Allies what they could suggest by way of reprisals and harassments.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> reminded the Council that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Robert Murphy</persName> in his covering memorandum<note n="4" xml:id="d268fn4"><ref target="#d265">Document 265</ref>.</note> sending these two studies to the President had asked the President to approve three recommendations. He singled out in particular the third recommendation dealing with the problem of the selection and timing of the general political, economic, and military measures outlined in these studies. Thereafter he asked the President whether he would wish to have progress reports from time to time on this recommendation. The President said he would but added that he did not feel that much effective work could be done at the present time unless a single individual was appointed and given authority to look over the whole range of our contingency planning on Berlin. This range would include also any Allied suggestions because, said the President, we need solid support and agreement from our Allies. The President then suggested that the individual who could most effectively fill this job would be Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Robert Murphy</persName> of the State Department. If he were not available, some other State Department official should be selected because, as the President said, in the early stages at least much of what we would be doing with respect to counter-measures in the Berlin crisis would be in the realm of political planning and action. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> concurred in the President’s view that the individual to have charge of such a group should come from the State Department.</p>
<p>The President said that the group meeting under Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> should convene every day and should as necessary check with the National <pb xml:id="pg_631" n="631" facs="0656"/>Security Council. The President added that he was assuming in making this suggestion that Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had really meant what he said when he stated that he was not going to upset the applecart once negotiations over Berlin had been started between the West and the U.S.S.R.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> indicated that this seemed to conclude the discussion of the first paper and suggested that the Council turn its attention to the second paper, non-military, entitled: “Analysis of Non-Military Measures to Induce the Soviet Union to Remove Obstructions to Western Access to Berlin”. He promptly called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> for a summary of the contents of this paper.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that the summary and conclusions of the paper were provided in the first four pages. Most of the courses of action presented in the paper were to be studied as possibilities. None of them is necessarily going to change the mind of the Soviet Union but at least they should all be discussed with our Allies. More work was certainly needed on the question of the role of the United Nations in the picture. What precisely, for example, is meant by the phrase “a United Nations presence in Berlin”? This was still a very fuzzy concept. Incidentally, added Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, the French attitude toward any United Nations’ participation in the Berlin problem was positively psychopathic. Nevertheless from the point of view of world public relations, the role of the United Nations can still be of great importance.</p>
<p>The President said he found the course of action set forth on Page 16 of the paper, that is “Termination of Non-Diplomatic Contacts with the U.S.S.R.” quite an interesting problem. The President wondered what the Soviets would infer from a break in relations between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. They might well consider this break tantamount to a declaration of war. Moreover, such a break, effected by the U.S. alone, would not carry very much weight. With respect to the paper as a whole, the President suggested that we should try to set down our questions and answers in very short and terse form. He said that he had studied this particular paper at considerable length but even so had found it difficult to reach clear and firm conclusions with respect to its content.</p>
<p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (19–1/2 lines of source text) not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p>The President said that looking at the Berlin crisis as a whole, he felt that one of three eventualities could come to pass. The first would be some kind of a deal through negotiations between the Soviet Bloc and the West. The best we could hope for in such a deal would be Soviet agreement to maintain the status quo for three or four years. The second possibility was a backdown by the U.S.S.R. The third possibility was general war. The President went on to warn that once we resort to the use of military force, as opposed to political action, there are really no limits that can be set to the use of force. This was a fact that the President <pb xml:id="pg_632" n="632" facs="0657"/>felt we must look squarely in the face. The President said he was reminded of the circumstances of 1916 when President Wilson would not even permit our little War College to make any studies about what we might do if we became involved in the War. Nor would he permit any contingency war planning by the War or the Navy Departments lest such planning seem to constitute belligerent action by the U.S. Today we are of course taking the opposite course. Certainly there were a number of things we could try to do to change the Soviet mind but we should never forget the possibility of war even though in the President’s judgment there would not be war.</p>

<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said he had been wondering whether it would be possible for members of the State Department to approach leaders of both parties of the Congress with suggestions that they make statements on the floor of the House or the Senate with respect to our course of action on Berlin. The statements he had in mind, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>, would not be cast in a belligerent form but would be designed as an indication of the firm resolution of the U.S. If such statements were carefully prepared and delivered, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> believed that they would constitute a source of strength for the U.S. position at the forthcoming Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. They would also serve the purpose of preparing the people of the U.S. for all the eventualities they faced. Lastly, such statements would help Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen</persName> and the U.S.I.A. to mobilize world opinion in defense of the U.S. and the Western position.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> commented that he believed that the President’s recent speech<note n="5" xml:id="d268fn5">See <ref target="#d225">Document 225</ref>.</note> had done the best job in explaining the problem of Berlin to the people of the country.

<p>Reverting to the idea originally suggested by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName>, the President said that he did believe that it would be desirable to get Representatives and Senators on both sides of the aisle to make speeches to explain why we were proposing to provide our Allies with these atomic weapons. Such speeches should stress the defensive character of our proposed action.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that the Joint Committee would have to approve the agreements by which these deployments were carried out. The President thought that if we made such agreements, there was bound to be a certain amount of revelation of atomic energy information.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> was invited to clarify the understanding of what was involved in such agreements. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> said that the agreements <pb xml:id="pg_633" n="633" facs="0658"/>which would have to be approved by the Joint Committee were not agreements which would allow us to put atomic stockpiles on the soil of our foreign Allies. The agreements which require the approval of the Committee were those which involved the exchange of atomic information which would enable our Allies to do what they have to do with these weapons once they were deployed. The matter of deployment of the weapons was a matter between governments, but as for the agreements necessary to provide our Allies with information essential to the use of these weapons, this was something which required the approval of the Congressional Committee. The Committee can consider such an agreement and hold it up for sixty days although Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> did not believe that the Committee was required to consider the matter for the full sixty days.<note n="6" xml:id="d268fn6">It is uncertain whether Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName>’ point is correct. It may be mandatory for the Joint Committee to withhold action for a period of sixty days after receipt of a proposed agreement made by the Executive Branch with a foreign government. [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>
<p>The Vice President observed that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had made a good point in suggesting speeches by Congressmen and Senators about our position in the Berlin crisis. Nevertheless, as far as public opinion of this country was concerned, the President’s speech on the Berlin crisis had been much the most effective statement thus far. Members of Congress, for example Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>, have already talked a great deal about the Berlin crisis. In these circumstances the Vice President believed that Berlin might be the subject of the first public statement by our new Secretary of State. This would be bound to have a very considerable effect—much more effect than any speech by any member of Congress, however distinguished.</p>
<p>The President said he thought very well of the Vice President’s proposal. Such a speech by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> could well take the form of a talk to the people in a homely fashion. It should be designed to explain the continuity of our policy; it should avoid inciting to fear and instead stress the continuity of our firm policy with regard to Berlin.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> suggested that if he were to make such a speech, it should be made after he returned from the April 29 meetings in Paris but before he went back to Geneva for the Foreign Ministers’ Conference opening on May 11. The Vice President commented that he thought well of the proposed timing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> suggested the Council on Foreign Relations as a good forum. The Vice President commented that his proposal for a speech by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> did not of course exclude speeches afterwards on the floor of the House of the Senate.</p>
<p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> summed up what he understood to be the action of the Council on these two papers.</p>

<p>1. Noted and discussed the two studies prepared at the direction of the President and enclosed with the reference memorandum for the President.</p>
<p>2. Noted that the President has previously approved the transmission of the studies to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> for his use in preparing preliminary U.S. positions in the Tripartite Staff in Paris.</p>
<p>3. Noted the President’s view that, with respect to the study of military measures, any advance planning regarding the alternative uses of force would necessarily be subject to review and decision in the light of circumstances as they develop.</p>
<p>4. Agreed that the studies in their present form should not be transmitted to our allies, and that any disclosures to our allies with respect to these studies should be deferred pending further study under 6-c below.</p>
<p>5. Noted the President’s approval, subject to the above caveats, of the utilization of the study of alternative courses of action regarding use of force by the Department of Defense as a basis for the initial planning of measures to be taken on a national basis.</p>
<p>6. Noted the President’s approval in principle of the studies for use in further planning under the coordination of a group to be chaired by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Robert Murphy</persName>, Deputy Under Secretary of State, with representatives from the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and, as necessary on an ad hoc basis, other agencies. Specifically, this group should, in the light of the discussion at this special meeting, coordinate such further planning, including:</p>

<head>OTHERS PRESENT</head>
<item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_GBGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName></item>
</list>
<p>The President, referring to the session earlier in the day on contingency planning for access to Berlin,<note n="1" xml:id="d269fn1">See <ref target="#d268">Document 268</ref>.</note> asked that thorough studies be prepared along the lines of the papers presented,<note n="2" xml:id="d269fn2">See <ref target="#d265">Document 265</ref>.</note> but that this be followed by a presentation of the gist of the matter for discussion out of which should then evolve a very short paper of “directive type.” It is not too helpful to have long, analytical papers with conclusions scattered through them. In many cases, the use of charts and graphs is helpful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> agreed that where graphs could be used he would try to see that this is done.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then reported that he is leaving Monday evening, the 27th, for the 4-power working meeting of the Western Foreign Ministers in Paris. He said that the working group which has been meeting still has a number of unsolved issues before it. He said he would like to come in again and see the President on Monday just prior to departing. A discussion of some of the issues still open then followed. The first is on German reunification. The Germans do not want to go as far as we do, apparently in part out of fear that elections would result in a victory of the Socialist party. The President said he is not so concerned about such considerations; the best we can do is leave it to the Germans to govern themselves.</p>
<p>Disarmament is the second issue. The French do not want to agree to force levels to which they have previously agreed. The President thought we should recognize their problem, which is undoubtedly linked to their difficulties in Algeria, and increased need for troops. The President asked whether we have a well-developed proposal for an inspection system for a disarmament agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> indicated that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> has drawn up a good plan for this.</p>
<p>A third issue relates to the link between German reunification and European security measures. Until the weekend it seemed that the British were very weak on the necessity to keep an effective link; now it appears that they have come around to our point of view although they may shift again during the negotiations.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_636" n="636" facs="0661"/>
<p>The next issue relates to the possibility of restrictions on the deployment of <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s in Germany. The President thought there might be some gain to be made by agreeing not to put them forward to the Rhine inasmuch as militarily we would probably not think it sound to put them there anyhow. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> indicated that Defense is nervous on this point, since a ban on deploying <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>s in Germany might lead to a ban on their manufacture.</p>
<p>The next issue is really a question—as to what we should try to do concerning assurances against surprise attack. The President said that here his thinking is that any agreement that both sides can check on with confidence is all to the good, even though the scope of the agreement is very limited.</p>
<p>The next issue pertains to a possible role for the U.N. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said the French are almost psychopathic in opposition to this. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName>, however, thinks that at some stage the conferees may want the United Nations to help in a solution.<note n="3" xml:id="d269fn3"><persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> from 11:20 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. April 23 at the Secretary-General’s request. A memorandum of their conversation along the lines indicated in this paragraph is in Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/4–2359.</note> He pointed out that the United Nations has never had experience in supervising elections. They might be able to take on some task which is simple and definitive such as taking over the posts on the access routes from the Soviets. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said there is also some reason to think that holding a summit conference through the U.N. machinery may be helpful. The President commented, however, that although there might be some tie to the United Nations, on any question where we are hoping to get real agreement the fewer participants the better. For the summit meeting, he thought the attendance must be held down to the top four countries. The Security Council is too large and has too many extraneous interests.</p>
<p>The next issue is on tactics, and specifically whether there should be publicity in advance of the May 11th meeting concerning the Western “package” position, perhaps three or four days ahead of the meeting. The President said there is one danger in this—which is the danger of revealing your hole card in a poker game in advance of the play. He recognized that there are reasons on the other side—to carry world opinion—and thought that it would be good to put out a persuasive document stating our purposes and principles, and giving just a hint of the specifics. He thought we should not, however, be appearing to enter the negotiations on a “this or else” basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> commented that we would be putting our statement out as the main elements of our initial position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> suggested that this material could very well be put out in a speech by the Secretary on his return from the meeting on the <pb xml:id="pg_637" n="637" facs="0662"/>29th. He would be in position to speak rather freely—without the necessity of getting allied agreement on the text.</p>
<p>The next issue pertains to our plan for Berlin. The representatives of all four countries had agreed upon a unified Berlin with free elections, but the British and French are now indicating that they favor the status quo. The President said we are reaching the point where it becomes quite important to know what the Berliners really want. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> commented that the only thing that keeps the Berliners resolute is the presence of Western forces there. The President commented that it would be foolish to try to settle the Berlin issue by itself. We must seek an over-all German solution in which Berlin becomes simply an element. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> confirmed that this is our stand, and we will seek to keep these linked.</p>
<p>The last issue raised is whether we should put forward the text of a peace treaty or just the principles for a peace treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> commented that our allies are showing some signs now of not wanting to put forward even the principles of the treaty, but he thought it was necessary to have something concrete to show our seriousness of purpose.</p>
<p>In commenting on the prospects for the 4-power meeting next week, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he thought we will come out with a less imaginative plan than we had hoped for, but even so, a very solid and constructive one. The President asked that the group be trying to think of some feature that would be new and striking. He mentioned as examples his “Open Skies” proposal at Geneva,<note n="4" xml:id="d269fn4">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s “Open Skies” proposal at the Heads of Government meeting at Geneva in July 1955, see <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 63, July 21, 1955, <ref target="frus1955-57v05"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, vol. V</ref>, pp. 447–156.</note> and his idea of inviting 10,000 Russian youths to come to the United States for a year of schooling.<note n="5" xml:id="d269fn5">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s proposal to invite thousands of Russian youths to the United States, see vol. X, Part 2, <ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>.</note></p>
<p>The President also suggested dividing up the various topics, and assigning several to the individual Western leaders. For example, have <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> speak for the West on some particular points, etc.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> next raised the point of possible Congressional attendance at the Foreign Ministers conference on May 11th. He said that Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> is opposed to this, as he is.<note n="6" xml:id="d269fn6">Following the meeting with the President, <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> agreed that there would be no Senatorial representation at the Foreign Ministers meeting. (Memorandum of conversation, April 23 at 6 p.m.; Department of State, Central Files, 762A.00/4–2359)</note> The President strongly agreed that it is better to avoid this, particularly inasmuch as the meeting is not engaged in drafting a treaty that would subsequently have to go to the Senate.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_638" n="638" facs="0663"/>
<p>The President recalled that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has said that he would be glad to go to Vienna or San Francisco. He reiterated that if the meetings were to drag out, he would have to drop out occasionally in order to keep up with the Executive work, in which case he would bring in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to spell him.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he thought he would like to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> attend the Foreign Ministers conference with him. It might be best for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> to come in after the initial meetings had been held. He indicated he was contemplating that the meetings might run for something like three weeks in duration.</p>

<head>270. Editorial Note</head>
<p>Acting on instructions from the Foreign Ministers (see <ref target="#d251">Document 251</ref>), the Four-Power Working Group resumed its deliberations, this time at London, in an attempt to iron out the points among the four Western powers that were still unagreed. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LJ1">Laloy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HPF1">Hancock</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BGGV1">von Baudissin</persName> continued as the heads of the United States, French, British, and West German Delegations, respectively. By April 22 an agreed draft report was completed for the Foreign Ministers as well as a summary report on the work of the group that was given to the North Atlantic Council on April 23. (Telegram 5520 from London, April 22; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/4–2259) For extract from the draft report, April 23, see <ref target="#d271">Document 271</ref>.</p>
<p>The North Atlantic Council discussed the draft report at its meeting on April 27 (see <ref target="#d275">Document 275</ref>) and the Foreign Ministers of the United States, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom devoted four meetings to the report, April 29–30. (See <ref target="#d280">Documents 280</ref>–<ref target="#d282">282</ref>) A copy of the final report, comprising: 1) “The Phased Plan for German Reunification, European Security and a German Peace Settlement,” 2) “Preliminary Draft Principles of a German Peace Settlement,” 3) “Tactics at a Foreign Ministers Conference” with four annexes, and 4) “Berlin,” is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1276.

<p>In fulfillment of the directions given to them by the four Ministers in Washington on April l,<note n="1" xml:id="d271fn1">See <ref target="#d251">Document 251</ref>.</note> the Working Group has prepared:</p>
<list>
<item>1. a. A revision of the “Phased Plan for German Reunification and European Security and a German Peace Settlement”,</item>
<item>b. Preliminary Draft Principles of a Peace Treaty,</item>
<item>2. Proposals on Berlin,</item>
<item>3. A paper on Tactics at a Foreign Ministers’ Conference,</item>
<item>4. A statement to the North Atlantic Council.</item>
<item>While the Working Group has reached a large identity of view, there are nevertheless certain questions in the attached papers on which an agreed direction must now be sought from Ministers.</item>
</list>
<p><hi rend="italic">1. Security and Disarmament</hi></p>
<p>(a) In what terms should the connection be expressed between general disarmament on the one hand and European security and German reunification on the other hand? In particular, can a measure of general disarmament (overall force levels and arms reduction for the Four Powers) be introduced into the plan? Alternatively, should the plan provide for a parallel negotiation about general disarmament?</p>
<p>(b) Should provisions which are stated in general terms for measures against surprise attack allow for an alternative proposal limited to Europe and also for a specific proposal for ground inspection limited to a small area in Europe?</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_640" n="640" facs="0665"/>
<p>(c) Should a specific formula, for instance by reference to the Paris Agreements,<note n="2" xml:id="d271fn2">See <ref target="#d263fn4">footnote 4, Document 263</ref>.</note> or general language be used for limiting the strength of indigenous military forces in a defined area in Europe?</p>
<p>(d) Should a prohibition against the stationing of I.R.B.M.s in a defined area in Europe be included?</p>
<p>(e) Should Hungary be included in the area in Europe in which special security measures would be applied?</p>
<p>(f) Can and should the area in Europe in which special security measures would be applied be identified in other than political terms?</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">2. Berlin</hi></p>
<p>(a) What Berlin proposals should be made within the “phased plan”?</p>
<p>(b) In considering secondary solutions, i.e. solutions apart from the “phased plan”, could the Western Powers accept anything beyond the “agency theory”? Specifically, could they proceed from Solution C in the Berlin paper to Solution D.<note n="3" xml:id="d271fn3">Solution C outlined various declarations that the four occupying powers and the East Germans might make to ensure access to Berlin. Solution D stated that the Western powers would say that they intended to maintain their rights in Berlin under existing agreements and trusted that the Soviet Union would not interfere with them.</note> (Soviet-G.D.R. declarations?)</p>
<p>(c) Can a G.D.R. declaration of the type included in the final fallback proposal on Berlin be envisaged without moving too far in the direction of the recognition of the G.D.R.? If so, can the Western Powers take the initiative with the Soviets in obtaining this, or should this initiative suggesting such a G.D.R. declaration be left to the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>(d) What measures of United Nations participation, if any, can the Western Powers contemplate? Should the United Nations role include United Nations personnel to determine whether the declaration concerning free access and non-use of force are being fulfilled?</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">3. Tactics</hi></p>
<p>(a) Should the Western Powers give any publicity to the “phased plan” prior to the May 11 meeting?</p>
<p>(b) Should the Western Powers introduce the “phased plan” (or an indication of it) at the outset or should they hold it in reserve until they have been able, to some extent, to probe the Soviet position?</p>
<p>(c) If (a) has not been done, should the “phased plan” be publicised, either textually or in summary, when it is introduced?</p>
<p>(d) Should the Western Powers fully explore the “phased plan” with the Soviets and decide on its final disposition before any separate <pb xml:id="pg_641" n="641" facs="0666"/>discussion of Berlin? Or should they seek to have the Berlin question discussed before entering into a discussion of the phased plan?</p>
<p>(e) Should the Western Powers oppose any discussion of the Peace Treaty principles, permit only extremely limited discussion, or be prepared for a detailed discussion?</p>

<p>5639. Paris for Embassy, <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName>. On eve of Western Foreign Ministers Meeting Embassy believes it may be helpful offer general appreciation present UK Governmental and public attitudes toward Berlin and East-West negotiations. Embassy is mindful in this connection that recent diplomatic activity and public and private statements of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> have enhanced speculation that British becoming “soft” in face Soviet threats and that “Munich mood” is at large in country. This is not, however, our assessment British attitudes either on part of government or general public. Certainly there is no parallel between emphasis given by <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to negotiations with Soviet and Chamberlain’s efforts at appeasement. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and British Government under no illusions about menace of Soviet imperialism or character of Soviet leaders, nor do they expect negotiations to yield immediate and far reaching results.</p>
<p>Point of departure in <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s thinking appears to be his assessment of catastrophic consequences for humanity of nuclear war and his conviction that in present circumstances neither East nor West can or does contemplate deliberate resort to it. At same time actions of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> most notably over Berlin carry great danger of setting off chain reaction carrying world to brink. For UK with its small area, heavy population and proximity to Soviet military power possible consequences of nuclear exchange appear in sharp focus and explain in large part emotional content some of Prime Minister’s recent statements about effect very small number hydrogen bombs dropped on British <pb xml:id="pg_642" n="642" facs="0667"/>Isles. British feel US with large land mass and greater distance from Soviet Union for moment not as vulnerable and consequently perhaps not as mindful of danger in present situation nor of imperative necessity attempting find some basis, even temporary, for coexistence Communist empire and free world.</p>
<p>Prime Minister’s reasoning appears to be that if war is excluded because it is unthinkable in light character of weapons available to both sides, then it is incumbent upon both Soviet Union and West to seek modus vivendi through process of negotiation. Obvious that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> considers principal achievement his Moscow visit was to persuade <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to agree to negotiate. He does not believe that either <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> can be expected in present circumstances to make much of a contribution toward advancing objective of negotiations. US doubts regarding possibility reaching agreement with Soviets at Foreign Ministers or Summit meeting probably lead <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to conclude we may be more interested in disabusing our Allies of their illusions about prospects negotiations than in pursuing patiently and assiduously any possible point of agreement. In these circumstances <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> obviously is convinced that he owes it to his own people, to Western Alliance and to history to bring his own talents to bear in finding road to peace. Equally obviously as politician as well as statesman, he is not unmindful of fact that his recent efforts have been applauded by all sections of British public opinion even though they have been viewed with varying degrees of suspicion and reserve in other Western capitals. This places him in a dilemma from which perhaps he can hope to emerge only in course of negotiations themselves.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> is on record as stating negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> offer sole prospect of useful results in dealing with the Russians. Therefore Foreign Ministers’ meeting from his point of view has significance only because its complete failure, in view US attitude, would prejudice holding of Summit talks. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> recently has expressed opinion that what is required is continuous negotiating procedure punctuated from time to time with Summit meetings. This is consistent with his belief that while basic East-West differences are not negotiable at present time, it may nevertheless be possible to arrive at limited agreements reducing danger of conflict and purchasing time. This brings us to additional point which apparently impressed <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> greatly during his visit Soviet Union, namely great advance in standard of living of Russian people since his last visit some thirty years ago. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> sees in this improvement best long range hope for the West that aggressive, imperialistic character of Soviet Government will undergo internal changes causing it to become less of menace to rest of world.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_643" n="643" facs="0668"/>
<p>Fundamental problem arising from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> (also <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>) thinking as analysed above is, it seems to Embassy, that British pursuing traditional policies and tactics and fail to see desirability genuine confidence in nuclear deterrence to prevent war, although they profess concur in deterrent concept. Thus, as we see it, they are following traditional procedure of maximum negotiating effort with potential enemy and, also traditionally, are quite determined to be staunch in face of hostilities which may arise if negotiations fail or if enemy attacks. However the psychological imperatives of a massive retaliatory posture coupled with disposition to face up publicly to Soviets firmly in peacetime seem in fact to be beyond British grasp.</p>
<p>In Embassy’s opinion we have many problems before us inherent in the present strong desire of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> government to seek basis for agreement with Soviet Union and in sense of urgency which it brings to these endeavors. Undoubtedly we can anticipate differences to arise with UK during negotiations with Soviets. We do not believe, however, that these differences have their origin in weakened resolution or “Munich spirit” of UK. Furthermore there is no reason to believe that British Government has any doubts that fundamental basis of British security continues to lie in Anglo-American alliance nor that in final analysis UK, despite differences with U.S. on strategy and tactics, would permit such differences to override requirements Anglo-American partnership.</p>

<p>2398. Eyes only Secretary. I saw Chancellor yesterday at Cadenabbia.<note n="1" xml:id="d273fn1"><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was at Cadenabbia on vacation; his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> was held from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.</note> He asked me to communicate substance our discussion to you only.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had informal agenda four items: (1) new situation Washington; (2) his candidacy for Presidency; (3) prospects at <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> and Summit Conferences and, in this connection, remarks on the Working Group studies;<note n="2" xml:id="d273fn2">See <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>.</note> (4) situation in UK.</p>
<p>Re (1) In view Secretary’s departure Washington Monday and inability Chancellor send him letter from Italy before that time, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> wished me communicate to him his strong desire to establish constant and close relations with him. He will later initiate a regular correspondence with <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss>. He expects shortly to send letters to President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> [<hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName></hi>] expressing his views on pending problems.<note n="3" xml:id="d273fn3">Not found.</note></p>
<p>(2) He had decided to be candidate for Presidency in order to assure orderly transfer of power in advance of 1961 elections which will be bitterly contested by <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>. He said he expected arrange matters so that his foreign policies would be carried on by his successor. (It was evident he is confident he will continue to dominate political scene here as long as he is in good health.)<note n="4" xml:id="d273fn4">According to <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>’s diary the Chancellor also expressed some reservations about running for the Presidency and stated that he might continue as Chancellor. (Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D 327)</note></p>
<p>(3) He sees no prospect of any substantive agreements being reached at <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Conference or later at Summit Conference if such takes place. He thinks at both conferences the question of general controlled disarmament must be discussed. In regard to Working Group, I explained to him frankly the undesirable position in which his <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> had found himself, as result repudiation in Washington by <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> Govt of proposals initiated or agreed to by German Delegation Paris.</p>
<p>He answered he had not been informed of results of Working Group Paris<note n="5" xml:id="d273fn5">See <ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note> findings until too late to act otherwise than he had. He was out of sympathy with positions taken by his delegation and therefore <pb xml:id="pg_645" n="645" facs="0670"/>had given to <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> for presentation to the other <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s the orders with which you are familiar.</p>
<p>He has not yet seen papers prepared by Working Group London but his delegation there had been operating within framework of his instructions, and he has been kept generally informed as to what has transpired. He is seeing <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> on subject today in Cadenabbia, and he would appreciate if <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> would meet <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> Paris some time Tuesday.</p>
<p>(4) His chief preoccupation is over UK foreign policy. On April 20 <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> sent him summary of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s personal letter to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>.<note n="6" xml:id="d273fn6">For a summary of the letter from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, dated April 14, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s reply, and the summaries sent to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> (and his reply), and <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, see <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Riding the Storm</hi>, pp. 652–656.</note> <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> wrote <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> that this long document had as one objective driving of wedge between Allies, and that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had tried to go further than justified in interpreting <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>’s conversations with him in Moscow. The main point of <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>’s letter, according to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, was to propose a nonaggression pact between UK and USSR, having as its most important element agreement that US bases in UK should be maintained only limited period time.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> thought maybe there was element of genuineness in <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>’s letter and therefore wanted to continue their correspondence. <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> asked for <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s views on above.</p>
<p>Chancellor said at first he had been tempted to answer that <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> seemed to think UK might be induced to be disloyal to its allies, but had refrained from doing so, and would shortly reply to him and observe that if an exchange of letters between the two statesmen continues no good could be expected to come of it.</p>
<p>Chancellor spoke at length of his deep concern over UK foreign policy and especially what its representatives might say in debate at conference table. <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>, in his eagerness for Summit meeting, has already thrown away good cards. The three Western powers have thus far missed opportunity to obtain standstill concession from USSR in return for summit, and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> hopes they will nail this down before agreeing to such meeting. In his opinion <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> is thinking in antiquated European balance-of-power terms, and does not realize strength in Europe engendered by continental unity thus far achieved. It is evident he has profound distrust of UK firmness or ability in dealing with Soviets. He said he thought in Moscow there must have been serious negotiations between <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> which had given latter false impression of what might be done with West.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous remarks; I told Chancellor:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_646" n="646" facs="0671"/>
<p>(1) Paris Working Group papers never contemplated making proposal on confederation.</p>
<p>(2) Special security zone was always linked with reunification but it is not yet apparent what UK will finally decide in this regard.</p>
<p>(3) As to tactics, we are. puzzled by German Delegation in London insisting on talking about Berlin first, whereas we would like to use it as last resort.</p>
<p>(4) His repudiation of reunification issue has created a confused atmosphere.</p>
<p>(5) We have certain hesitations about <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> association with Berlin matter, since there is some danger of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, once sharing, going too far.</p>
<p>(6) I sought Chancellor’s views oh how he proposed answer most recent Soviet note.<note n="7" xml:id="d273fn7">For texts of the Soviet note to the Federal Republic, April 21, concerning the nuclear arming of West Germany, and the Federal Republic’s reply, May 9, see <hi rend="italic">Moskau Bonn</hi>, pp. 543–548; for texts of a similar note to the United States and the U.S. reply, May 8, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1959</hi>, pp. 517–519 and 521–522.</note></p>
<p>Chancellor answered:</p>
<p>(1) He understood we were opposed to confederation and was not worried about our position.</p>
<p>(2) He considered special security zone dangerous and does not like idea at all. It would mean a limitation on <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>’s full partnership with West, which is the single most important thing to maintain. Chancellor’s military advisers have told him any special security zone must extend from Atlantic to Urals.</p>
<p>(3) and (4) German Delegation had been instructed to regard reunification as secondary question and to put Berlin at top of list because of distrust of UK policy. If our rights in Berlin were surrendered or diminished, there would be even less prospect of reunification. Also, we should continue to base our position there on conquest.</p>
<p>(5) He has no enthusiasm about the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, but thinks some form of association might be acceptable if Western garrisons and guarantees remain and if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> exercises no command or executive functions.</p>
<p>(6) <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> believes we should not be deterred from going ahead with atomic stockpile agreements because of Soviet note or remonstrances. I told him of<hi rend="italic"></hi> my conversation with General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> on Friday and <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s suggestion that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> might answer the Soviet notes to US and <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>.<note n="8" xml:id="d273fn8"><persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> was in Paris April 23 and 24 en route to his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. According to his diary he discussed with <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> [text <hi rend="italic">not declassified</hi>] high altitude flights to Berlin. On the latter <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> agreed that they should not be continued until the Western Foreign Ministers had met. (Department of State, <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> Diaries: Lot 64 D 327)</note> Chancellor said he would like to consider this carefully but offhand believed reply from US much more important <pb xml:id="pg_647" n="647" facs="0672"/>than one from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. However, it might be that both methods should be used.</p>
<p>Since I was with Chancellor for four hours, obviously there was much additional conversation, but none I think worth reporting at this time, although I will speak to <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> in Paris about Chancellor’s confidence he can continue to dominate <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> foreign policy if he becomes President.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> had visited <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> Friday. They have been good friends for some years, and he feels assured of Italy’s backing for his present views. His evident liking for <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Segni</persName> has perhaps been strengthened by his having decisively beaten the Italian at his own national game of bowls in which <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> has become an expert. He has his own alley Rhoendorf and plays at night under arc lights. He said his relationship with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> was in every respect satisfactory.</p>
<p>One must not underestimate the depth of his settled suspicion of UK policy. It is affecting all his decisions and tactics. He regards <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s trip to Moscow as the beginning of a decided veering away on the part of the UK from what should be the true objectives of Western Alliance.</p>
<p>Chancellor seemed in perfect health, except for intermittent cough. He receives many visitors and expects to have a group of his leading party politicians at Cadenabbia this week to discuss his candidacy for the Presidency and his successor as Chancellor.</p>

<p>This telegram gives highlights of meeting. Full report follows.<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2"><gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 3106 from Paris, April 28. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/4–2859)</note> Discussion centered on sections Working Group Report dealing with German reunification and security with some discussion peace treaty section. Virtually nothing said ref Berlin and tactics sections.</p>
<p>Main development discussion security section was German statement under instructions that his government has reservations concerning zone of inspection. It should not be limited by political borders in order not to discriminate against Germany. Also, inspection and control would prohibit arms production in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and would give Soviets control of important segments of German industry. Furthermore Soviets could use inspection as device for spying on German industry and through it on Allied industry associated with the Germans in various European organizations. German <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss> said his <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> would make this point in Foreign Ministers Meetings.<note n="3" xml:id="d275fn3">See <ref target="#d280">Documents 280</ref>–<ref target="#d282">282</ref>.</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> commented it had always been clear West rejects zone of inspection limited to Germany alone but other aspects presented by German statement seemed new. Norway pointed out security arrangements only applied if Germany reunified. UK thought zones under consideration are those proposed earlier and included more territory than just Germany. He understood German concern related only to a small area. Thought it important to realize that, given Soviet attitude toward inspection as demonstrated most recently at Geneva,<note n="4" xml:id="d275fn4">Documentation on the nuclear testing talks at Geneva which began on January 20, 1959, is scheduled for publication in volume III.</note> any inspection which included Eastern Zone would not be too strict.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Plain from remarks members other delegations both during and after meeting this German statement caused considerable concern and not clear yet in its implications.</p>
<p>Remainder of discussion security and disarmament sections revealed familiar Scandinavian concern lest West be too hesitant in <pb xml:id="pg_650" n="650" facs="0675"/>undertaking (as distinct from merely proposing) practical measures of disarmament prior to agreement on entire package. Dutch statement (which they circulated)<note n="5" xml:id="d275fn5">A translation of the Dutch statement was transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> G–987 from Paris, April 29. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/4–2959)</note> voiced familiar worries about limiting size of area of limitation of forces and application of measures against surprise attack. Dutch also insisted there be no variations from or spell-out of agreed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> positions without <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> consultation.</p>
<p>Another principle subject discussion was meaning of phrase “indissoluble package”. Canadians and Scandinavians expressed concern lest it meant no part of package could be extracted at some stage if West might gain by so doing. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> voiced fear that since Soviets would never accept free elections there would be no discussion on security if plan really indissoluble. Consensus of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> finally was that plan as envisaged by Working Group indissoluble in sense that security measures and German reunification steps must proceed by stages together as outlined. Council understood Working Group envisaged necessity providing for possibility of discussion on Berlin alone. Recognized Western plan should be presented as solid package so as to discourage Russians from plucking specific parts out of it for negotiation. However, <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> and others stressed presentation should not preclude possibility dealing separately with European security during negotiations.</p>
<p>Under German reunification some discussion of mixed committee, with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> expressing fears lest this went too far in direct recognition East Germans. However, most members seemed to approve of this device for going part way to meet Russian position and adding novelty to traditional Western proposal.</p>
<p>Ref peace treaty <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> again voiced his doubts about wisdom of West tabling either treaty or principles and questioned why West should discuss peace treaty at all.</p>
<p>Only point brought up under Berlin and tactics sections was Italy’s request, apparently under instructions, that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> be given more information ref emergency planning for Berlin under conditions utmost secrecy such as meeting of <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PermRep</gloss>s only in <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s office. Also requested more precise information ref tactics.</p>
<p>Council plans to meet again afternoon April 29 for possible further discussion <gloss target="#t_WG1">WG</gloss> Report as well as other matters.<note n="6" xml:id="d275fn6">No record of any discussion of the report by the Council on April 29 has been found.</note> Plans also meeting afternoon May 1 or morning May 2 in hope there will be report from Ministers at that time.</p>

<p>3961. Approach of French Government officials to Berlin problem and East-West negotiations has been that of followers, not leaders. In general, French have tended adopt extremely conservative view on extent to which Western proposals in negotiations with Soviets should go beyond those advanced at Geneva 1955 Conference. This attitude has led French into positions paralleling those of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> on numerous issues, although sometimes for differing reasons.</p>
<p>Unlike situation in U.K., there are no strong public pressures on French Government to negotiate settlement with USSR. French opinion is primarily concerned with Algerian war and domestic political problem. Berlin crisis, while widely reported in press, does not seem to have greatly aroused average Frenchman. Also, there has been little public interest in proposals for disengagement. French officials themselves do not seem to be haunted by specter of catastrophic consequences of nuclear war. Conceivably because of their own lack of experience with and understanding of nuclear weapons, this factor does not appear to loom very large in their thinking. This apparent absence of great concern ref nuclear war is concurrent with, and possibly related to, French conviction that Soviets will not go to war if West is firm in resisting Soviet pressures. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> has made clear that he feels best way of dealing with Soviets is to demonstrate unmistakable firmness, and that to yield to Soviet blackmail invites disaster.</p>
<p>We suggest that following additional elements influence French attitudes concerning East-West talks: (1) basic scepticism ref Soviet willingness to negotiate seriously for relaxation tensions, (2) belief that recognition of status quo in Europe on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s terms will not result in stabilization of European political situation but will lend further impetus to Soviet drive to crack Western defenses, (3) fear that concessions to Soviets may have effect of affecting U.S. troop dispositions in Europe and lead eventually to withdrawal of our troops, (4) desire, particularly on <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s part, to work closely with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> in interests of Franco-German rapprochement.</p>
<p>Another, usually unvoiced, factor in French thinking is lack of enthusiasm in France for cause of German reunification. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, of course, contrary to views previously expressed privately, spoke <pb xml:id="pg_652" n="652" facs="0677"/>eloquently in March 25 press conference<note n="1" xml:id="d276fn1">For a transcript of this press conference, see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Statements</hi>, pp. 41–51.</note> of need for reunification, and some other far-seeing French officials appreciate dangers inherent in continued division. Nevertheless, it is probably safe to say that most Frenchmen would be content to leave situation as it is. In this, however, they would draw line short of recognizing <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>Embassy concludes, therefore, that, in forthcoming negotiations with Soviets, French will be firm, conservative, and hostile to concessions to Soviets. While this attitude is certainly to be welcomed, it is not unmitigated blessing. As already demonstrated in Working Group sessions, French may well be serious drag on efforts to present Western position in terms sufficiently reasonable to be appealing to public opinion.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s proposal for Summit agenda to include item on aid to undeveloped countries, and manner in which he has spoken on this subject in his recent speeches, represent attempt to raise sights on more idealistic plane. However, vagueness and impracticality this proposal make it doubtful that it will help counteract solid but essentially negative French stand in East-West negotiations.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 4. Secretary met with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> for thirty-five minutes afternoon April 28. Talk devoted virtually entirely to Germany.</p>
<p>Secretary opened stressing need for Allied unity and expressed hope next few days would see progress in this regard. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> indicated belief that since Soviets had created crisis and asked for negotiations, we should not rush forward with proposals but should await Soviet ideas.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_653" n="653" facs="0678"/>
<p>Secretary reiterated our position that Berlin not be discussed in isolation but rather as part of whole German problem. Therefore we should keep Berlin in that context.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> expressed doubt anything definitive could be decided now but agreed we should keep on trying. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> added he thought <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s principal objective in summit meeting was to divide West. He believed that the more precise were our proposals to Soviets, the greater success <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would have in attaining his objective since West would never agree on all details. He thought we should not be intimidated on German problem because U.S. remains strongest world power and accordingly there is little <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> can do under present conditions.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> then outlined his view that we should meet Soviets on some new ground and abandon present ground (i.e., Germany) which was terrain on which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> desired to operate. Accordingly we should meet Soviets on ground which would embarrass them, along lines of common plan for developing under-developed countries. Soviets could be invited participate in such scheme along with other civilized countries. He suggested plan for Africa in this context. U.S. which had long and successful experience in this field would of course play important role. In response to Secretary’s query, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> said his idea should be reserved for possible Summit meeting.</p>
<p>Secretary referred to May 11 conference and package which Working Group had put together. He had no illusions this package would be acceptable to Soviets but thought it had public appeal and responsibility for refusing it should be placed on Soviets.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> then asked if Secretary believed we should go to Summit Meeting if Foreign Ministers’ meeting produced nothing. Secretary replied in negative saying Foreign Ministers’ meeting should produce as minimum modus vivendi for Berlin which would last for some time.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> then referred to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> talks here<note n="1" xml:id="d277fn1">See <ref target="#d213">Document 213</ref>.</note> and in Washington<note n="2" xml:id="d277fn2">See <ref target="#d234">Documents 234</ref>–<ref target="#d241">241</ref>.</note> and said British Prime Minister appeared somewhat affected (marqué) by his trip to Moscow and determined to find ground for negotiations. He thought this was element to bear in mind re the future. Secretary agreed <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was somewhat more hopeful of having genuine negotiations with Soviets than we were. Also British believed we should jump to summit because only <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> appears able undertake meaningful discussions. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> expressed view that if we met <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> without some progress made by Foreign Ministers, and became engaged in a battle with him, result would be unfortunate.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_654" n="654" facs="0679"/>
<p>He thought Foreign Ministers’ meeting important. Secretary said President had similar ideas and thought Foreign Ministers’ meeting represented important probing operation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> added that French position on Germany already known. German settlement not currently possible in his view. German reunification might be achieved one day in future but this is not urgent matter for West, East or for Germany. In meantime we must hold firm. We should encourage practical contacts between two Germanies, not however to extent recognizing East Germany. Re German frontiers we must not change Oder-Neisse Line. Germany had lost war so it was normal she should pay certain price. Furthermore if we changed Oder-Neisse frontier, we should lose Poles, while finally there were few Germans in area anyway. France also believed there should be no special status for Germany as to armament limitations. Germany should have right belong to alliance of her choice.</p>
<p>Secretary referred to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s statement on German frontiers, and said he thought West Germans might be willing make statement on this subject but wanted something in exchange. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said in exchange they would get independence including freedom choose their alliances, what armaments they would have and later achieve unity.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> added we must not accept neutralization of Germany as this would weaken Atlantic Alliance. Secretary inquired if <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> meant this would weaken <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said it would weaken <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but also would have wider meaning of weakening whole Atlantic Alliance. Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> agreed negotiations would consume many months and that there was no hurry.</p>
<p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s inquiry on situation in East, Secretary indicated fear situation in Iraq moving towards communism, particularly in areas security and administrators. He expressed doubt Kassim<note n="3" xml:id="d277fn3">Prime Minister Abdel Karim al-Kassim of Iraq.</note> able reverse trend. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> expressed view Soviets might make move during Geneva Conference on Germany in some other area of world. He also stated he felt Soviets’ real interest not in Iraq but in Africa and present actions merely designed open corridor to that continent.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> noted Warsaw Pact Meeting and asked our view on meaning of invitation to Communist Chinese.<note n="4" xml:id="d277fn4">The Warsaw Pact Foreign Ministers met at Warsaw, April 27–28. Included in these meetings was the Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic of China.</note> Secretary gave view Soviets under pressure from Chinese Communists to include latter in international gatherings.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said if meetings enlarged he believed Italy should be included, presumably if Poland and Czechoslovakia included. He <pb xml:id="pg_655" n="655" facs="0680"/>favored maintenance four-power formula but said we should not forget Italy if others included. Secretary agreed saying U.S. position was that Italy should be added if anyone else were.</p>
<p>Secretary concluded saying we believe progress had been made in recent tripartite talks on Africa in Washington<note n="5" xml:id="d277fn5">U.S.-U.K.-French talks on Africa took place at Washington, April 16–21.</note> along lines which we believed General desired. He noted Working Groups set up to study specific projects, and believed this concept was advancing. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had no comment whatever on tripartite talks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> asked after President and expressed regret at illness former Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>German Attitude Towards Report of Working Group</item>
</list>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> began by saying he was grateful for the opportunity to see the Secretary privately. He had just had two days with Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> in Italy,<note n="1" xml:id="d278fn1"><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was at Cadenabbia on vacation.</note> who sent his greetings and indicated he was looking forward to seeing the Secretary as soon as possible. The Secretary indicated that he too hoped to see the Chancellor soon. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> stated that he could not emphasize how important it was that the Foreign Ministers agree on basic principles during their meetings in Paris. Any split would be highly dangerous for the Geneva Conference. He said that he did not know what the Secretary thought of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> letter to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s April 14 letter to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, see <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Riding the Storm</hi>, pp. 652–656.</note> but both he and the Chancellor regarded it as highly dangerous particularly since they had been given only a summary. They would like to know the contents of the other parts not included in the summary.</p>
<p>The Secretary noted that we had the same question in our minds. Up to now we had had no opportunity to discuss the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> communication with the British themselves.</p>
<p>With reference to the Working Group report,<note n="3" xml:id="d278fn3">See <ref target="#d271">Document 271</ref>.</note> Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said the Germans had had strong reservations against the intimations of measures against surprise attack in a limited area which the British had attempted to write into Stage II of the Phased Plan. Moreover, they were unable to accept the designation of countries by name in which special measures were to take place. In response to the Secretary’s query, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> indicated that the use of coordinates would be acceptable if the areas were designated as in the disarmament proposals of 1957.<note n="4" xml:id="d278fn4">Presumably <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> is referring to the proposals submitted to the subcommittee of the U.N. Disarmament Commission on August 2 and 29, 1957, which delimited by latitude and longitude an inspection zone in Europe. For texts of these proposals, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1945–1959</hi>, vol. II, pp. 837–839 and 868–874.</note></p>
<p>Moreover, he continued, any treatment of Germany which tended to make impossible Germany’s continuing participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would be unacceptable. The Secretary said that we were not prepared to countenance anything which would exclude Germany from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Our position was that security arrangements must be part of a complete package settlement. A unified Germany must have freedom of choice to join <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said he saw no difference in principle between us. He hoped that the German reservations to the security sections of the <pb xml:id="pg_657" n="657" facs="0682"/>London Working Group report would not be misunderstood or lead to fear and mistrust. He said that any revival of Four Power control would have undesirable psychological effects, intimating that the restrictions on production of <gloss target="#t_ABC1">ABC</gloss> weapons in Article 17 of the Phased Plan would have this result. The Federal Republic would be glad to guarantee that a unified Germany would voluntarily wish to perpetuate the renunciation of production of these weapons, but a system could not be tolerated which would let the Soviets into West German factories and lead to mass industrial espionage. The Federal Republic was willing to discuss production controls within the framework of general disarmament, and would not object to the inclusion of Germany within any generalized control system.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he was glad to have emphasized that the Foreign Ministers must reach an agreement during the Paris meetings. It would be highly undesirable to leave any loose ends hanging prior to Geneva. Whether it was considered practical or not, the Western Powers must keep their eyes on the goal of German unification. They must pull together on this basic point or the rationale of our entire position would collapse.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said he agreed and that the Western Powers would deceive themselves if they thought that the political problem of German participation could be put aside while other matters were dealt with.</p>
<p>The Secretary noted that the Germans appeared to have two major objections to the security aspects of the report: a) the singling out of Germany by name; b) any type of inspection system which involved the possibility of industrial espionage by the Soviets.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> said this was correct, but he would like to put the matter somewhat more generally. The Germans would accept any control system on a broader basis if other countries were involved. However, he believed the British ideas of special controls for the Rapacki area were psychologically and politically pernicious. He wished to say frankly that he most sincerely felt that any solution which would give the opposition in Germany a chance to discuss disengagement and the Rapacki Plan would be disastrous. Public opinion in Germany was now fairly sound but would be weakened by such proposals. Germany must remain part of the Western Alliance system; otherwise neutralization would grow. In this connection he referred to recent <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> reunification plans<note n="5" xml:id="d278fn5">See <ref target="#d254fn3">footnote 3, Document 254</ref>.</note> which, he commented, must be rejected in their entirety. Not only the question of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> membership was involved, but also Germany’s <pb xml:id="pg_658" n="658" facs="0683"/>role in the movement toward integration, for example, <gloss target="#t_EURATOM1">EURATOM</gloss> and the Common Market.</p>
<p>In concluding, the Secretary said that he could repeat without equivocation that the U.S. had no thought of suggesting any arrangement which would alienate Germany from her European connections. He thought that these basic concepts might not be understood in the same sense by the British, particularly the need to strengthen the movement towards European integration.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Western Position in Geneva Meetings</item>
</list>
<p>The Secretary met with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> this morning at 10 o’clock for half an hour prior to the first formal meeting of the Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>The Secretary indicated that he felt strongly that before the Foreign Ministers left Paris the various loose strings on matters which the Working Party had not been able to reach agreement should be disposed of and the four Allies should be in a solid position. The Secretary indicated <pb xml:id="pg_659" n="659" facs="0684"/>he felt that we all would be in a very bad position vis-à-vis the press and world opinion, if this were not the case. He said he hoped that the Foreign Minister would permit him to speak on this point at the opening when he intended to emphasize strongly the necessity for us to concentrate on the forest of our main objectives and not be confused by the trees of detail and disagreement.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Foreign Minister raised the matter of informing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> next week and the Secretary explained that as he had so recently taken office he felt he would have to return to Washington next week where he had work to do and he hoped that Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> would undertake the task of informing the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council on behalf of the others of the results of this Paris meeting.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Presence of Secretaries-General of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> at Geneva</p>
<p>The question of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> being at Geneva was discussed and Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that the French agreed that he should be present to receive the Delegates and make an opening speech “but not on substance.”</p>
<p>The Secretary raised Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s suggestion of leaving at Geneva after his own departure an assistant to be available throughout the Conference.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Minister had reservations on this point since he felt that if this was agreed to before the Conference it would give the appearance of committing us to some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> participation in the solution.</p>
<p>The Secretary indicated that this was a point on which the United States did not feel as strongly as the French. Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> laughingly remarked that this was a point on which the French were perhaps more in agreement with the Soviets.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had discussed in the United States the possibility of his being at Geneva.<note n="1" xml:id="d279fn1">A brief summary of <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s conversation with the President, <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> on April 24, during which he suggested, and the President and Secretary of State approved, the idea of <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> being present at Geneva in an informal capacity, was transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Topol1">Topol</gloss> 3548 to Paris, April 24. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 396.1–GE/4–2359)</note></p>
<p>On this point also, the French Foreign Minister had reservations, saying “everyone seems to want to be at Geneva.”</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Representation at Geneva</p>
<p>The Secretary inquired whether the French proposed having military men in their Delegation. The question arose with us as to whether the Secretary of Defense should be a member of our Delegation. The Secretary indicated that in his opinion there might be some psychological <pb xml:id="pg_660" n="660" facs="0685"/>advantage in the Secretary of Defense being a delegate as it would indicate that we were in earnest.</p>
<p>Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that the French would have with them a French colonel who had participated in the Working Group, but that he would act not as a member of the Delegation but rather in the capacity of an adviser.</p>
<p>The matter of military participation at the Summit Meeting was also raised and it was pointed out that in 1955 at Geneva Marshal Zhukov had been present.</p>
<p>Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_JL1">Joxe</persName> pointed out, however, that the Marshal was there not so much as a member of the Delegation as a former companion in arms of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, a card which the Russians were then playing but which had not worked out successfully.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">German Position</p>
<p>In reply to the Foreign Minister’s inquiry as to the German position, the Secretary explained that he had seen <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> this morning<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">See <ref target="#d278">Document 278</ref>.</note> and that the Germans appeared to be prepared to go along on everything except the Security Zone. They considered that any security zone should cover areas rather than countries. Also, they were against permitting any inspection in Germany since they felt that this would a) permit the Soviets to carry on espionage, and b) they were not prepared to grant the Soviets the right to monitor nuclear matters, which they have given us.</p>
<p>The Germans were willing to press forward on the matter of unification in the three proposed phases.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Security and Disarmament</p>
<p>Monsieur <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said the whole matter of security and disarmament was very difficult and he wondered if a slightly different presentation would not be preferable, separating unification, security and disarmament. By this he meant something less precise on the matter of disarmament, but linked in the field of control with the matter of general European disarmament. The Foreign Minister said they favored this approach so as not to put the Germans in too difficult a position vis-à-vis Soviet control.</p>
<p>The Secretary indicated that we would be quite prepared to discuss these French views with them and suggested that the experts work out details on this matter. However, he emphasized our belief that the whole package concept was essential.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister explained that the setting forth of exact numerical limitation of forces presented difficulty for France because of <pb xml:id="pg_661" n="661" facs="0686"/>Algeria. He also felt that no mention of nuclear disarmament from the general disarmament point of view was not good. He felt, moreover, that, at this juncture, the Soviets were sufficiently strong in nuclear weapons to be disturbing.</p>
<p>The Secretary indicated that for the present he believed we were stronger. The Secretary reiterated our belief that the package solution was attractive to the world, but if we diluted it it might be whittled away as were our 1955 proposals.</p>
<p>Both the Secretary and the Foreign Minister agreed that our present proposals were more attractive than those of 1955.</p>
<p>Some discussion ensued about participation of Poland and Czechoslovakia and it was agreed that our policy should be to resist the seating of Poland and Czechoslovakia as long as possible, but that if this proved impossible we were in accord that Italy should participate.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister said he foresaw a difficulty as he believed that the Soviets were determined to seat the East German, <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName>, at the Council table.</p>
<p>There was discussion of the possibility of Rumanian, Dutch, or Yugoslav participation, and both the Secretary and the Foreign Minister agreed that every attempt should be made to limit the participation, particularly as a precedent for Geneva since a four-nation meeting might be manageable, but a 20-nation would be impossible.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister asked whether the inclusion of a German representative at the Foreign Ministers meeting constituted a precedent for the Summit.</p>
<p>The Secretary said this was a matter which would have to be worked out at the Foreign Ministers meeting.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 12. Department pass Defense. Western Foreign Ministers’ Meeting: April 29—morning session.</p>
<p>1. After <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s welcoming statement, Secretary stressed need for resolving swiftly the many questions of substance left unsettled by <pb xml:id="pg_662" n="662" facs="0687"/>Working Group. Must develop effective Western position and not go to Geneva on Soviet terms with discussion limited to Berlin crisis which USSR precipitated. Western package must be attractive enough to arouse support throughout world, must be indissoluble and should contain proposals for an improved position for Berlin. Work must be conducted in realization that despite more conciliatory tone of recent Soviet pronouncements we are facing issues involving danger of war. Particularly distressing that newspaper speculations have created impression Western disunity. Vital to prevent spread of such impressions.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> suggested Foreign Ministers agree to inform press their discussions confidential and to give no briefings until end of meeting. Generally agreed to give no information to press today and if possible withhold information until end of meetings.</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> then began review of phased plan.<note n="1" xml:id="d280fn1">The Report of the Four-Power Working Group included a four-phase peace plan (see <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>). For text of the phased plan as presented by the Western powers at the Foreign Ministers Conference on May 14, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 624–629, or <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 55–60.</note> After US, French and British all pointed out that present composition of all-German Committee under paragraph 7 too heavily weighted against East Germans to seem appealing to public opinion, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> agreed to accept French suggestion to raise composition to 25 for the Federal Republic and 10 for <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> with three-fourths majority required. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> pointed out this increase in size also decreased the resemblance of committee to a cabinet thus minimizing danger of committee appearing in role of executive body. Agreed to delete last sentence of paragraph 7<note n="2" xml:id="d280fn2">The last sentence of paragraph 7 reads: “They would not exercise any other public function during the period of their membership.”</note> on ground this unnecessary limitation on selection of candidates. Words “representatives of” changed to “members from” at suggestion <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>. Also agreed to refer to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as so-called German Democratic Republic in order to simplify paragraph.</p>
<p>4. Bracketed section of paragraph 10 referred to Working Group for redrafting with directive that language should be altered to eliminate any implication all-German Committee might give directives to governments or stand above the Government of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> suggested as possible formula that proposals of committee could be implemented through respective legislative procedures applicable in each part of Germany. Considered this would be consistent with requirements of German basic law. Although <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> preferred to delete sentence did not object to referring problem to legal advisers.</p>
<p>5. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> then suggested Working Group review reunification section of stage III to Polish language. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> suggested <pb xml:id="pg_663" n="663" facs="0688"/>paragraph 24 be carefully examined to eliminate any possibility USSR might utilize it as pretext for extending its influence into <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>, for example by stationing Soviet troops in West Germany. Secretary suggested problem might be met by providing that each of four powers would exercise reserved rights within its respective zone of responsibility. Agreed to refer reunification sections of phased plan to Working Group session in afternoon.</p>
<p>6. Foreign Ministers then turned to security sections phased plan. Agreed each would present general views on security measures before engaging in detailed review of phased plan by paragraph.</p>
<p>7. Germans opened by translating statement which they promised to table in English at afternoon session.<note n="3" xml:id="d280fn3">No copy of this statement has been found.</note> This statement represented considered position of German Government and had been discussed with Chancellor. Although Federal Government agreed with general principle of establishment of security zones against surprise attack mentioned in paragraph 16 could not accept a more limited zone restricted to Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and possibly Hungary. Such an arrangement would have profound military, political and psychological disadvantages. It would place Germany in special status in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Such special inspection system would probably entail withdrawal from German area of key types of defense installations. It would amount to discrimination against Germany. However, any inspection systems involving wide geographic areas would be acceptable. This especially pertinent in case of ground inspection. Suggested adopting Geneva formula regarding areas of comparable size, depth and importance on both sides of line of demarcation between reunited Germany and Eastern European countries.<note n="4" xml:id="d280fn4">Reference here and in the next sentence is to the proposals referred to in <ref target="#d278fn4">footnote 4, Document 278</ref>.</note> Also referred to 1957 proposals for inspection against surprise attack extending to 60 degrees east, or at any rate zone extending far into Soviet territory. Any zones for aerial and ground inspections should be identical.</p>
<p>8. German statement also took exception to paragraph 17. It was not possible to subject all-German Government in advance to prohibitions on production <gloss target="#t_ABC1">ABC</gloss> weapons. Prohibition very different from prohibition contained in <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> Protocols which had been voluntarily accepted by Federal Government. Language paragraph 17 would result in large scale Soviet inspection of German industry and would be intolerable. Germans suggested paragraph 17 be rewritten to effect that all-German Government be invited to extend renunciation on <gloss target="#t_ABC1">ABC</gloss> manufacture accepted by <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> to all-Germany insofar as comparable <pb xml:id="pg_664" n="664" facs="0689"/>waivers accepted by Soviet Bloc countries. Such arrangements thinkable only on basis of reciprocity and would require similar controls in USSR. This provision should be transferred to stage III since consent of an all-German Government would be required.</p>
<p>9. Germans also opposed to accepting commitment not to station <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s in security zone area. Such a commitment could have farreaching consequences for Western defense planning and West should not tie its hands in advance on this matter. Therefore wished to see paragraph 18 deleted. German paper closed with reiteration opposition to any discriminatory provisions applied to Germany which would reduce her to special status in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and impair her development of close ties with West. <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> could not accept any provisions which would worsen its legal position.</p>
<p>10. In further clarification of German position on security, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> pointed out that the Germans differentiated between two types of zones mentioned in the phased plan. Surprise attack zones should be defined by geographic coordinates, cover as wide an area as possible, and provide for identical coverage by aerial and ground inspection.</p>
<p>Stage II zone of inspection (paragraph 16) is unwise in German view because Soviets would have opportunity to spy on German industry. The Germans, of course, have no objection to the present <gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss> system of inspection and would be prepared to have this extended to an all-German Government when established.</p>
<p>11. Pointing out that these German reservations applied to stage II, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked as to German attitude toward paragraph 27 in stage III. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> replied that while the Germans have no objection in principle to force ceilings, they are opposed to definition of area of their application in “Rapacki Plan” terms. In response to <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> confirmed that formula used in paragraph 3 of the Geneva 1955 Treaty of Assurance<note n="5" xml:id="d280fn5">For text of MFM/DOC/7, October 27, 1955, which included an “Outline of Terms of Treaty of Assurance on the Reunification of Germany,” see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1945–1959</hi>, vol. I, pp. 529–532.</note> (areas of comparable size, depth, and importance) would be acceptable.</p>
<p>12. With regard to paragraph 16, there seemed to be general agreement with the Secretary’s view that since ground inspection would be difficult in Arctic zone, the provision for identical coverage for aerial and ground inspection should apply primarily to a European zone. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> pointed out that it was important to include non-European inspection zones, since without some provision for inspection of U.S. territory, the Soviets could logically argue that the Western proposals were <pb xml:id="pg_665" n="665" facs="0690"/>designed to open up Soviet territory without any adequate compensation.</p>
<p>13. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> favored paragraph 17 (<gloss target="#t_ABC1">ABC</gloss> weapons) as means of exploiting weakness inherent in the Soviet Bloc’s position. Soviets, unlike West, have not prohibited manufacture of <gloss target="#t_ABC1">ABC</gloss> weapons in the Soviet Bloc territory, and there would be considerable advantage in mentioning this as soon as possible in phased plan, preferably in stage II. In <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s view, this should be more that a mere reaffirmation of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>’s commitment. In order to meet German objection to area definition in “Rapacki Plan” terms, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> suggested that <gloss target="#t_ABC1">ABC</gloss> prohibition be extended only to so-called <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said he was in basic agreement with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s ideas and, while he would prefer area definitions along lines of Geneva 1955 formula, he believed the problem was one of language rather than one of substance.</p>
<p>14. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> pointed out that if German recommendations accepted, only security provision left in stage II would be paragraph 13 (exchange of information). Even if, as <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> pointed out, first sentence in paragraph 16 were retained and paragraph 17 were revised to meet German objections, stage II would remain largely devoid of significant security provisions and public appeal aspects of package would be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>15. In explaining French position on security and general disarmament provisions of phased plan, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> pointed out that French objections were principally following: (1) French could not agree to force ceiling of 750,000 since they now exceed this level in order to meet Algerian commitments; (2) French oppose formulation of general disarmament proposals which do not mention atomic weapons. French are not convinced in any case of desirability of introducing general disarmament measures into “phased plan” and would be prepared to delete all reference to general disarmament if others agree.</p>
<p>16. The Secretary said that while he felt that elimination of specific force ceilings from general disarmament provisions would considerably reduce their popular appeal, he could understand French problem. Asked if French would be prepared to accept a ceiling of 1,000,000, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> replied that while the French could live with this ceiling, it could scarcely be interpreted as a general disarmament measure since it represented a considerable increase over the publicly known 1957 ceilings. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested that since British forces are now below 1957 ceiling, it might be feasible to impose a combined ceiling of 1,500,000 on British and French forces. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> doubted public acceptability of this formula and suggested instead that four powers be required to announce number of men each now has under arms and to declare their intention not to increase these levels. The Secretary cited disadvantage this formula in view of continuing German build-up and suggested that the problem <pb xml:id="pg_666" n="666" facs="0691"/>might best be met by use of general language which would not impose an intolerable ceiling on the French and, at the same time, meet desirable objective of introducing limitations on the Soviets; for example “the four powers would restrict or reduce their armed forces to maximum limits to be agreed, which, for example, for the United States and USSR might be 2,500,000 each”. Similar general language could be substituted for the appropriate paragraphs in stages II and III. The Secretary’s formula was accepted in principle.</p>
<p>17. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> wondered if some mention might not be made in the general disarmament provisions of nuclear weapons. The Secretary replied that while United States experts had given much thought to the problem, they had been unable to come up with a satisfactory and adequate formula in view of the great multiplicity of modern nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>18. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> withdrew British reservation to paragraph 4 and, while favoring retention of paragraph 5, agreed it might be unwise to make a permanent commitment not to station <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s in Germany (paragraph 18). In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> pointed out that retention of paragraph 18 might conceivably induce other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries to cancel their commitments to permit <gloss target="#t_IRBM1">IRBM</gloss>’s to be stationed on their territories, since in some cases these commitments had been made specifically contingent on acceptance by other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 13. Department pass Defense. Western Foreign Ministers Meeting—afternoon session April 29.</p>
<p>1. First subject for discussion was section of Working Group Report on draft principles of German peace settlement. Re paragraph II of this section, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> did not favor deletion whole paragraph. He preferred principle set forth in US proposal (Proposal A) but had some difficulties with wording. It was agreed that paragraph II <pb xml:id="pg_667" n="667" facs="0692"/>would be based on US proposal, but that legal experts would consider revised wording to make acceptable to <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. (See <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 10)<note n="1" xml:id="d281fn1"><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 10, April 29, transmitted the text agreed by the legal advisers on the bracketed sections of the principles of a German peace settlement. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note></p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> questioned reference to “self-determination” in paragraph III and wondered what it meant. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said it was intended to emphasize right of all-German state to choose its own internal system and its external relations; also, it would guard against Soviet desire to intervene in event social structures in East Germany are changed. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed, but went on to say that French objected to all of paragraph IV after word “settlement”. It was agreed to drop language after “settlement”, and to reverse order of present paragraphs III and IV. Legal experts would check language of both paragraphs in view of revised order.</p>
<p>3. It was agreed to drop second sentence of paragraph VIII re prohibition on Anschluss, and to add Austrian State Treaty at end of first sentence this paragraph.</p>
<p>4. French questioned necessity of including paragraph X re agreements <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and “<gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>”, saying that it was obvious reunified Germany would be new state and that all agreements of both parts of Germany should be reviewed. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said question was practical one and that it would be desirable to keep as many agreements on both parts of Germany as possible. Obviously, it would be most difficult to renegotiate all agreements made by both Germanies. He confirmed <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>’s support of proposal A under paragraph X. It was finally agreed that this whole paragraph pertained to question of law and that it would be referred to legal experts for further review and recommendation.</p>
<p>5. Discussion then turned to section of Working Group Report on Berlin. First question was what, if anything, should go into overall, phased plan concerning Berlin. Secretary stated US believed phased plan should contain positive proposal on Berlin. Of two alternatives proposals under paragraph II of Working Group Report, US favored first alternative, since this proposed something which went beyond status quo. Secretary noted Soviets brought about present crisis, although we had been fairly satisfied with existing situation in Berlin. If we now say nothing and in effect accept status quo, we will really be going backwards. We should take step forward and make Soviets go on defensive.</p>
<p>6. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> agreed with Secretary’s point and said it was important for presentational reasons that phased plan should have proposal in it concerning Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed, although he said French have reserves concerning points in first alternative re plebiscite on foreign troops and removal of <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> capital from East Berlin (sub-paragraphs (II) and (III) <pb xml:id="pg_668" n="668" facs="0693"/>under alternative A in recommendations portion of Working Group paper on Berlin). <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> thought proposal for plebiscite weakened our position, since it seemed to indicate we were not sure of Berlin opinion regarding troops; also, it weakened our legal position. On paragraph (III), he thought it might be going too far to suggest removal of <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> capital.</p>
<p>8. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said he shared <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s objections on these two points. He thought it would be better to delete (II) and (III). Secretary said that, if Foreign Ministers agreed to accept alternative A for inclusion in phased plan, then (II) and (III) could be dropped. This suggestion was adopted and Working Group will prepare new language. Foreign Ministers agreed that proposal along these lines for Berlin solution would be included in stage I of phased plan. Elections in whole of Berlin might take place in stage II.</p>
<p>9. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested that alternative B (status quo proposal) for Berlin solution might be used as fallback position on Berlin in discussion with Soviets of overall phased plan. Alternative B would not be included in plan at outset, but could be brought out in discussion. Secretary thought this would be feasible if Soviets agree to discuss Berlin in context of phased plan.</p>
<p>10. Foreign Ministers then discussed interim Berlin solution in isolation, if Soviets reject phased plan. Secretary emphasized dangers of having public receive impression through leaks that <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s had agreed on fallback solution for Berlin separate from overall, phased plan. He thought, therefore, that it might be better for <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s to reserve discussion of interim solution for Geneva in light of situation as it develops there. In meantime, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s would have problem in mind and there could be direct contact between <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s. Secretary felt group was agreed on major part of proposed solution and that further discussion at this time would be unwise.</p>
<p>11. Other <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s concurred with Secretary’s views and it was agreed that discussion of fallback plan for Berlin in isolation would be removed from Western paper. However, it was agreed that initial Western proposal outside of package framework would be Western proposal contained in phased plan.</p>
<p>12. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> opened discussion tactics section by asking what sort of meeting envisaged. Would it consist of plenary sessions every day with large delegations and much publicity, or would there be sufficient intervals between plenaries for private meetings, say Foreign Ministers with one advisor each, where real negotiations could take place. Thought latter arrangement by far the better and believed Soviets would adhere to such arrangements if they so agreed. Noted this point covered by paragraph 9 Working Group paper on tactics.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_669" n="669" facs="0694"/>
<p>13. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed small meetings better, but this was difficult question to determine in advance. Past history showed large meetings with much publicity accomplished little whereas private meetings had shown some results as in 1954.<note n="2" xml:id="d281fn2">Presumably <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> is referring to the Geneva Conference on Indochina, May 8–July 21, 1954; for documentation, see <ref target="frus1952-54v16"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, volume XVI</ref>.</note> Soviets would want to make a show with their proposals to impress world, and this will probably take several days, not to mention ironing out question of participation Czechs and Poles and status of Germans at conference.</p>
<p>14. Secretary wondered if West could control problem but agreed small meeting best. There were indications Soviets will wish discuss peace treaty proposals paragraph by paragraph for effect on East Germans. There is also the question whether or not West should table proposals at outset. Furthermore, should we publish proposals beforehand in full or in summary and if so, how long before Geneva meeting opens. The question of public posture was tied in with report of Ministerial Meetings to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
<p>15. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> thought proposals should not be published in advance. West should keep something for the conference. Soviets would publicize their proposals. We should keep our proposals as answers and counter-proposals to Soviets. Also wondered about security in connection with report to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
<p>16. Secretary replied that West had insisted Berlin be considered in context of German problem as a whole. If West tables plan, it takes initiative and puts burden on Soviets to reject. US position on this point not frozen but believe it important.</p>
<p>17. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> did not see advantages of prior announcement. If there is prior announcement of Western position, loyal opposition in UK would immediately start picking holes in it, thereby helping Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> agreed with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> since there was same difficulty with opposition in Germany. Suggested, however, summary of Western proposals be published when they are tabled. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> added that he thought nothing should be published until Geneva meeting got down to business which would probably not happen until after initial period of procedural wrangling. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> noted that something might of course happen between now and May 11 to cause change in thinking and suggested summary be prepared. To Secretary’s remark that plan would probably come up bit by bit anyhow, French replied this would not be same as formal announcement of entire plan. Secretary then said US willing to agree with others on this point in view internal political difficulties in UK and Germany.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_670" n="670" facs="0695"/>
<p>18. It was agreed that <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> should be given an oral report by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, as chairman, at end Ministerial talks.</p>
<p>19. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then suggested Ministers should run over questions posed by Working Group in first part of their report under paragraph 3 “tactics”. It was agreed (a), (b), (d) have been covered and that the summary mentioned in (c) should be prepared. Concerning (e), <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> thought principles could be discussed since they would have been stated. Furthermore, we had told Soviets in our notes we would consider Soviet proposals. Secretary remarked that if we begin by discussing principles, we’ll never get beyond first one.</p>
<p>20. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> thought it better not to try obtain agreement on formal agenda and should avoid wrangle on procedure. Should insist on discussion of our principles if Soviets wanted to table their treaty. Concluded by saying, “if they want to talk about a treaty, we should let them have it”. The others agreed.</p>
<p>21. On participation of Czechs and Poles, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> summed up present agreement that West preferred to confine talks to four powers. Would try to avoid admission Czechs and Poles, but if they had to agree, would insist on participation of Italy. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested that Soviets might not be averse to excluding Czechs and Poles but would wish find way to save face. Why not then propose at outset of conference that question of participation be postponed, perhaps for week?</p>
<p>22. On German participation, after Secretary had quoted agreed formula in Western notes<note n="3" xml:id="d281fn3">See <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note> which Soviets apparently had accepted, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> wondered if soundings might be taken as to Soviet attitude by having Western delegation secretaries at their meeting next week casually raise problem of seating for Germans. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> said that while he would plan to be present in Geneva, he would not attend meetings. <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> advisors would be led by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> and would not expect to sit at table with Western delegations. It would not matter to him whether <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> (East German Foreign Minister) chose to attend conference.</p>
<p>23. Ministers then recapitulated program of work of sub-groups as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) Working Group would finish redrafting reunification, security and Berlin sections.</item>
<item>(2) Legal advisors would work on peace treaty section and coordinate with Working Group.</item>
<item>(3) There should be amendment to tactics section of Working Group report to take into account preceding discussion.</item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_671" n="671" facs="0696"/>
<p>24. Meeting ended with short discussion of how to handle press questions, with UK stressing need to give no indication Berlin fall-back positions left for later discussion at Geneva. Next meeting scheduled for 10:30 a.m. April 30 to review reports of Working Group and legal experts.</p>

<p>Following is summary of action taken and highlights of discussion:</p>
<p>1. Adopted Working Group redrafts of certain paras of phased plan<note n="4" xml:id="d282fn4">For text of the phased plan as agreed by the Foreign Ministers and presented to the Foreign Ministers Conference on May 14, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pages 624–629, or <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 55–60.</note> in accordance with instructions from Foreign Ministers resulting from yesterday’s meetings.

<item>areas throughout the world as may be agreed by the four powers and other states concerned”. Latter was suggested by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> who said would have to disagree if language were to be limited to 1957 disarmament proposals.</item>
<item>(B) In discussion of para 25, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> opposed reference to line of demarcation between reunified Germany and <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> countries in determining area of foreign forces balance on ground this subject to 1955 criticism that it assumed German membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. To meet this problem as well as eliminate possibility of continued stationing of Soviet forces in Germany after reunification and before entry into force of peace treaty, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> indicated willingness to drop any reference to limitations on foreign forces prior to peace treaty. The Secretary suggested formula providing that after peace treaty no foreign forces would be stationed in zone without consent of host country and that after states had expressed desires in this respect, there could be discussions on limitations of foreign forces on both sides of line of demarcation between reunified Germany and <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss>.

<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>“In yesterday’s meetings with the Foreign Ministers,<note n="1" xml:id="d283fn1">See <ref target="#d282fn7">Document 282 and footnote 7</ref> thereto.</note> we completed work on text of phased plan as well as reaching agreement on tactics to be used in the opening stages of the Geneva meeting. Such difficulties as existed were resolved in an atmosphere of determination to maintain unity and in the best of spirits. I will bring you the documents which are quite lengthy at Gettysburg tomorrow. While gratified over the results, I feel some basic difficulties with British were swept under the rug and are likely to reappear at Geneva. However, these are unlikely to be referred to any way publicly before Geneva unless the British themselves have political reasons to make some unfortunate statement. I am seeing <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> this afternoon<note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2">See vol. VII, Part 2, <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> and returning tonight.</p>

<p>2204. I believe Soviets will make strong effort at Geneva <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> meeting to insure that Summit meeting takes place. Possibility exists they will endeavor to demonstrate reasonableness by reaching agreement on some specific subject. Most likely items would appear to be either Berlin question or atomic testing prohibition. Alternative approach might be to present some far-reaching scheme which would be full of bugs from our point of view such as withdrawal American troops from Europe but which would contain sufficient attractive provisions that we could scarcely refuse to discuss them at Summit. Suggest that at meeting Western <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>’s immediately prior conference might be useful to reach agreement that Ministers would refrain from any substantive comment on surprise Soviet proposals until Western Ministers have opportunity to study implications and coordinate their attitude.</p>
<p>While <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s indication to Montgomery<note n="1" xml:id="d285fn1">Field Marshal Montgomery visited the Soviet Union April 28–30 and discussed the Berlin situation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>; see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, May 10, 1959, pp. 1 and 37.</note> of his willingness forego separate peace treaty may have been merely effort split British from other Western powers, I suspect Soviets have had second thoughts about advisability separate treaty. Now seems less likely than before that they could obtain signature non-bloc countries such as India and Egypt. Moreover their position that following separate peace treaty with East Germany Western rights in Berlin would be extinguished could place them in difficult situation where any incident stirred up by East Germans could face them with demands to implement their Warsaw Pact commitment.</p>

Chancellor made no reference to substance Western proposals forthcoming Geneva Conference but stressed repeatedly his concern at general British attitude and conception of way in which negotiations with Russians should be handled. French Foreign Minister said that conference had been very well, “perhaps too well”, prepared by Working Group. However fact <pb xml:id="pg_677" n="677" facs="0702"/>should be faced that there fundamental differences between British approach on one hand and French and German approach on the other. These differences consisted, first in British belief that persistent negotiation might entice Russians into acceptable agreement on conditions for European political settlement. Accordingly, British prepared offer concessions and compromises even in absence substantial evidence from Soviets they prepared negotiate realistically. Termed this state of mind dangerous for security of West which, on contrary, should be extremely firm at start and only make concessions in return for significant concessions by the other side. Second major reason for concern was British proposal for inspection zone in Central Europe. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that although British had last week agreed not to press this proposal for time being, he was not reassured [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> suggested that United States would probably have to play decisive role in maintenance Western unity.

Following the meeting <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> flew to Geneva.</note></p>
<p>Chancellor expressed his gratitude for opportunity give Secretary his views before Geneva Conference and, speaking from hand-written notes, held forth for over one hour on following topics:</p>
<p>1. Assurance that should there be changes in high offices this summer in Federal Republic, German foreign policy would remain unaltered.</p>
<p>2. Extensive review and analysis Soviet policy, objectives and methods which German particularly qualified to understand. Chancellor produced statistics on treaties and agreements violated by Soviet Union. He recalled his conversations with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and Bulganin in 1955,<note n="2" xml:id="d288fn2">For documentation on <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s visit to the Soviet Union in September 1955, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, vol. V</ref>, pp. 573 ff.</note> and went into great detail on significance Soviet seven year plan, and problems inherent in Soviet relations with Communist China as expressed by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and confirmed to him last year by <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> in Bonn.<note n="3" xml:id="d288fn3"><persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> visited Bonn April 23–26, 1958.</note> Said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wants consolidate gains in Europe without war, and proceed with attempt catch up with economy United States, in hope that by eventually adding industrial resources Western Europe to those Soviet Union he would achieve decisive advantage over United States and win cold war. This why Soviet Union wants relaxation tensions.</p>
<p>With regard Germany, Soviet Union aims incorporate Federal Republic economy into its own. Political road to this would consist of <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> victory at 1961 elections, or via confederation two Germanies, which would constitute substantial move this direction.</p>
<p>3. Chancellor discussed Geneva and commented ironically on working group’s exhaustive “even staggering” preparations. Said <pb xml:id="pg_679" n="679" facs="0704"/>Berlin most immediate and urgent question. Stressed necessity of “untying package” proposals at right time, lest issue Berlin be somehow left behind and lost in mass proposals and counterproposals other issues. Warned against danger creation new legal basis Western rights on access which would involve destruction existing rights derived from occupation. Latter obligate Soviet Union bring about reunification Germany, and this obligation would be eliminated if fundamental basis present rights destroyed. Expressed strong gratitude United States reaffirmation necessity German reunification in freedom in recent public address by Secretary.<note n="4" xml:id="d288fn4">See <ref target="#d286">Document 286</ref>.</note> Federal Republic prepared increase technical contacts with so-called <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, but most important achieve free movement persons between two Germanies, and end to current persecution 15 million Protestants and 2 million Catholics East zone. Reunification Germany can be achieved only via free elections and not by mingling Communist and non-Communist regimes. Federal Government would consider any proposal latter course action completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>4. Mentioned recent talks with French<note n="5" xml:id="d288fn5">See <ref target="#d287">Document 287</ref>.</note> only briefly because “had reached complete agreement on all points”.</p>
<p>5. Dwelt at length on his concern with regard British attitude connected with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> ten-day visit Moscow. “Basic change British policy” not due solely to worry about Labour Party and elections. Stressed necessity for European unity including United Kingdom for its own sake and that of rest of Europe.</p>
<p>6. Polish boundary question must be settled by peace treaty and not by “unilateral occupation”. Right of human beings recognized by United Nations Declaration Human Rights to live in their own homes must be respected. Federal Republic wishes strive for reduction and removal tensions with Poland, and development mutually beneficial economic relations. This important because Poland eastern-most country whose civilization and culture Western origin.</p>
<p>7. Chancellor turned to European security which he termed “empty concept and empty word”, since security can only be global. Traditional Soviet pressure toward Mediterranean endangers Turkey, Greece, Italy and constitutes southern jaw of pincer movement combined with pressure on Germany in north, seeking pick off all of Europe. Concept European security outmoded because of modern weapons. Chancellor attacked concept narrow security zone in central Europe not so much because discriminating against Germany but because involving inspection Germany industry by Soviets which unacceptable German people. Federal Government could never accept such scheme, <pb xml:id="pg_680" n="680" facs="0705"/>which aided by <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> victory, should this happen in 1961, liable wreck <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Chancellor asked we not forget merits general controlled disarmament which only real framework security and to which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> possibly receptive because he concerned with promotion his economic program requiring reduction armament expenditures.</p>
<p>In reply, Secretary stressed hope maintain same close relations with Chancellor as formerly the case with <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. Proposed we exchange data on Soviet treaty violations (Chancellor handed over his report to <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>).<note n="6" xml:id="d288fn6">Not found.</note> Said we very conscious Soviet economic growth and informed Chancellor certain points discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName><note n="7" xml:id="d288fn7">Documentation on <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s discussions in the United States in January on economic matters is in volume X, Part 1.</note> which revealed latter’s inability reconcile statistics Soviet agricultural labor requirements and productivity with high hopes of Soviet Government in economic field.</p>
<p>Secretary discussed British Trade Mission Moscow and credit terms to Soviets envisaged by United Kingdom Government.<note n="8" xml:id="d288fn8">It was announced in April that a British Trade Mission headed by Sir David Eccles, President of the Board of Trade, would visit the Soviet Union. Eccles arrived in Moscow on May 13 and a 5-year trade agreement was signed on May 24.</note> He said we had made strong representations to British on this point. <persName corresp="#p_SAHV1">Van Scherpenberg</persName> here stated he had that same morning called in British Ambassador and has expressed strong German reservations. Secretary said it seemed French had not done so, and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> appeared [take] note of this.</p>
<p>With regard to package proposals and Berlin, Secretary said we had no desire undermine present legal basis our rights. Possibly some additional elements might be superimposed, but on no account substituted for present basis our rights, which must not be impaired. We believe British now convinced soundness this position.</p>
<p>Turning to British position generally, Secretary said he would not comment beyond saying he believed we had reached complete agreement that none of three powers would make any unilateral proposals without previous agreement, and consultation with Federal Government.</p>
<p>Final comment by Secretary concerned Algeria and fact we disturbed because we had reservations with regard present course events and how things would work out. French had tried commit us and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to support their policy Algeria and North Africa. Our analysis factors Algerian problem and trend nationalist sentiment in world, together with traditional United States sympathy aspiration peoples to independence combined create reservations as to wisdom present French <pb xml:id="pg_681" n="681" facs="0706"/>course action, though we had officially abstained from injecting ourselves in problem which treated by United Nations as internal French problem in spite its manifest international implications. Secretary asked if Algeria discussed recently with French and if so was it among points on which complete agreement existed with Federal Government. Chancellor and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> stated no word was said about Algeria in recent talks with French. Chancellor added <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had brought up subject privately with him at Marly during Chancellor’s Paris visit<note n="9" xml:id="d288fn9">See <ref target="#d203">Document 203</ref>.</note> and had spoken optimistically as to outcome, because of development FrancoMoroccan relations; but had not discussed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">Algeria?</hi>].</p>
<p>Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName>, probably speaking for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, had told him France could not approve armament 9 United States squadrons each of 25 planes unless we changed our position and agreed on certain things with French.<note n="10" xml:id="d288fn10">A memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DM1">debré</persName> on May 1 is printed in vol. VII, Part 2, <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> Secretary said he had told <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> he could see no link between these problems. French attitude this respect had been surprise and created difficulties for us. Chancellor said French had said nothing of all this to him.</p>
<p>Secretary concluded by assuring Chancellor our awareness complexity and urgency Berlin problem, and need not to lose sight of Berlin if “package” had to be untied. He added he appreciated Chancellor’s words with regard United States position on reunification.</p>
<p>Chancellor said he hoped we would exact as high a price as possible for summit meeting and give nothing away. He thought <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was being too generous in offering Soviets two hundred fifty million pounds in credits and summit conference for nothing.</p>

<item>Meeting Procedures and Western Coordination</item>
</list>
<p>The following conclusions were reached at the meeting:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> as senior Foreign Minister will accept responsibility for calling meetings of the Western Foreign Ministers as seems desirable.</p>
<p>(2) A quadripartite coordinating group at the Deputy level will meet at 10:30 every morning to review the previous day’s developments and prepare matters for the Ministers’ decision.</p>
<p>(3) That in connection with the argument with the Soviets over the shape of the table, the point of substance is not recognizing the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to the degree of permitting their seating at the table.<note n="1" xml:id="d289fn1">The shape of the table and the question of German participation had been under discussion since May 5 when it became clear that the Soviet Union would insist on full participation by the German Democratic Republic. Reports on these discussions were transmitted in telegrams 1436, 1444, 1454, and 1463 from Geneva, May 5–8. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 396.1–GE/5–559 through 5–859)</note> Once this point is settled <pb xml:id="pg_683" n="683" facs="0708"/>the shape of the table is irrelevant and in those circumstances we could accept a round table. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> at his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> later in the day will make this point. Meanwhile it was confirmed that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will not issue passes to the Council chamber to either German delegation for the Monday meeting.</p>
<p>(4) After responding to <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s welcome address (assuring a procedural debate did not then arise), Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> as Chairman will go around the table enabling each of the other three Foreign Ministers to make their opening statements. It was presumed that this round would be all that would be covered in the first session.</p>
<p>(5) The four Foreign Ministers agreed to meet together immediately after the close of the Monday conference session.</p>
<p>(6) That in order to avoid the formality of the 3-to-1 ratio of speeches, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> as Chairman on opening day would suggest that the chair recognize speakers who desired to speak during the course of the conference without regard to their position in the rotation.</p>
<p>(7) That advice would be sought from either German delegation during the sessions only by agreement of all four Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>(8) That Palthey<note n="2" xml:id="d289fn2">Georges M. Palthey, Deputy Director of the European Office of the United Nations at Geneva.</note> should be told that he could come and go and remain in the Council chamber as his duties required and that a place would be made available for him to sit but not of course at the conference table.</p>

<p rend="center">FULL DELEGATION MEETING</p>
<p>The Secretary opened the meeting by thanking all of the delegation for their efforts in preparing for the conference. He said he hoped to hold a number of similar meetings during the conference. In the meeting <pb xml:id="pg_684" n="684" facs="0709"/>today he wished to bring the U.S. delegation up to date on recent developments in the “battle of the square vs. round table,” which, he said, has serious overtones. Yesterday, the Western Foreign Ministers met in the afternoon<note n="1" xml:id="d290fn1">See <ref target="#d289">Document 289</ref>.</note> and concluded that the shape of the table was not in itself important but who sat at it was. He noted that the Soviets expect the Germans to sit at the table and to be full participants. The Secretary recalled that in the Western note to the Soviets we had suggested (and it had been agreed) that the Germans would be invited to attend and would be consulted.<note n="2" xml:id="d290fn2">See <ref target="#d176">Documents 176</ref> and <ref target="#d244">244</ref>.</note> The Secretary continued that the West has no intention of permitting the Germans to sit at the table. Yesterday, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> had been asked to convey the West’s views to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> reported that during his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at 5:00 p.m. yesterday the Russians had insisted on full participation by the Germans and their right to talk when they wished. In the matter of the shape of the table, the Russians seem disposed to compromise and would agree to a semi-circular table with tables at each end for the East and West Germans.<note n="3" xml:id="d290fn3">At 10 p.m. on May 9 Rumbold briefed members of the U.S. Delegation on the meeting between <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. A memorandum of this conversation, US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/1, is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1338.</note></p>
<p>The Secretary said that we opposed discussing procedural agreements with the Russians prior to the opening of the conference, preferring to discuss them officially in the Council Chamber. He concluded by saying that we will stand firm in our opposition to having the Germans as full participants; the West is agreed that the Germans will speak only when agreeable to all four Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWM1">Gibson</persName> commented that recognizing the Germans to speak would likely be a serious sticking point. The Secretary noted that in distinction to the 1955 conference in which the order of speakers rotated according to a set pattern, the chair, during the current meeting, will recognize speakers as it sees fit. This, it is hoped, will make the meetings more informal and enhance the possibility of fruitful negotiations.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that it is very likely that the Soviet delegates would approach members of the U.S. delegation offering invitations to social engagements. He suggested that all such invitations be coordinated by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> and that memoranda of conversation be written on all remarks by the Russians except pleasantries. The Secretary said he thought it desirable not to discourage contracts with the Russians. He hoped there would be full reporting on all contacts with the Russians.</p>
<p>The Secretary concluded the meeting by saying that we are not optimistic about the outcome of the conference. However, we will probe Soviet intentions and try hard to find areas where agreement might be reached.</p>

Four Western Foreign Ministers met informally this morning to discuss impasse with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> regarding shape of table, seating of German advisers and latter’s right to speak during conference sessions. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> reported talk he had with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> previous evening (as representative of other Western Ministers) along lines agreed by them previous afternoon. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> held out for horseshoe table seating four powers with two German groups seated at tables representing in effect extension of open ends. On German right to be heard, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> insisted it be unrestricted.</p>
<p>It was then decided <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> should return to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> before lunch and propose (A) circular table for four delegations with separate small square tables for the German advisers close to main table and with table for Secretariat between and (B) German representatives could speak by application to chair in absence any objection.</p>

Meanwhile formal opening conference scheduled for 3:30 was postponed.</p>
<p>After considerable discussion of four Ministers at <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s it was agreed (A) round table for four delegations with two separate square tables for two sets German advisers close to but not touching main conference table; (B) request of or for German advisers to speak would be communicated to Chairman who would respond “If no objection I call on, etc.”, accompanied by private agreement with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that objection would not be made unless privilege being abused in which case any Minister so considering would raise point of order under which Chairman would call recess immediately for purpose four Foreign Ministers in restricted session determining how to correct abuse, and (C) opening session would be held at 6 p.m. today and confined by agreement to <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s welcome and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s response on behalf himself and other three Foreign Ministers. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then to propose adjournment until 3:30 p.m. May 12. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> gave clear evidence intention raise question Polish-Czech participation at opening Tuesday meeting which he will chair.</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>First session opened<note n="1" xml:id="d292fn1">See <ref target="#d294">Document 294</ref>.</note> nearly three hours late because of continuous unresolved wrangling during day over seating arrangements for German delegates and rules applying to their right to speak during conference deliberations. At times wrangle assumed ridiculous proportions, but major issue at stake was Soviet effort secure for East Germany full representation and equal rights with four responsible powers. Final agreements satisfactory to us were reached only after hassle with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on our insistence Germans sit at separate tables. Conference room finally set up when <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed separate tables for Germans should be not more than six pencil widths apart from main table. In securing this exact measure, many pencils of many sizes were laid out but final exact measurement agreed to and conference allowed to proceed.</p>
<p>If today’s haggling any indication of days to come, patience and then some will be a very necessary requisite.</p>
<p>Faithfully,</p>

<item>Prospects for Foreign Ministers’ Conference and Nuclear Testing Agreement</item>
</list>
<p>Immediately following lunch the Secretary and myself were herded into a corner by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> who indicated that he wished to <pb xml:id="pg_690" n="690" facs="0715"/>have some serious conversation. He started off by asking how the Secretary thought the conference would go. The Secretary replied that the Soviets had made certain proposals with respect to Berlin and a peace treaty. We would present early in the conference comprehensive proposals covering not only Berlin and a peace settlement but reunification of Germany by stages and attendant security measures. He felt that this proposal when the Soviets examined it would be found to meet many if not all of the points on which they had expressed concern and that he was hopeful they would study it carefully to see if it was not a basis for agreement. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said they would study it and then gave the usual line on Berlin and the treaty as being ripe for settlement now.</p>
<p>There was considerable discussion back and forth with no ground given on either side. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did mention that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had told him before departure that he wanted him to do all possible to reach agreement at Geneva. He also acknowledged in principle the desirability of ultimate German reunification. The Secretary concluded this aspect of the conversation by stating that if we can reach agreement on reunification as an attainable objective then it will be relatively easy to solve on an interim basis Berlin which disappears as a problem when the unity of Germany is achieved. He added that the United States has no territorial or other ambitions. Its sole interest and the fundamental basis of its policy is to secure an enduring and just peace. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> immediately professed an identity of aim for Soviet foreign policy.</p>
<p>The Secretary then raised the question of the nuclear test talks by saying that he understood a recess had been agreed<note n="1" xml:id="d296fn1">Documentation on Phase III of the conference on nuclear weapons tests, April 13–May 8, is scheduled for publication in volume III.</note> and that Ambassador Wadsworth would be returning to Washington for consultation unless <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> intended to raise this subject in the present Foreign Ministers conference. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he thought it would be well for Wadsworth to remain here for the next two weeks since he thought it useful to discuss this matter with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and the Secretary. The French, he said, are obviously not concerned. (Subsequently a date for such discussion was made for Thursday, May 14.) <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that they were all pleased and encouraged in Moscow by the President’s latest letter<note n="2" xml:id="d296fn2">For text of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s letter to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, May 5, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1959</hi>, pp. 1309–1310.</note> on this subject to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. They thought it very constructive and that the gap between us had now become very slight. In fact he said the only outstanding problem was to decide on the number of tests which would not be automatic in the sense that justification for them would have to rest on some objective evidence from instruments.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_691" n="691" facs="0716"/>
<p>The Secretary said there were other matters than the question of number of inspections which stood between the Soviets and ourselves. The veto, for example, has not been clarified and is of course unacceptable to us. He said also there was considerable scientific data which the experts would have to study. He expressed the hope, however, that progress could be made rapidly toward agreement with adequate inspection provisions. He referred to the difficulties inherent in detection of underground explosions and shots remote in space.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he was prepared to sign the treaty while they were here in Geneva. He said if the Secretary was not prepared to go that far then he would suggest that he and the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> initial an agreement in principle with the details to be left to the experts to be worked out to the extent that they were still unagreed. The Secretary again expressed a desire to achieve agreement as soon as possible but gave no indication that he thought it could move as fast as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seemed to think.</p>
<p>The Secretary at this point said that he had a 3 o’clock engagement which he must meet.<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3"><persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> was scheduled to meet with <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> at 3 p.m., presumably to prepare for the second Foreign Ministers meeting at 3:30. No record of the four Western Foreign Ministers meeting has been found.</note> Neither <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> nor the Secretary raised any substantive or procedural points relating to the afternoon’s forthcoming session of the conference. Throughout the conversation <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seemed at great pains to establish a conciliatory and even friendly atmosphere.</p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> raised question, referring Soviet position as already stated in diplomatic notes, legitimate interests of Poland and Czechoslovakia on questions relating to Germany, including Berlin and preparation peace treaty, already recognized by all of us, though decision on participation deferred to Conference itself. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> maintained not merely point of procedure involved but one of considerable political importance.</p>
<p>Question of importance for success of Conference and also elementary justice to governments concerned. Admittedly other governments also have legitimate interests, as recognized by Soviet position re participation peace conference. But precisely Poland and Czechoslovakia most entitled participate at present stage discussions. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> dismissed suggestion that they participate merely as observers by pointing out that their people had hardly been just observers in struggle against Hitler aggression and occupation. Poles and Czechs have won right to participate and nobody else can represent their interests in discussions re Germany. Since war’s end they have repeatedly had occasion to state their view on German problems and have also extended a hand of peace, which, however, had been grasped only by one part of Germany—<gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> rejected view it would be fair to deny their participation on grounds that authorized balance of Conference might thereby be changed, pointing out that Conference decisions would not be achieved in any case by merely counting votes.</p>
<p>Secretary then gave US position (full text transmitted <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 20<note n="2" xml:id="d297fn2">Dated May 12. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/5–1259) For text of <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s statement, which stated that the conference should be limited to the four powers at its outset, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 21–23.</note>). <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> presented French view as follows:<note n="3" xml:id="d297fn3">For text of <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>’s statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/35, June 10, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., pp. 23–27.</note> question involved more general than mere participation of Poland and Czechoslovakia, and others than “we four” certainly involved especially as regards German peace treaty. This is not new issue and already raised in connection post-war “satellite” peace treaties with Italy, etc. Solution then was to seek views of others concerned for Foreign Ministers deputies to consider, and certain powers then additionally invited to appear before Conference to present views, as Yugoslavia in case of Italian Treaty. And after four powers had formulated their drafts, peace Conference held with others present. Admittedly Polish and Czech question now arises in somewhat different light, fourteen years after war and not just question of peace treaty involved. But in French viewpoint not yet reached where we will be drawing up peace treaty and therefore calling on powers for their views.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_693" n="693" facs="0718"/>
<p>At present stage main responsibility lies on four powers involved in administration Germany. This particularly true for Berlin where we four bear special responsibilities. Berlin and German unification are questions involving squarely responsibility of four powers. This not new point and at 1955 Geneva Summit<note n="4" xml:id="d297fn4">For documentation on the Geneva Summit Conference, July 18–23, 1955, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, vol. V</ref>, pp. 119 ff.</note> we all recognized our fundamental responsibilities. Certainly Poland and Czechoslovakia and particularly Poland have legitimate interests in peace treaty. But others are also concerned, as Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg, and are entitled be consulted in due course, Italy also. But at outset and at this stage only we four should be involved. This both best procedure and also appropriate since problems before US include some which are exclusive and primary responsibility of ours. Therefore, best to postpone further consideration this question.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he would be brief<note n="5" xml:id="d297fn5">For text of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s statement, as taken from the U.S. Delegation verbatim record, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 27–28.</note> since UK views already largely expressed by US and France. He hoped Soviet would not persist with matter which premature now. Conference issues would not be decided by counting of heads, as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> himself had admitted, and there are practical considerations, including consideration that smaller the conference more likely we are to achieve results, and question of principle also involved since others also have legitimate interests, including certainly Italy.</p>
<p>Thus, if we should accept either of two Soviet criteria (geographic proximity or victim of Hitler aggression) where could we stop? Therefore, better to postpone problem and get on with practical work of Conference.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> restated Soviet position,<note n="6" xml:id="d297fn6">For text of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement, as taken from the U.S. Delegation record, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 28.</note> admitting that while others besides Poland and Czechoslovakia suffered from Nazi aggression, some nations suffered more than others, and especially Poland and Czechoslovakia. Claimed no convincing arguments had been put forth to justify postponement this issue, adding that if Poland and Czechoslovakia had right to raise question, what right did we have to postpone decision. Thirdly, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> rejected US suggestion that better to proceed with matters of substance, claiming that Conference would be “acting lightly” if it treated question as procedural one. Soviets, Poland, Czechoslovakia and many other governments “attached great importance to matter”.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_694" n="694" facs="0719"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> invited further comments by others but all three indicated no desire speak further. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then declared that matter could not be left here and could not regard discussion this point as closed, suggesting adjournment until tomorrow.

<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wished to avoid any procedural wrangle in today’s meeting and, therefore, wished to reach an understanding on what would happen at the meeting today. Yesterday Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made a brief reply to the remarks of the Western Ministers on the question of Polish and Czech participation but these were preliminary remarks and he wished to make a considered reply at the meeting today.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> had a general statement he wished to make but he would open the meeting by asking if any other Minister wished to speak and would, of course, recognize Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> if he so desired. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> then remarked that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should be inscribed on the list of speakers.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_695" n="695" facs="0720"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> then said he wished to discuss the question of Polish and Czech participation. We had mentioned that this matter could be taken up later but it was not clear what we meant by the word later. Was it one or two days?</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that our position was that this would depend upon developments at the Conference. Our position was that we wished a serious discussion which we thought could best be handled by a meeting of the four powers. We would put forward proposals which included questions in which other powers did not have responsibilities. If the discussion went well, it was conceivable that in 10 days or two weeks it might be appropriate for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to raise the matter again. If, for example, we had reached agreement on reunification of Germany and the formation of an all-German Government, it might be appropriate to enlarge the Conference considerably.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> said we had mentioned the possibility of adding other countries but a number of countries had been named and he wondered if we had any specific thought in mind. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> pointed out the difficulty of shutting the door once it had been opened at all as had been pointed out by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> yesterday. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> indicated that we had no specific suggestions to put forward at this time.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> then raised the question of the seating of the German Delegations and said that while they did not wish to raise it to the level of Ministers, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had asked them to take up the question. They had been annoyed at the way the Secretariat had handled this problem. There had been agreement between the Ministers that the Germans would have ten chairs at the table but the Secretariat had placed only six. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out that he had been present<note n="1" xml:id="d298fn1">Presumably this was the meeting described by <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> in his message to the President on May 11, (see <ref target="#d292">Document 292</ref>), but no record has been found concerning the number of chairs to be placed at the table.</note> but there had been no agreement on the number of chairs for the German Delegations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was very emphatic that there had been such an agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> mentioned there had been some discussion of passes and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> said that this had been satisfactorily agreed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said there appeared to be a misunderstanding, which should be cleared up, and he undertook to consult Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> about the matter. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> pointed out that neither the British nor French Delegations had understood that any agreement had been reached by the Ministers on the number of German chairs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> made clear that in attempting to resolve the misunderstanding, <pb xml:id="pg_696" n="696" facs="0721"/>he did not mean to indicate that more chairs could be added. He said he thought the Soviets had come out very well on this matter as he had been reading the Soviet press of yesterday. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> said he had not read these accounts. The matter was left that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> would consult Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and then speak to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> privately.<note n="2" xml:id="d298fn2">At the Western Deputies coordinating meeting held at 10:30 a.m. Rumbold reported that a similar approach had been made to him by <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> at 10 that morning. (Memorandum of conversation, US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/9; Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_P1">CF</gloss> 1338)</note></p>
<p>After speaking to the Secretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> tried unsuccessfully to call Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> before lunch and finally reached him at 2:45 p.m. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that further to the discussion this morning he had spoken to the Secretary as he had said he would. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s recollection was clear that there had been no agreement nor even discussion on the question of number of chairs for the German advisers during the course of the meeting at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s house Monday. He said that the Secretary would not consider changing the existing arrangements and hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would not feel it necessary to raise this matter. He concluded by saying that he had also spoken to a member of the British Delegation who was present at the meeting in question and that his recollection was identical with ours.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> replied coldly that he would report this to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and the conversation closed.</p>

He stressed peaceful aim of Soviet Union. On Germany, he welcomed fact that representatives of “two German states” were present at conference, and emphasized only way to solve German question is through direct negotiations between representatives of two German states.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> repeated familiar arguments in favor of conclusion German peace treaty and “ normalization” of dangerous situation in West Berlin through ending occupation regime there.</p>
<p>He said Soviet Government is encouraged by similarity of views existing between governments on several questions. He cited as examples <pb xml:id="pg_698" n="698" facs="0723"/>communiqué following <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> talks,<note n="6" xml:id="d299fn6">For text of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> communiqué, March 3, see RIIA, <hi rend="italic">Documents on International Affairs, 1959</hi>, pp. 11–14.</note> <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>’s statement on German frontiers,<note n="7" xml:id="d299fn7">Not further identified.</note> and “more realistic approach to German problem” shown recently by statements of leading U.S. officials. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> also noted warmer relations between U.S. and USSR resulting from <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s visit to U.S. and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s forthcoming trip to Moscow.<note n="8" xml:id="d299fn8">Regarding <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s visit to the United States in January, see <ref target="#d121">Documents 121</ref> and <ref target="#d135">135</ref>–<ref target="#d137">137</ref>; regarding the Vice President’s trip to the Soviet Union, see <ref target="#d466">Document 466</ref>.</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on to say that other actions, such as establishment U.S. atomic-missile bases abroad and atomic arming of Bundeswehr served only to increase the differences between states. They could “make difficult if not impossible successful outcome present talks.” Moreover, Soviet Government, if it wished, could also present its partners in talks with accomplished facts in political as well as in military fields. But <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was not desired by Soviet Government, which wished to narrow difficulties between states rather than expand them.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> expressed concern at reports that West will attempt to link all political elements concerning European settlement into one bundle which will be impossible to untie.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said it would not be feasible to solve all problems at one sitting. Therefore Soviet Government proposes for consideration only conclusion of German Peace Treaty and normalization of West Berlin.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers Conference, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated, will also have to agree on time, place and agenda of Summit Meeting. He emphasized importance Soviet Government attaches to Summit and he hoped such meetings could be held on regular basis. He therefore welcomed view of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> that Summit meeting would mark beginning of period of talks between East and West.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s remarks were brief and informal, largely devoted to comments on points made by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.<note n="9" xml:id="d299fn9">For text of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/6, May 16, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 47–49 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 11–12.</note> He said Western powers do not share Soviet view concerning existence two sovereign German states and likewise do not believe that way to solve German problem is through negotiation between Germans.</p>
<p>Referring to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks re linking of political problems together, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that, of course, it must be recognized that problems are interrelated. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> also noted that Western powers were not <pb xml:id="pg_699" n="699" facs="0724"/>“forcing pace” on arms modernization program, but were fulfilling program decreed on sometime ago.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> echoed hopes of others that present meeting could make progress on at least some issues and that way could be opened to Summit.</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned about 6:00 p.m.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 4. For the President from the Secretary.</p>
<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>Little to report on progress since yesterday and today were spent on the question of seating the Poles and Czechs, with formal statements by each delegation head today. We hope to present our package tomorrow and then start serious negotiations.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> invited me to lunch yesterday and tried to probe our general ideas on the course the conference would take.<note n="1" xml:id="d300fn1">See <ref target="#d296">Document 296</ref>.</note> He emphasized his instructions from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to do everything to try to make the negotiations fruitful.</p>
<p>On the nuclear testing talks, he suggested the possibility of our initialing an agreement here with details left for further discussion by the existing negotiating teams. I told him I saw no possibility of doing this in view of the importance of many unresolved matters which would still take considerable time to adjust if at all. He asked for a session with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> and myself tomorrow which we will attend, but <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> agrees with me fully regarding the impossibility of any such short-cut as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> suggested.<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2"><persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> reached this decision at a meeting at noon. The U.S. Delegation transmitted a brief summary of this meeting in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 30 from Geneva, May 13. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/5–1359)</note> The latter has indicated there is only one real <pb xml:id="pg_700" n="700" facs="0725"/>question at issue: namely, the number of inspections, and that this was a political question we could settle quickly. On the whole, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s attitude was relaxed and genial. I would suspect this is only an opening of a conference atmospheric posture.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>’s illness may prove to be a real handicap for our side, so I am hoping for his quick recovery.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">Daily Analysis of Soviet Positions at Conference</p>
<p>1. The Secretary asked that a daily analysis be prepared of the Soviet presentations at the Conference for rebuttal purposes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>, in coordination with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName>, will make arrangements for the production of such an analysis.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Liaison with Other Delegations</p>
<p>2. In reply to the Secretary’s inquiry, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> explained that certain officers have been assigned to keep in touch with the British, French, German, and Soviet Delegations in Geneva.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Tactics at Conference</p>
<p>3. There was general discussion of the chairmanship of the session this afternoon. It was noted that the French are scheduled to be in the <pb xml:id="pg_701" n="701" facs="0726"/>chair today, but that with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> ill a problem has arisen. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> asked whether the Secretary thought it important to encourage the French to hold the chair. The Secretary said he did not attach great importance to the French being in the chair today. It was agreed that the matter would be worked out in the Deputies Coordinating Group.<note n="1" xml:id="d301fn1">At the Deputies Coordinating Group meeting at 10:30 a.m. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, Rumbold, <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> agreed that the French would retain the chair even if <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> could not attend the session. (Memorandum of conversation, US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/11; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1338)</note> There was agreement, however, that it would be important to have a Western Foreign Minister in the chair on Friday.<note n="2" xml:id="d301fn2">May 15.</note></p>
<p>There was discussion about whether the Western Peace Plan<note n="3" xml:id="d301fn3">See <ref target="#d295fn1">footnote 1, Document 295</ref>.</note> should be distributed to the delegations as a Conference document or read by the Secretary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> suggested that it would be desirable for the Secretary to read the Plan. He pointed out that this would consume time and, since France and the UK are expected to follow our presentation with short supporting statements, the West would probably get a clear press tomorrow.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Timing of Subsequent Sessions</p>
<p>4. The Secretary inquired whether the Russians would want time to study our Peace Plan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> thought that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would probably seek full instructions from Moscow before making any significant reaction to our proposals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> thought it desirable not to meet on Saturday and to try to adhere to a five-day week, at least at the outset of the Conference. The Secretary suggested that if there were no meeting on Saturday, that that day might be the best time for him to visit Rome.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Consultation on Geneva Conference</p>
<p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that the report of yesterday’s private meeting of the North Atlantic Council had brought out no adverse criticism of our proposals.<note n="4" xml:id="d301fn4">A report on the discussion of the Western Peace Plan by the North Atlantic Council on May 13 was transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Polto1">Polto</gloss> 3256 from Paris, May 13. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/5–1359)</note></p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Czech-Polish Participation</p>
<p>6. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> thought that the Russians would probably return to the question of Czech-Polish participation, possibly urging the participation of the Poles alone. He thought that we should begin to develop a position on participation by the Poles alone.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_702" n="702" facs="0727"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Press Reaction to Conference</p>
<p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said that press coverage in Western Europe and the United States has been mainly a preview of our presentation. Keen interest has been shown in the Czech-Polish issue. The Secretary’s opening statement received good play. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> noted that the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> today had carried our official summary of the Plan, and he suggested that it had been given to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> in Washington. He noted that the Russian briefing officers are singling out the French for criticism on their attitude toward the Conference.</p>

<p>After a detailed discussion of nuclear test suspension negotiations,<note n="1" xml:id="d302fn1">A memorandum of this part of the conversation, US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/31, is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1338; a summary was transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 40 from Geneva, May 14 at 9 p.m. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> turned to the subject of enlarging the participation in the <pb xml:id="pg_703" n="703" facs="0728"/>Foreign Ministers’ Conference. He said that almost twenty-four hours had passed since his statement yesterday<note n="2" xml:id="d302fn2">See <ref target="#d299">Document 299</ref>.</note> and that he was expecting new views to be presented by the West.</p>
<p>Both the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> pointed to difficulties in limiting the number of participants once the number was enlarged beyond the present four. They indicated that some other countries, such as Belgium, were already insisting on being admitted as participants if Poland and Czechoslovakia were included. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that it would be better to try first to explore the situation and see whether a prospect of agreement on broader issues exists. The Secretary observed that if the number of participants in the present conference was enlarged, this would create a precedent for broader participation in a summit meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he could not agree that the smaller the conference the more effective it is. He recalled larger conferences in the past, such as the conference on Indochina,<note n="3" xml:id="d302fn3">Documentation on the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference on Korea and Indochina, April 26–July 20, 1954, is presented in <ref target="frus1952-54v16"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, volume XVI</ref>.</note> claiming that the broadening of participation in a conference does not necessarily create difficulties. He expressed hope that the West would agree to the Soviet proposal on this subject and pressed for specific counter-proposals from the Western Powers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Western arguments against enlarging the participation in the present conference were not convincing and expressed confidence that a solution which would satisfy everybody could be found. As to participation in a summit meeting, he said that admission of other powers to a foreign ministers’ meeting could not be taken as a precedent for a summit meeting and that the question of participation in such a meeting should be considered separately. He also indicated that he would again raise this question in one of the meetings.</p>

Fourth Session Foreign Ministers Conference began 3:30 p.m. May 14. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>, who was in chair, stated US representative had requested to speak, as well as representatives East Germany and of Federal Republic. He suggested latter two could be heard after Secretary’s statement and any comments thereon others wished to make.</p>
<p>Secretary then spoke, giving introductory statement on Western peace plan and then reading plan in full. (Text of Secretary’s remarks and plan sent separately by USIS.)<note n="1" xml:id="d303fn1">For <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/8 and 7, May 14, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 50–60; <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 218–223; or Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 1, 1959, pp. 776–781.

<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> in their turn stressed that peace plan was effort of all three Western powers and they associated their governments with plan and with Secretary’s remarks thereon. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> urged Soviets to regard plan as serious effort to meet Soviet views and to bridge gap between us.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> then gave floor to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz. Bolz</persName> stated he spoke “on behalf <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, her govt and her people.”<note n="2" xml:id="d303fn2">For text of <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName>’ statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/A/1, June 4, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 564–565 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 177–178.</note> At several points he stressed he was speaking as representative German people. He said German people want peace and claimed <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has no revanchist aims. <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> wants to work for peace and to end division of Germany. Preparation of peace treaty is best and shortest way to end division of Germany and to bring two Germanies closer together. Also, peace treaty cannot overlook solution of Berlin problem.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> plan includes confederation of two German states and envisages conversations between the two German states, which <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> said “are inevitable.”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> stated two delegations from two German states now are seated at similar tables and are on similar footing at conference. <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Delegation is ready to discuss with Delegation from Federal Republic all measures concerning peace treaty and creation unified Democratic German state.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_705" n="705" facs="0730"/>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> then spoke for Federal Republic.<note n="3" xml:id="d303fn3">For text of <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>’s statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/A/6, June 6, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 533–535 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 179–181.</note> He expressed warm support for Western peace plan which he said Federal Republic had helped to shape. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> stressed that reunification of great German people is indispensible prerequisite to any settlement of German problem, which cannot be made in isolation.</p>
<p>Federal Republic supports concept of freely negotiated peace treaty, which requires freely elected all-German Govt.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> agreed with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement yesterday that normalization of situation in Berlin and in Germany is necessary. This is also aim of Federal Republic. However, Federal Republic cannot agree with Soviets when they say that division of Germany must be recognized as realistic fact. This is unnatural situation; German people must be reunited, must determine own form govt, must have self-determination.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said that West has made concession to Soviet viewpoint in presenting plan in which German elections are postponed. Federal Republic agreed to this with certain apprehension, but did so in order to make positive contribution to solution of problem.</p>
<p>Secretary then spoke, referring to statements by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> re existence of two states in Germany. Secretary emphasized that, in US view, there is only one govt in Germany entitled to speak for the German people. This is Federal Republic of Germany, which rests on mandate of free elections. US agreement to presence and statements by representatives so-called <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> can in no way be construed as recognition by US of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Representatives latter are at conference only as advisors. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> rejoined that, whether US likes it or not, there are two German states—<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>—and this cannot change no matter what title is given to representative of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> at conference.<note n="4" xml:id="d303fn4">For text of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement as recorded in the U.S. Delegation verbatim record, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 61–62.</note> After <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> supported Secretary’s statement re non-recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>,<note n="5" xml:id="d303fn5">For text of <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>’s statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/36, June 10, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 62.</note> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he had nothing further to add to his previous remarks on this subject, meeting adjourned at 5:45 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> emphasized strongly the significance of the Mixed German committee idea in the Western Peace Plan.<note n="2" xml:id="d304fn2">See <ref target="#d295fn1">footnote 1, Document 295</ref>.</note> He pointed out that the 25–10 ratio was very favorable to the East Germans and that through the 3/4 majority requirement the plan contained a built-in veto. Nothing could be done without the agreement of both sides. This was a new proposal, he said, something quite different from anything that had been advanced in 1955 and he hoped very much the Russians would be willing to accept it. Their acceptance of this idea would offer the basis for a broader agreement which would inevitably follow.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s reaction to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s comments was completely wooden. It was apparent the Russians were not reacting to the details of the plan or to its merits; they merely recited their old arguments. Let the two German <pb xml:id="pg_707" n="707" facs="0732"/>Governments settle the whole business, said <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Let them agree on the steps that should be taken. If they can sit down and work out their future, then the four occupying powers should be willing to accept whatever decisions they might make.</p>
<p>The Secretary replied that this would be a possible procedure if <hi rend="italic">the people</hi> of the two areas were permitted to decide their future. The only way they could do this was by the process of free elections. As things stood now only one of the German Governments had the right to speak for its people; the other did not.</p>
<p>The Secretary then asked why the Soviet Union had emphasized the problem of European security in 1955 and was not now saying anything about it. If it were so important <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, why had it lost all its significance now?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the Soviets have not changed their attitude about this problem; the importance of European security remained. No one would question that. However, the Soviet Union believed it was better to reach agreement in Geneva on a limited area such as the problem of Berlin and the conclusion of the peace treaty. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> also repeated the Soviet argument that it was a serious mistake to tie up disarmament with the German problem. The latter was hard enough to solve anyway. The experience of the past few years had proven the complexity of the disarmament problem and when we injected that into the Western proposal, it became infinitely more difficult to reach agreement. And Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> emphasized the Russians really wanted to get agreement. They are willing to be reasonable and would go along with any kind of meetings whether they be informal discussions, formal discussions among the four, meetings with other states present, etc. Any method or technique by which agreement might be reached would be agreeable to them.</p>
<p>At one point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested the desirability of more informal discussions of the type that was taking place last night. The Secretary expressed the view that it would be better to go ahead in formal sessions permitting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to put forth his proposal. This would be followed by comments on the two proposals. After that, he said, we might resume the informal discussions among the four. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicated that it was his intention to submit a lengthy statement today in the nature of a proposal with the probability that he would make another statement rebutting the Western Peace Plan on Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> commented at some length on the undesirability of bringing Poland and Czechoslovakia into the meetings, following up some remarks to the same effect which he had made at dinner. If we accepted the Soviet criteria, he said, then other countries like Denmark, Holland, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, as well as Italy and Canada would have to be invited to the table. This would make it much more <pb xml:id="pg_708" n="708" facs="0733"/>difficult to get agreement. It would be far better, he said, to settle the problem among the four. At this time, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s answer was in general terms, but, at dinner, when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had referred to several possible participants, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> interjected, “Do you make proposal?”</p>
<p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s comment that the Soviet Union had no ulterior motives in its desire to solve the German problem, the Secretary asked why the May 27 deadline had been imposed. Had not the Soviet Government threatened the conclusion of a separate peace treaty which would in effect be an attempt unilaterally to abrogate the rights of the four powers in Berlin? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he was sorry that we had raised the May 27 issue—that he had not intended to raise it until the end of the conference. The Secretary then pointed out that there would be no Summit Conference if this meeting of the Foreign Ministers ended on a threatening note. Certainly the United States would not go to a Summit meeting as a result of any ultimatum of this kind.<note n="3" xml:id="d304fn3">On May 15 <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> cabled President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> a summary of this conversation and quoted in full this paragraph. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> went on to say that he wanted <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to be absolutely clear that if the Conference failed the Soviet Union could not force the President to a Summit meeting. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s summary was transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 7 from Geneva, May 15 at 5 p.m. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/5–1559)</note></p>
<p>So far as the writers of this memorandum are concerned, the main impact of the meeting was that the Soviets were repeating over and over again in different ways the same old refrain: why can’t we pick out two or three things that we can agree upon and forget about the rest?</p>

<pb xml:id="pg_709" n="709" facs="0734"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made lengthy, formal statement largely devoted to exposition Soviet peace treaty proposal.<note n="1" xml:id="d305fn1">For text of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/10, May 15, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 63–74 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 17–26.</note> He noted that lack of peace settlement with Germany was great source tensions in world. Division of Europe into two armed camps, for which creation of military grouping of Western powers is responsible, has deepened. Tremendous armaments in possession Western European states menace not only Soviet Union but other states as well since third world war would have no limits. If peace treaty had been concluded with Germany at proper time, there would be different situation today. In that event, one could not imagine inclusion of Federal Republic in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, supplying of Bundeswehr with atomic weapons and missiles, and revanchist statements of Western Germans. Also, outmoded occupation status of West Berlin creates dangers and results from absence of peace treaty. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> claimed Soviet Union had always done everything possible to contribute to peace settlement and had helped implementation Potsdam decision in East Germany. In contrast, Nazi influence still important in Western Germany and militarization of Federal Republic undermines European security. Foreign policy of Federal Republic also increases tension and Federal Republic interferes with all attempts tending toward resolution of difficult international problems.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted that important contribution to peace had been made with signing of treaties with former allies of Hitler. Austrian Peace Treaty also had been concluded. Now it is necessary to continue work and solve most important problem remaining from war, i.e., peace treaty with Germany. Although Soviet Union and Western powers have different approach to German problem, both should be united in same aim, which is to prevent resurgence German militarism.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said basic objection of those who opposed peace treaty with Germany is that there is today no government which can sign treaty for all of Germany. This is formalistic juridical argument, however, which ignores factual situation in Germany, where two independent sovereign states now exist. Presence in conference room of official representatives of governments of these two states is convincing evidence of this reality.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> claimed that to wait for all-German Government to be formed before signing peace treaty means postponing peace treaty for undefined time. Also, he asserted that efforts of Federal Republic to interfere with cooperation between two German states was poor augury for reunification process.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_710" n="710" facs="0735"/>
<p>In present situation, Soviet Government believes only possibility is to conclude peace treaty with two German States, and, in addition, with German confederation if such is formed at time of signing of treaty. To refuse to sign treaty today would mean deepening of differences between <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Federal Republic.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then criticized Western powers for not recognizing <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He said USSR had recognized Federal Republic, not because it liked Federal Republic policies, but because USSR believes that no progress can be made in resolving German problem without Federal Republic as well as <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Although reunification Germany concerns Germans primarily, peace treaty affects interests of many peoples in Europe and elsewhere. Reunification of Germany is very important and Soviet Union supports solution of this question on peace loving and democratic basis. However, if Federal Republic is not ready to agree with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> on solution of this question, then only possibility is to wait until Federal Republic adopts more realistic position.</p>
<p>Peace treaty is different question however. Its postponement would harm interests of peace. Therefore, Soviet Government believes that Foreign Ministers Conference should concentrate principal attention on question of peace treaty.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then commented in some detail on various provisions draft Soviet peace treaty enclosed with Soviet note January 10.<note n="2" xml:id="d305fn2">See <ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>.</note> (Text draft Soviet peace treaty<note n="3" xml:id="d305fn3">For text of the Soviet draft treaty, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/11, May 15, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 74–88 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 223–235. See also <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985</hi>, pp. 629.</note> tabled subsequently.)</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks concerning peace treaty contained nothing essentially new. He sharply attacked military preparations in West Germany, such as installation missile launching pads, and claimed people of Germany did not wish this fate but wished opportunity follow peaceful life. This would be provided for in Soviet peace treaty. Of course, there would be some restrictions on German national armed forces, and Germany would not be permitted to produce atomic arms or means of delivery of atomic arms. However, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted, these restrictions would not go further than restrictions already contained in Paris Accords between Federal Republic and Western powers.<note n="4" xml:id="d305fn4">For texts of the agreements signed at Paris on October 23, 1955, see <ref target="frus1952-54v05p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. V, Part 2</ref>, pp. 1435–1457.</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> also spoke of Soviet plan for withdrawal of foreign troops from Germany, by states if necessary. While Western powers claim that withdrawal of foreign troops would hurt Western security, this is not true and Soviet proposal demands nothing from West which <pb xml:id="pg_711" n="711" facs="0736"/>not also demanded of Soviet Union. Also, fear that Soviet armed forces would be nearer to German borders than Western forces, after withdrawal, is unfounded, since armed forces of France, United Kingdom, Belgium and other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries would be just as close to Germany as Soviet forces.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> repeated that USSR is ready withdraw its armies not only from Germany but also from Poland and Hungry if <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries withdraw their forces within national boundaries and liquidate military bases in foreign territories. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted that eastern boundaries Germany were decided by Allies during war and that peace treaty should confirm this decision. So far as Berlin is concerned, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> outlined Soviet proposal for transforming West Berlin into free demilitarized city during transition period before German reunification. USSR is prepared to work out with other interested governments necessary guarantees for protecting new status of West Berlin.</p>
<p>Turning to Western plan<note n="5" xml:id="d305fn5">See <ref target="#d295fn1">footnote 1, Document 295</ref>.</note> presented by Secretary at yesterday’s session, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this plan covered many problems and he observed that it had been presented as an inseparable unit. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recalled that he had already indicated his objections to method which consisted of tying complicated questions together in manner which made their solution virtually impossible. If this path is followed, it could only lead into impasse. However, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Soviet Delegation would present more detailed views at later date concerning propositions contained in Western plan.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> terminated by emphasizing once again importance of conclusion peace treaty with Germany and expressing hope that others would cooperate in making achievement such treaty possible.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then made several comments<note n="6" xml:id="d305fn6">For text of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/12, May 15, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 88–93 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 26–30.</note> concerning <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement, although he said that if he did not respond to all of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s points it should not be thought that his silence meant that he accepted their validity. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> stated that we have our own views concerning who is responsible for division of Europe, and do not agree with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on this point. Also, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he did not share <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s views concerning Federal Republic and did not agree with his accusations against Federal Republic policies.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> went on to say that he wished to provide further explanation of Western peace plan tabled yesterday. He hoped that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would take this plan seriously and would not discard it out of hand.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_712" n="712" facs="0737"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said plan deals with many Soviet objections made to Western proposals in 1955. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then proceeded to enumerate differences (in accordance with approved Western background paper)<note n="7" xml:id="d305fn7">Not further identified.</note> concerning process of German reunification and European security. He also spoke briefly in support of Western transition plan for Berlin and stressed that all of these problems are related. While we may discuss them separately, they cannot be settled in isolation. All are linked and this is reason for their presentation in phased manner in Western plan.</p>
<p>No other representatives wished to speak following <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s remarks, and meeting adjourned at 5:35 p.m.</p>

<p>Secretary stated <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> owes us an explanation because in discussion on May 14<note n="1" xml:id="d308fn1">See <ref target="#d302fn1">Document 302 and footnote 1</ref> thereto.</note> he seemed to go quite far toward accepting widerange technical talks.</p>
<p>With respect to high altitude alone, Secretary stated he did not think we should accept at this time.

</list>
<p>This meeting opened with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> giving a report on his meeting earlier in the morning with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> came to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s villa at his own request, representing it as a return of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s courtesy call on him eight days earlier.<note n="1" xml:id="d309fn1">See <ref target="#d291">Document 291</ref>.</note> At the outset Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he could see three solutions for Berlin: (a) all Western troops leave and West Berlin becomes a free city, (b) Soviet troops join the Western forces in West Berlin, or (c) neutral troops replace Western troops in West Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he assumed our proposal for Berlin was merely a tactical opening position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> replied that he assumed this was an accurate description of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s three proposals. He then asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> what really troubled the Soviets about West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the situation was such that it might lead to incidents. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> rejoined that the arrangements had operated tolerably for the past ten years and there had been no incidents.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> that he was prepared to listen but not to talk about German reunification. He made critical remarks concerning <pb xml:id="pg_715" n="715" facs="0740"/>the Western package plan<note n="2" xml:id="d309fn2">See <ref target="#d295fn1">footnote 1, Document 295</ref>.</note> and noted that the Soviet peace treaty<note n="3" xml:id="d309fn3">See <ref target="#d305fn3">footnote 3, Document 305</ref>.</note> if desired could be amended to permit the two German states to remain for an interim period in their present alliance systems.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that he failed to understand <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s objection to our package proposal since the Soviet proposals were likewise a package containing exactly the same four elements. There was in it a peace treaty, certain of whose articles constituted security arrangements. There was a provision for reunification of Germany by the efforts of the two German states or some sort of confederation, and finally there was an interim solution for Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had no rejoinder to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s point.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he planned to speak today at length and that <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> would also speak. He then asked how Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> foresaw the conference developing. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he thought after two or three more days of formal presentations and rebuttals this phase of the conference would be ended. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked might it not then be well to move into private meetings? <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> apparently was noncommittal.</p>
<p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that he thought it was a mistake to show any apparent anxiety or interest in private meetings. After all the West, even if it is not perfectly satisfied with the existing situation in Europe, at least is reconciled to it. It is the Soviets who are seeking to upset the status quo. Under these circumstances it should be left to the Russians to take any initiative or make any counter proposals. After all if the conference ends in a deadlock, that reflects the existing situation and we could all go home.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that he could agree with most of what <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had said but he thought we must steer a middle course.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that we must remember that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> from the outset has been saying that the Foreign Ministers can do nothing, with the implication that a Summit meeting could do everything. He said that he felt that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should know that if no progress is made in the Foreign Ministers meeting, then there will be no Summit conference. There was general agreement expressed with this statement.</p>
<p>The meeting then turned to a discussion of tactics for the afternoon’s session on which agreement was reached.</p>
<p>In closing the Secretary said that he was expecting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> to be arriving in the next two days or so. He said that he had been an original member of the Delegation but had been detained in Washington by reason of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName>’ sudden death.<note n="4" xml:id="d309fn4"><persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> died on May 8.</note></p>

Sixth session Foreign Ministers Conference May 18 lasted three hours and devoted to East German outline objections to Western proposal and support Soviet views, US rebuttal Soviet Peace Treaty proposal, and lengthy (50 minutes) Soviet rejection Western peace plan.</p>
<p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recognized East German representative <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> who gave preliminary <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> views Western proposals at same time lauding Soviet views re peace treaty and Berlin.<note n="1" xml:id="d310fn1">For text of <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName>’ statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/A/2, June 4, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 565–570 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 181–186.</note> <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> regretted Western plan does not contain draft peace treaty and surprised that West Germans also failed mention this matter so urgently desired by German people, in order end consequences World War, normalize German relations and restore German sovereignty. Urgency heightened by efforts German militarists. Treaty would permit all Germany enter onto path democratic development, free West Berlin of occupation regime, make civil war impossible and help bring about German reunification.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> admitted <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had previously supported all-German elections before situation so complicated and division of Germany so deep as at present. He contrasted conflicting trends two parts Germany, with Hitlerite elements, revanchist attitudes, etc., Western Germany, and peaceful anti-Fascist army without atomic or rocket arms in <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> where all concentrating on building socialism. Therefore, impossible to “unify mechanically” now. Unification only possible through getting together of two Germanies, and to prepare <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> proposed confederation with all German council based parity principle. Unification not something this Conference can usefully tackle. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> also emphasized unity, economic and social growth <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, plus its relations with other states which include one-half of mankind. Four powers could, however, help if they wish re peace treaty.</p>
<p>Berlin problem also urgent, with situation in West Berlin abnormal, danger to peace and only territory in Europe still constituting occupation regime. Attack being waged from West Berlin on <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and also basis for cold war against other countries. Dangerous situation could lead <pb xml:id="pg_717" n="717" facs="0742"/>to war. Hence, <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> proposal for “free city” West Berlin, which <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> prepared to accept even though West Berlin “on territory of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>”. <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> could not accept Western proposal to submit democratic sector of Berlin to occupation regime once more, which would violate <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> territory and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Western proposals contain no appropriate basis for conclusion German treaty or solution West Berlin problem and Western plan contains artificial links between matters not properly related. Peace treaty conference should be convened soonest.</p>

United Germany only possible through agreement two German states. Referring all German committee, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> admitted some all German body necessary but this must be decided by Germans themselves.

<p>Therefore Western plan cannot in any way serve as basis discussion this conference. Clearly unacceptable and unrealistic. Soviets do not say Western plan contains elements that cannot be discussed, for example, <pb xml:id="pg_718" n="718" facs="0743"/>disarmament and European security elements. Real objective Western plan clearly to delay peace treaty settlement indefinitely.

<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> discussed Berlin in terms similar those used <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName>.

<p rend="center">MEETING OF FOREIGN MINISTERS PALAIS DES NATIONS, GENEVA, 1959</p>
<p>I have serious doubts whether we should really attempt to solve the Berlin problem at this Conference. There is some possibility that the Soviets would agree to a solution based on the agency principle. Even if <pb xml:id="pg_719" n="719" facs="0744"/>this were accomplished, however, our position at the Summit meeting would have been undermined to some extent by the implied acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. There is a greater possibility that if we indicated here a willingness to settle on the basis of the agency principle, the Soviets would merely pocket this concession by saying that the matter had to be settled at the Summit unless their proposals were accepted.</p>
<p>It would seem to me better for us to stand firm on Berlin at this meeting but avoid the dangers of possible Soviet action regarding Berlin by agreeing to a Summit Conference which would make unlikely any dangerous Soviet move before such meeting. Even if the present meeting is abortive, it seems unlikely that we could long avoid a Summit Conference, particularly in view of the British position. The difficulty of this solution is to find some action which could be taken at the meeting which would justify holding a Summit Conference. It we are firm on Berlin, the Soviets are likely to cooperate in finding some justification for a Summit meeting. It seems likely that a settlement of the atomic testing problem could be found in the course of this Conference. This, together with a reasonable Soviet attitude on the agenda for a Summit meeting might be sufficient justification.</p>
<p>It might be possible to probe Soviet intentions in order to find out whether they would be willing to settle the Berlin problem at this meeting but I suggest that this should be done privately. It might be best to have <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> do this, particularly as he is apt to do so anyway, and if the British knew that we were prepared to agree to a Summit Conference, we could probably persuade them to take a stronger position on Berlin.</p>

The Secretary asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> to see <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> and ask him to clarify the matter.

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 396.1–GE/5–1859)</note> to the Department he had drafted on Berlin Contingency Planning. The Secretary indicated his concurrence. The Secretary added that he thought it important to be prepared on exactly how and when we might take the Berlin question to the Security Council and what we would say at that time.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Briefing on Geneva Meeting for President’s Press Conference</p>
<p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said that we are preparing answers to several questions about the Geneva Conference for possible briefing of the President for his press conference tomorrow.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Press Reaction to Conference</p>
<p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> thought that this week the press may concentrate on those elements of our plan which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has indicated might be the subject of individual agreements.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName></p>
<p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> asked for guidance on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>’s joining the delegation tomorrow. The Secretary thought we should say that <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> had been originally selected by the President to go to Geneva and had planned to come at the same time as the rest of the delegation. However, the death of Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quarles</persName> had delayed <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>. Now that conditions permitted <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> to be absent from Washington, he planned to join the delegation. The Secretary said we should stress that <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>’s coming to Geneva at this time had no particular significance.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_722" n="722" facs="0747"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Press Guidance</p>
<p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> suggested that we might take the following line with the press: (1) This week we will spell out to the Russians the elements of the Western Peace Plan in order to make sure they fully understand it; and (2) we will offer more comprehensive criticism of the Soviet proposals.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion of Separate Points in Western Plan</p>
<p>8. The Secretary inquired whether we had identified the points that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is expected to pick out of our Plan for separate discussion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> said that he would have a paper for the Secretary on this today. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> observed that we might take the same line as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, namely that a distinction should be drawn between the possibility of discussing the particular items separately and the question of negotiating or applying them individually.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 81. From the Secretary. Department pass Defense. I met May 19 with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> again to seek Soviet agreement for technical discussions on capabilities detection and identification seismic events and technical criteria for inspections. Pointed out if scientists are to meet prior to June 8 resumption Nuclear Test Talks, decision needed as soon as possible. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was completely intransigent, denied any area of agreement in our discussion of May 14<note n="1" xml:id="d313fn1">See <ref target="#d302fn1">Document 302 and footnote 1</ref> thereto.</note> except high altitude.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated he wanted position of Soviet Union made clear, that there is no relationship between the number of “suspicious events” and the number of inspections. He stated number of inspections is a political matter. He repeated this point several times and posed a direct question to both <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and me as to whether we agree there is no connection between “suspicious events” and the number of inspections.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_723" n="723" facs="0748"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and I both took the position that Soviet Union can use any basis it wishes for determining number of inspections. I stated that while ultimately a decision on the number of inspections would be made by appropriate policy officials in the U.S. Government and that although the Soviet Union can use any basis it wishes to determine the number of inspections, the U.S. decision on numbers of inspections will be made after considering all factors, particularly the findings and advice of our scientists.</p>
<p>We emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that no agreement on the cessation of nuclear testing can possibly be reached until there is agreement on the criteria to be applied to inspection of unidentified events. We spent greater part of meeting trying to explain this point to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, who expressed view we were only trying to justify more inspections.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> recited usual Soviet line expressing concern that our proposal for technical talks represents a step backward from agreement already reached and that Soviet Union would oppose any attempt to disavow findings technical experts last summer. We pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that we were not trying to disavow findings of experts but to improve the scientific basis upon which an agreement on nuclear test cessation can be reached.</p>

I shall also point out to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that if his attitude is an indication of the way the Soviet Union will cooperate in an agreement on the suspension of nuclear testing, the situation does not look promising.<note n="2" xml:id="d313fn2"><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> discussed this question further after dinner on May 19.

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 12. For the President from the Secretary.</p>
<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s refusal to attend a Summit meeting in the United States but his apparent willingness to let <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> attend as head of Government <pb xml:id="pg_726" n="726" facs="0751"/>has raised questions here regarding the site for a possible Summit Conference. The British apparently dislike Geneva but the French are of course insistent that Geneva is the best place. I have stated that we do not attach too much importance to the place of the Summit and would like to accommodate others if strong feelings are expressed. However, I believe that, in spite of the <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> position, we could be the determining voice in the selection because of the very valid excuse of your Constitutional problems as head of State and head of Government, and the sitting of Congress through the better part of the summer. I would appreciate knowing whether you have any thoughts on this subject so I can steer things quietly in that direction.<note n="1" xml:id="d315fn1">On May 20 the President replied that the location of a summit meeting made little difference to him and that <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> should feel completely free in making the decision. (<gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 28 to Geneva; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Central Files, 110.11–HE/5–2059)</note></p>
<p>There has been no real progress to date at the Conference. The statements by both sides are essentially negative to the other’s position. This sparring will probably continue the better part of the week and we tactically are not indicating overeagerness to put forward new proposals, hoping the Soviets will do so first.</p>
<p>Faithfully. Signed: Chris.”</p>

<pb xml:id="pg_727" n="727" facs="0752"/>
<p>The Foreign Minister said he wished first of all to raise two questions:</p>
<p>1. He said he expected that the Secretary had been informed that the subject of the draft Principles of a Peace Treaty<note n="1" xml:id="d316fn1">See <ref target="#d270">Document 270</ref>.</note> had been raised by journalists in the press, but that he had not mentioned it to them. However, the press was interested in this question, and as he was going to be seeing other journalists in the course of the day he would like to know what he should say in answer to the question whether the West intended to table these Principles.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he could only reply personally, but that he had no enthusiasm for raising this matter at this time. To do so was likely to involve us in an article by article discussion with the Soviets who would try to extract an agreed draft, and then conclude a separate Treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, on the grounds that it was an approved text. The Secretary commented that today’s <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> had published the Principles of a Peace Treaty. The Foreign Minister said he had also heard this, and had been told that the leak had occurred in Paris. The Secretary went on to say that before discussing a Peace Treaty at all, we should know whether such a Treaty would apply to a reunited Germany or not.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister agreed and said that the Soviets should fulfill the preliminary condition of agreeing to the reunification of Germany before the Principles of a Peace Treaty were discussed with them.</p>
<p>2. The Foreign Minister said he wished to raise a second point, which was giving him some concern: he had been informed that a Western Four Power working party had yesterday discussed the implementation of paragraphs 16, 17 and 25 of the Western Peace Plan, which deal with the subject of security zones. He understood that the working party had proposed that these zones should be discussed internally among the Four, and be defined. He personally had no particular objection to the discussion of paragraphs 16 and 17, but he had serious reservations about the discussion of paragraph 25 which was to be implemented under Stage 3. He was afraid that discussion now of this paragraph would lead in the direction of discussing some variant of the Rapacki Plan. The Secretary said he was not informed about what the working party had discussed, but that there was no authority for lifting the subject of security zones out of the rest of the Plan. Such zones should only be discussed within the context of the Western proposals. He added that he had been somewhat worried about the British attitude with regard to this subject, and that the Soviets would certainly like to lift it out of the Plan and discuss it separately. The Secretary proposed, and the Foreign Minister agreed, that this matter should be discussed on Thursday by <pb xml:id="pg_728" n="728" facs="0753"/>the Four Western Foreign Ministers. The Foreign Minister added that he was afraid of leaks, if the subject were discussed even internally, and that this would provoke the Russians to raising the issue. [6–1/2 <hi rend="italic">lines of source text not declassified</hi>] it was essential to make it clear beyond any doubt that security zones would not be discussed outside the framework of the Western Peace Plan.</p>
<p>The Secretary said there were only two subjects which might possibly be discussed separately:</p>
<list>
<item>1. A modus vivendi on Berlin;</item>
<item>2. The resumption of talks on general disarmament in an appropriate form.</item>
</list>
<p>The Foreign Minister said he agreed with the Secretary.</p>
<p>The Secretary asked the Foreign Minister whether the Federal Government would be interested in the possibility of setting up the Mixed German Committee independently of the acceptance by the Soviets of the Western Package. The Foreign Minister reacted sharply against this idea. He said he wished to make it quite clear that he had agreed to the Mixed German Committee only if the conditions of basic agreement by the Soviets to discuss German reunification had been met. If the Soviets insisted on the maintenance of the two German regimes, it would be highly dangerous to agree to the formation of the Committee, and the Soviets would do everything possible to confer on it functions and recognition which would serve the purposes of their policy.</p>
<p>He went on to say that he was leaving for Bonn on Saturday<note n="2" xml:id="d316fn2">May 23.</note> to talk things over with the Chancellor and with members of his party and, therefore, he had felt it would be useful to have this exchange of views with the Secretary. The conference was being followed very carefully in Bonn and not without some apprehension.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister said that in his last statement, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had attacked the Federal Government, and the persons of the Chancellor and of Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> very sharply. The purpose of this was clear: to brand the Federal Republic as a disturber of the peace. He had it in mind to instruct Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> to state clearly at one of the next sessions, that the Delegation of the Federal Republic was participating in the conference as Advisers, that it was prepared to cooperate but that this was being made difficult because of these intemperate attacks. He added that he would like to know the Secretary’s feelings as to whether this would be a good thing to do, as otherwise he would not wish to press the matter.</p>
<p>The Secretary questioned whether this would not be grist to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s mill. If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> felt that he had struck a sensitive nerve by <pb xml:id="pg_729" n="729" facs="0754"/>these attacks, would he not be likely to exploit this further and to increase them? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> suggested that the Four Western Foreign Ministers might discuss this point, and that it would perhaps be appropriate for one of the other Western Foreign Ministers to make a rebuttal and term such attacks distasteful. It was agreed that the Western Foreign Ministers should discuss the matter on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister said he had last week called on <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, who had not yet responded to his visit. If he should not hear from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> this week, he thought he might go to see him again next week, after his return to Germany, and wanted to know whether the Secretary had any objections to his so doing. He said that it would not be difficult for him to do so since the Federal Republic has official relations with the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not like his visits, and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> hates them, which was a good reason for their taking place. The Secretary said he had no objection whatever. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> might pull the trick of having <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> present when <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> arrived. The Foreign Minister said that in this case, he would tell <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that there had obviously been a mistake since he was already busy, and he would ask for another appointment on the following day.</p>

<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> gave me lunch at the Perle du Lac. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> was there when I arrived and also remained for lunch. The early part of the conversation was light with both of them exerting maximum effort to be friendly and agreeable.</p>
<p>A number of points came up, not necessarily in the following sequence.</p>
<p>They both made a routine play for the participation in the conference of the Czechs and the Poles. I said that this was obviously a matter which was not ripe for solution. They laughed and dropped it.</p>
<p>They asked my guess on the duration of the conference and I said that based on the Berlin and last Geneva experience<note n="1" xml:id="d317fn1">For documentation on the Berlin Conference, January 25–February 18, 1954, see <ref target="frus1952-54v07p1"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol. VII, Part 1</ref>, pp. 601 ff. For documentation on the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference, October 27–November 16, 1955, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 1955–1957, vol. V, pp. 537 ff.</note> I thought about three to three and one-half weeks. In reply to my questions, <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> guessed four weeks and <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> three and a half.</p>
<p>They asked me what our ideas were on a solution for Berlin and when were we going to make a proposal. I said that we already had made a proposal and one which seemed entirely logical. They attacked it on usual grounds and pointed out that they had made several suggestions. I asked if they planned to make a formal proposal at the conference. They looked at each other and then <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> said, “That is a matter still to be decided by our Delegation.” They kept asking when the West would be making counter proposals. I said we were awaiting their considered reaction which we hoped would differ substantially from their initial reaction to the Western Peace Plan. They said there was nothing new in it. I pointed out some of the major changes from our 1955 proposals. They asked again about counter proposals and I said we were looking to them as after all it was “their” conference. At no time did they drop any hints or express any overt interest in starting private talks.</p>
<p>The bulk of our luncheon time was used for a discussion of Soviet and United States policy with respect to Germany. I took the offensive by saying that we were frankly bewildered by the Soviets’ pursuit of a policy which to us would almost certainly lead to disaster in ten, twenty or thirty years. They reacted indignantly and accused the United States of seeking to use Germany as the spearhead of a military threat to Russia. I pointed out that our policy for the past decade had been designed to knit the Federal Republic into the fabric of Western Europe. I pointed out that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> by its structure and nature could only operate defensively and that the Russians should be grateful that the United States played a major military role in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> thereby removing any possibility of any future adventurism or independent action by Germany. The <pb xml:id="pg_731" n="731" facs="0756"/>argument was vehement and prolonged with <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> losing his temper on two or three occasions. The conversation, however, ended on an even key.</p>
<p>After saying goodbye <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> followed me out to the car to urge as the most practical way of making progress that we should go over the Soviet piece treaty article by article. He insisted, as both of them had on a number of occasions during the lunch, that they had come to Geneva with a genuine desire to negotiate and to reach agreements. They thought a Summit conference was very important. They expressed doubt as to whether or not we were in the same frame of mind. I assured him that we were but added they would understand that their proposals as presented were totally unacceptable to us.</p>
<p>The net impressions left on me were (1) the Soviets want a Summit conference this summer and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has been instructed to make this possible; (2) they believe our statements that without some progress at the Foreign Ministers Conference there will be no Summit; and (3) they are not themselves sure in what area the requisite progress can be achieved.<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2"><persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> also discussed <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>’s joining the U.S. Delegation and air transit routes to Moscow.

Main idea behind Soviet proposal Germany should be free foreign troops and bases. However, since differing opinions on this, Soviets prepared, as already announced, accept provision each Germany should for certain period <pb xml:id="pg_733" n="733" facs="0758"/>time continue adhere existing military alliances.

<p>5) Soviet attitude elections clear and incorrect attempt find inconsistencies or contradictions Soviet statements past and present.

<p>6) <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> had stated peace treaty can only be signed with all-German Government.

<p>9) Totally untrue claim Soviet Union not interested European security, which however should not be linked to preliminary solution number European problems. Objected putting on same footing problems not on same plane.</p>
<p>10) <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> completely unjustified claiming Soviet proposals attempt impose “diktat” Germany; on contrary, Soviets object Western powers attempt impose diktat.</p>
<p>11) <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had claimed no problem exists either peace treaty or Berlin. If this true what are we doing here? Problem peace treaty exists and this fault not Soviet Union but Hitlerite Germany.</p>
<p>12) <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> expressed surprise Soviet rejection Western plan and said this totally unexpected but why should West be surprised since, even before proposals officially received, Soviets knew about general approach and had expressed its position.</p>

<head>319. Letter From the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs (<persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName>) to the Representative to the United Nations (<persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>)<note n="0" xml:id="d319fn0" type="source">Source: Department of State, UNA Files: Lot 61 D 91, Berlin. Personal and Confidential.</note></head>
<dateline><placeName>Geneva</placeName>, <date when="1959-05-20">May 20, 1959</date>.</dateline>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Cabot</persName>: While there isn’t a great deal to report from here in addition to what you have read in the press, I thought you might like to have some first-hand reactions.</p>
<p>At the moment it looks as though both sides were pretty well dug in. We are in the process of explaining in detail our Western Peace Plan, while the Russians will no doubt continue to debate the merits of their proposal. Rumors are flying thick and fast that the Western Powers are ready to break open their package plan in order to see whether the Russians might take a portion of it. We are holding to the line, however, that the comprehensive plan which we have put in is the only logical and equitable solution to the German problem.</p>
<p>Generally the Russians are doing their best to leave the impression that they have come here in a friendly and cooperative spirit and are really interested in coming to an agreement. Indeed, at a dinner the other night <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had sent him to Geneva for that purpose. Just what kind of an agreement they have in mind is certainly not clear up to this point.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_735" n="735" facs="0760"/>
<p>My own conviction is that they will do their best to get enough of an agreement to justify a Summit conference. No doubt they will do their best to get the bare minimum. It is even possible that they will argue that some kind of agreement on the nuclear testing matter should suffice for going to the Summit.</p>
<p>We are all very pleased with the way Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> is handling his new job. He always appears relaxed and goes about his business with a certain air of assurance. He apparently does his homework for he always seems well briefed. And, I must say, he has made quite a hit with the people here in Geneva as a friendly, understanding individual who knows what he is about.</p>
<p>I went to a small dinner at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s house the other night with the Secretary. I remarked to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> that I did not know very much about the Russian language. Since I had heard the word “Nyet” so very much, I did recognize that. He laughed and replied that he hoped we would be hearing the word “yes” a great deal more in the future.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I am attempting to do a few things in connection with the Specialized Agencies and our Mission here in Geneva. As you know, this place is getting to be an international center, second only in importance to New York. This means that we must do what we can to strengthen the mission so it will be equipped to handle numerous conferences of various kinds.</p>
<p>I am also taking the opportunity to visit the Specialized Agencies in the area and to demonstrate in every way I can our interest in the work of these organizations.</p>
<p>In the first nine days of the conference I have heard very little about the United Nations. If the time should arrive when we get into any detailed discussion of the Berlin question, it is probable that various U.N. contributions will be examined. On the other hand, I do think it is a helpful experience for me to be here in a number of ways, and it is probably good to have someone on the Delegation who will keep the interests of the U.N. in mind.</p>
<p>If any additional thoughts occur to you in connection with this problem, or if you have anything you would like to have me do while I am here, please don’t hesitate to let me know.</p>
<p>With warm personal regards, I am</p>
<p>Cordially yours,</p>

<p rend="center">FULL DELEGATION MEETING</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Note on “Subversive” U.S. Radio in Berlin</p>
<p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that the Russians yesterday delivered a note<note n="1" xml:id="d320fn1">A translation of this note was transmitted in telegram 2331 from Moscow, May 20. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 962A.40/5–2059)</note> to Embassy Moscow alleging U.S. operation of a radio station in Berlin sending “subversive” broadcasts to the Soviet Union. He commented that it was in general moderately worded. The Secretary asked that the facts be ascertained regarding the Soviet allegation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> expressed the opinion that the activities alleged in the note were not in fact going on at this time.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Conference Tactics</p>
<p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> explained that Western speaking assignments for the next two days call for statements by the Secretary on security, by <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> on the confederation concept, by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> on reunification, and by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> on Berlin. It is hoped that these four speeches will refocus the Conference discussion on the Western Peace Plan. There was agreement that it would be desirable for the Secretary not to make his statement on security until Friday by which time State and Defense would have had an opportunity to work out an agreed position. The Secretary inquired whether it would be desirable to make a reply to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s suggestion that the Soviet draft peace treaty be taken article by article,<note n="2" xml:id="d320fn2"><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made this suggestion at the seventh session on May 19; see <ref target="#d314">Document 314</ref>.</note> and thought we should say something to take the initiative away from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that yesterday <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> had urged to him that the Soviet draft be reviewed article by article.<note n="3" xml:id="d320fn3">See <ref target="#d317">Document 317</ref>.</note> The Secretary made it clear that the West should not talk about a peace treaty until we get agreement on the principle of German reunification. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> suggested that the West not force the issue but go ahead with the elaboration of our own proposals; Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> continued that at the end of this week it would be important to decide where we go from here. The Secretary noted that the Western Four were meeting here today and will meet again on Monday to plan for the third week’s work.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_737" n="737" facs="0762"/>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> wondered whether it would be desirable for the West to table a paper on an interim solution for Berlin. The Secretary thought that we might do so in the case of Berlin but that we should leave to the Soviets the tabling of proposals on other subjects.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Criticism of West Germans</p>
<p>3. The Secretary said that it was desirable for the West to rebuke the Russians for the abusive language they have been using about the West Germans. He indicated that we should have material available to show that the East Germans are guilty of the charges the Russians have been making against the West Germans. In this connection Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FEL1">Freers</persName> pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>’s speech on Sunday<note n="4" xml:id="d320fn4">A summary of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>’s speech was transmitted in telegram 976 from Berlin, May 20. (Department of State, Central Files, 110.11–HE/5–2059)</note> in Rostock contained a passage on Soviet-<gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> plans for communization of West Germany which had been omitted from the press accounts. He suggested that this could be exploited in our refutation of attacks on the West Germans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> thought that one of the most effective refutations of German remarks yesterday would be to get to the press the communization of West Germany section of <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName>’s speech. The Secretary indicated that he thought this should be done at once.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Press Reaction to Conference</p>
<p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said that there is a great deal of press interest in the dinner the Secretary is giving tonight. The Secretary said that the line to take was that it was simply a courtesy dinner.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> noted the press coverage of the Conference is declining in volume and interest and that the press is expressing the hope that secret sessions will soon be held which will produce new developments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> noted that the Soviet briefing officer had praised the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s approach to the conference and indirectly attacked the French for an unrealistic attitude. The Soviet briefer also said that the Soviets are not in favor of secret meetings, claiming that they have nothing to hide.</p>

<p>[Here follow a paragraph listing the participants at the meeting and agenda items 1–4.]</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">5. The Geneva Conference</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> stated that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had agreed to make any pertinent observations he might have on developments at the Foreign Ministers Conference in Geneva.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observed that all he really wanted to say was that what had been happening at the Conference had been fully reported in the public press and there was practically nothing of any significance which was not known publicly. He added that there was the impression in the State Department that we had got past the preliminary hurdles at Geneva more rapidly than had originally been thought possible. On the other hand, in the course of the last week we had run into the expected Soviet stone wall. Perhaps, thought Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, next week would provide signs of more significant negotiations especially with respect to Berlin. If so, these negotiations would probably be private in character. Meanwhile, the U.K. had been playing very good ball with the U.S.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that we had had some difficulty with the very large number of representatives of the press in Geneva. In the absence of any very significant real news, the reporters had been reduced to manufacturing stories from very flimsy evidence.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> added the thought that there had been a couple of fairly significant developments at the private dinner meeting of the Foreign Ministers.<note n="1" xml:id="d321fn1">See <ref target="#d304">Document 304</ref>.</note> In the first place, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> had informed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the U.S. would never consent to a Summit Meeting under threat. Secondly, there had been a flop in the matter of the nuclear test negotiations. The sudden hope of progress in this area had ended abruptly almost as soon as it had been born. If the Soviets do not retreat from the position recently taken by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">For text of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s letter to the President, May 14, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents</hi>, 1959, pp. 1311–1313.</note> who had stated a willingness to study only high altitude test suspension, the prospects for any real agreement seemed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> to be very slim.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_739" n="739" facs="0764"/>
<p>The Vice President inquired whether Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> meant to convey that the Soviets would not agree to the suggestions on test suspension made in the President’s recent letter to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d321fn3">For text of this letter, dated May 5, see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., pp. 1309–1310.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that they would not agree to these suggestions.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> stated that the visit of two reliable American individuals recently to Moscow had eventuated in a visit with <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> who had informed these individuals that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had liked the President’s letter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> confessed that he could not estimate the significance of this report.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out one other interesting piece of intelligence. Apparently, he said, the Soviets have extended the lease of their villa in Geneva from the 8th of June until the 8th of July.</p>

Recalling previous <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s reference to fact United States began as confederation, <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> pointed out American confederation based fundamental principles of liberty, democracy, and human rights held in common by all members, in contrast to which Soviets propose confederation between free democratic Federal Republic and tyrannical, oppressive <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> said impossible confederate “system of freedom with system of bondage.” <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> also mentioned German experience with 19th century confederation, which, however, had proved extremely weak and inadequate. German history therefore regarded that form of government as reactionary.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> alleged confederation involving opposite political ideas would result in organization incapable of action, adding that indeed confederation concept contained inherent veto right each member re common institutions. Pointed out unsatisfactory recent experience such veto principle, including Control Council Germany and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council. Suggested aim confederation proposal really to paralyze Federal Republic while not permitting similar paralysis <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Also attacked parity idea asking whether votes 52,000,000 people on par with those 17,000,000. Therefore concluded confederation proposal will not contribute to German unification but to its postponement and prevention, and moreover to political paralysis Federal Republic.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> closed by expressing hope certain <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> statements yesterday indicative positive ideas. He mentioned: Soviet suggestion two parts Germany might not have to withdraw existing defense pacts suggests Soviets now recognize German right in accordance Article 51 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> <pb xml:id="pg_741" n="741" facs="0766"/>Charter free decide membership regional defense arrangements; Soviet intention avoid imposing economic restrictions on future Germany welcomed if this means no Soviet objections membership in communities European economic integration; and hope that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> statement yesterday meant does not regard Federal Republic political parties as “revanchist.” Finally <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> warned that prospects resolving East-West differences still uncertain until Soviets change Article 2 treaty draft providing for negotiating with “two existing German states.”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> then defended Soviet Peace Treaty proposal along established lines with particular reference to its urgency and benefits, militarism Western Germany, etc.<note n="4" xml:id="d322fn4">For text of <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName>’ statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/A/3, June 4, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 570–573 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 193–196.</note> Warned that division of Germany would deepen and unification become more difficult unless treaty accomplished, and claimed existing two German states constitute juridical successors former German Reich.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Problems Relating to Foreign Ministers’ Meeting</item>
</list>
<p>Both before and during dinner there was no general conversation, most of the talk being conducted in groups of two and three and in so far as I observed on a social rather than a serious basis.</p>
<p>After rising from the table at 9:45 and following coffee which most drank on their feet, the entire party ranged in a semicircle around the two love seats on which were seated the Secretary with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> respectively. The conversation thereafter until about 10:55 when the guests left was substantially confined to the four Foreign Ministers with an occasional interjection by <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> and Rumbold and intervention by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>.</p>
<p>The subject of Czech-Polish participation first came up, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> introducing it by saying that he had discussed the subject exhaustively for an hour during dinner with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> but that neither had been able to convince the other. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> clung tenaciously to his usual arguments and was rebutted by all three Foreign Ministers with equal vigor in the use of past arguments. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> finally dropped the subject without, however, appearing unduly disturbed.</p>
<p>The question then turned to possible areas of agreement, with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> seeking to pin Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> down to the propositions that the <pb xml:id="pg_743" n="743" facs="0768"/>Soviet Union agree that Germany should be reunified and that it should be done by free elections. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> countered repeatedly by saying that the Soviet Union was “not against” reunification nor “against” free elections but that both these matters were exclusively for the two German states to work out.</p>
<p>This led to a warm discussion of the nature of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> maintaining that it was propped up by Russian bayonets and that its leaders could not conceivably be considered to represent the German people living in the Eastern Zone.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> countered with an attack on the atomic arming of the Federal Republic and appeared totally unimpressed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>’s pointing out that under United States law the warheads had to remain in United States custody. This discussion likewise was inconclusive.</p>
<p>Both during his arguments for Czech-Polish participation and toward the end of the evening <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> openly invited counter proposals from the West and the establishment of private talks, possibly even with a smaller group outside the Palais.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">Conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName></p>
<p>1. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> mentioned three subjects he had discussed last night with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at the Secretary’s dinner.<note n="1" xml:id="d324fn1">See <ref target="#d323">Document 323</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> spoke of Soviet concern about German rearmament, especially weapons of great destructive power. On disarmament, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> said he had noted to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that unless there were mutual trust there would be little progress. When <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he felt it was necessary for someone to break the circle of mistrust, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> suggested that the Russians make the first move. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicated preoccupation with U.S. bases which he said showed aggressive U.S. intent against the Soviet Union. The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> whether <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had developed the discussion on disarmament. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> added that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had indicated that he was not opposed to inspections with limits. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought that of the three subjects discussed, disarmament was the most likely field for further discussion with the Russians.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Conference Tactics</p>
<p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that there are two speeches scheduled for today, one by the Secretary on the security aspects of the Western Plan and one by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> on Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he thought we should not hand out the Secretary’s speech to other Western delegations very much in advance of the time of delivery to avoid last minute “nit-picks”.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Site of German Presidential Election</p>
<p>3. The Secretary said we should make proposals at the meeting of the four Western Foreign Ministers today in respect to the proposed holding of the German presidential election in West Berlin. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> thought it should not be held in Berlin but that the West should not so go on record. In response to the Secretary’s inquiry, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> said that the British share our views.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Charges of West German Militarism</p>
<p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> said that he thought it important for us to refute East German and Soviet charges that West Germany has a highly developed military apparatus. In reply to an inquiry by the Secretary, Mr. Bundy said that the figures of Soviet troops in East Germany could be made public without compromising sources. The Secretary asked that a contrast should be drawn up on troop strengths in West and East Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> thought that since Western military strength in West Germany and Soviet troop strength in East Germany would generally balance out, the contrast should be confined to West German and East German forces.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_745" n="745" facs="0770"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Nuclear Test Talks</p>
<p>5. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> reported that Tsarapkin told him yesterday<note n="2" xml:id="d324fn2">No further record of this conversation has been found.</note> that we must hurry to reach agreement since the French are about to set off a nuclear explosion. The Secretary noted that during his talk with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> yesterday<note n="3" xml:id="d324fn3">A brief memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> at 3 p.m. on May 21, US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/50, at which this agreement was reached, is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1338.</note> agreement had been reached that (1) the Soviets would have to accept our memorandum on the terms of reference for a meeting of the technical representatives or there would be no further steps to arrange a meeting before the conference reconvenes; and (2) that progress in the test suspension talks alone would not be justification for holding a Summit meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> said that Tsarapkin seems to be extremely eager to conclude a test suspension agreement. The Secretary observed that we have an ally in Tsarapkin in our efforts to keep the test talks out of the Foreign Ministers’ Conference.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Nuclear Cooperation with France</p>
<p>6. The Secretary cited a Department telegram (<gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 92)<note n="4" xml:id="d324fn4">Dated May 20. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1319)</note> suggesting that he raise with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> the possibility of future nuclear cooperation with France. The Department wants to make sure the French understand that our legal requirement for receiving restricted data, namely, “substantial progress in weapons development,” is not fulfilled simply by exploding one bomb. He indicated that we should think over our nuclear cooperation policy toward France.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Separability of Western Peace Plan</p>
<p>7. The Secretary said he thought that the only separable parts of the Peace Plan were Berlin and disarmament. If some progress were made on disarmament, this might be enough to justify a Summit meeting. Regarding Berlin, if we could isolate areas of agreement and disagreement, this might be a suitable subject for discussion at the Summit. In connection with Berlin, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> mentioned that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> is preparing two papers on our Berlin proposals which will spell out how they will work in the event we should be asked to do so by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Private Talks with the Russians</p>
<p>8. The Secretary indicated that since we do not seem to be able to make any progress at the Conference table, we would have to consider private sessions. How to set up these talks is, he said, a major procedural <pb xml:id="pg_746" n="746" facs="0771"/>question which would have to be discussed by the four Western Foreign Ministers. He noted that one difficulty was that the Soviets are not keen on formalizing informal discussions.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">High Altitude Flights in Berlin Corridor</p>
<p>9. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> called attention to a telegram from the Department, being a draft reply to the Soviet note of April 29 on high altitude flights in the Berlin corridor.<note n="5" xml:id="d324fn5">The draft note was transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 96, May 21. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>) The note under reference was delivered to the Embassy in Moscow on April 28 and a translation transmitted in telegram 2160 from Moscow, April 29. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 762B.5411/4–1959)</note> The draft essentially restates our position as contained, in an earlier note. After some discussion, the Secretary thought we would have to study the matter carefully before commenting on the proposed reply.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Press Reaction to Conference</p>
<p>10. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said he thought that the Secretary’s brief rebuttal statement at the conclusion of Thursday’s session had worked very well, receiving wide coverage both here and in the States. He called attention to an editorial in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> today in support of the Western Plan which he thought was evidence that we had successfully got the plan across to the public. He noted that <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> is planning a campaign to spread information about the Western Plan.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Secretary’s Dinner for Foreign Ministers</p>
<p>11. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> reported that the French, in briefing the press on the Secretary’s dinner for the Foreign Ministers on Thursday, had said that there was a recapitulation of Conference discussions at the dinner. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said that Baraduc had explained to him that <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said he saw no harm in saying this to the press. It was noted that the French had violated the agreement that the press would only be told that the dinner was purely a courtesy affair.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Views of Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> on Berlin</p>
<p>12. The Secretary said he thought it would be important to keep posted on the views of Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> on Berlin and to stay in close contact with him.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s Request to go to Communist China</p>
<p>13. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName>, after meeting earlier with the Secretary, stated that we intend to issue Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> a passport valid for travel to Communist China. He said that we agree with the Department that <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> is a bona fide newsman and thus comes within present U.S. <pb xml:id="pg_747" n="747" facs="0772"/>policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> said that the phrasing of the press release on the matter was very important and should be carefully worded.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Approaches by Unrecognized Governments</p>
<p>14. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> noted that yesterday he had been approached by a representative of the Indonesian rebel government and by the Counselor of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> office in Geneva.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Problems Relating to the Conference</item>
</list>
<p>The meeting opened with an account by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> of the conversation which he had just concluded with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. He said <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had noted that not much progress was being made at the conference and that the two sides seemed far apart. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had agreed and pointed out that the Western Powers and the Soviets seemed to be talking about two different things. Both sides knew that the other side could not accept its proposals. He had indicated that he could not see any use continuing with a discussion of this kind, and if the conversations were to go on some different basis must be found. All the Western Powers asked was peace in Europe, free of incidents or threats of war. He had then said to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that, if he had any worries from this point of view, he should let the Western powers know and they could discuss it. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> then had mentioned the proposed Western statements for this afternoon and had asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> what he thought would happen next week. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had added that if he had any ideas, we would be prepared to discuss them in any convenient forum. To this <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had merely responded that the Soviets attached no importance to the forum but were prepared for discussions anywhere. Neither went further. During the conversation <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> placed great stress on German militarism with particular reference to the atomic armament of the Federal Republic. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he had tried to explain that tactical rather than strategic weapons were involved and that all the warheads remained in American hands. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had replied that, while this might be true, how could one be sure that it would continue to be the case in the future. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> commented that he had the impression that the question of the installation or non-installation of strategic weapons in the Federal Republic was an important matter to the Soviets.</p>
<p>In response to the Secretary’s query, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that he also had the impression that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was not willing to ask for a new type of meeting between the Foreign Ministers but was willing to accept Western proposals for different kinds of meetings.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he assumed that none of the Western Foreign Ministers would make any further reference to specific Articles of the Soviet peace treaty in their discussions. It seemed that this was going to be a waiting game from here on out, and that individual discussions with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would provide the best hope of making any progress. Perhaps an effort should be made to get <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to talk about what he was willing to accept in our peace plan. If the Western powers attempted to have formal restricted meetings with him, even if on a small scale, the same problem of the East German advisers would arise.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that he had the impression from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the latter did not want to use one of the formal rooms in the Palais for restricted <pb xml:id="pg_749" n="749" facs="0774"/>meetings of the Four, but might be willing to meet in one of the private offices. He would probably prefer to come to one of the private villas. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> commented that it would probably be best to have private meetings in one of the villas rather than at the Palais.</p>
<p>The Secretary observed that, from conversations among ourselves, it was pretty well agreed that only two subjects sooner or later might evolve as a basis for some agreement: Berlin and disarmament. The immediate problem was one of tactics—how not to show too much eagerness. The question to be considered is how long the waiting game should go on. Should we wait for some move from the Soviets or attempt at some point to take the initiative? Whatever we said on Berlin, of course, must be understood to be within the framework of an interim arrangement pending eventual reunification of Germany.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said his main concern was to avoid giving any impetus to the “disengagers” in the United Kingdom. Undue protraction of the Geneva Conference would strengthen such forces. Therefore he could not favor dragging things out too long.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> noted he was inclined to think it too early to raise the Berlin issue in quest of some modus vivendi. Public opinion and the Soviets would interpret this as meaning that the West had dropped its entire Peace Plan.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> observed there was some truth in this. Perhaps the Western Powers should try to get <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to talk about those elements which he found constructive in the Peace Plan.</p>
<p>The Secretary commented that <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s statement this afternoon would draw out <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s negative views on the Berlin proposals in the Peace Plan.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said it would probably be a good idea to recess formal meetings for a day or two. On Monday <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will presumably wish to reply to the Western statements this afternoon. What is required is a little more organization of the private talks; they should not merely consist of sitting around on sofas after a bountiful dinner.</p>
<p>After a brief noting of engagements for next week, it developed that the only scheduled social meetings with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> were <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s invitation to have lunch with him on Monday and the invitation extended to all three Western Foreign Ministers to have dinner with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>If there were going to be a recess for a couple of days, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then continued, the press should be adequately prepared. The point might be made that this was nothing abnormal, that daily meetings throughout the conference should not be expected. Western press officers might start hinting at this tonight.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_750" n="750" facs="0775"/>
<p>The Secretary pointed out that he might have to go home for a few days, and might have to request a recess of the conference to enable this. He would take the opportunity to mention this possibility to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
<p>It was agreed that the Western Foreign Ministers should meet before lunch on Monday (Rumbold would represent <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, who would not be returning to Geneva until 1:30). This would be in keeping with the general idea that the Western Foreign Ministers would attempt to concert their line prior to any individual meetings with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. It was also agreed that they would meet at 3:00 p.m. before the plenary session on Monday, and that the Coordinating Group would meet once before Monday to discuss tactics for next week, giving particular consideration to the question of how long the Western Powers should wait before taking the initiative.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> at this point reported briefly on the Coordinating Group meeting which had taken place earlier in the morning.<note n="1" xml:id="d325fn1">The Coordinating Group, led by <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LJ1">Laloy</persName>, Rumbold, and <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>, met at 10:30 a.m. A memorandum of their conversation, US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/41, is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1338.</note> He said it had been thought that it would be good to try to introduce a more colloquial style into the meetings next week. It might likewise be desirable if, in a private conversation, one of the Western Foreign Ministers raised the question of a possible termination date for the conference. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he had some apprehensions about attempting to fix a date for ending the conference. This would be sure to leak out and the West would be blamed for pressing for a premature end of the conference. The Secretary mentioned that there were certain little signs that the Soviets envisaged a somewhat lengthy conference. For example, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had, in discussing the nuclear test question, asked that a report be submitted to the Foreign Ministers. Since this could not be accomplished before June 8, the implication was obvious. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that there was no question in his mind but that the conference was going to last a while yet. He should say two weeks.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said he had a matter to raise on a confidential basis. The presidential elections were due to be held in Germany on July 1. Last fall, prior to the receipt of the Soviet note on Berlin,<note n="2" xml:id="d325fn2">See <ref target="#d72">Document 72</ref>.</note> the president of the Bundestag had agreed to call the Federal Assembly (which elects the Federal President) in Berlin as had been done for the previous presidential elections. Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> now had some doubt as to whether it was desirable to hold the meeting of the Federal Assembly in Berlin under present circumstances. He felt that such action might be construed as provocative, and would appreciate the views of the other Western Foreign Ministers. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said he would see the Chancellor <pb xml:id="pg_751" n="751" facs="0776"/>tomorrow and convey to him these views. If the decision were in the negative the fact that the Western Foreign Ministers had so advised would of course not be given as a reason for the decision against holding the meeting of the Federal Assembly in Berlin.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that he would agree that, if it could be so arranged as to not involve the Western Foreign Ministers, it would be preferable to call the Federal Assembly in Bonn rather than in Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> expressed the same view, and mentioned he had already said the same during his recent visit to Bonn.<note n="3" xml:id="d325fn3">See <ref target="#d287">Document 287</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked what reason could be given for the change. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said that the Bundestag President could simply say that it was a matter of simplifying procedures and of other practical reasons such as avoiding the longer trip for the members of the Assembly. Everyone would know the real reason, of course. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then said that he likewise felt it would be better to avoid having the Assembly meet in Berlin.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said that it was clear the Western Foreign Ministers all proceeded from the assumption that the conference would have no final results, but as the Secretary had indicated, it was necessary to establish conditions for a Summit meeting. These conditions presumably should be some arrangement on Berlin and some arrangement on disarmament. How must such a Berlin arrangement work? He was of the opinion that, if the West were to be satisfied with a standstill, that is, a Soviet agreement to take no unilateral action before or during the Summit meeting, the Soviets could claim that this in effect authorized them to take such action if the Summit failed. He wondered whether the Allies should not insist on an unqualified acknowledgement of their right to stay in Berlin as a condition for going to the Summit. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said the German Foreign Minister had raised an important point, and the Western Foreign Ministers should discuss this early next week. It seemed partly a matter of presentation. The West must, of course, avoid giving any implied authority to the Soviets to change the situation in Berlin.</p>

<item>The President</item>
<item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName></item>
<item>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName></item>
<item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName></item>
</list>
<p>From the conversation it appeared that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s primary purpose was to convince the President of the usefulness of a Summit meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> spoke extensively of his talks with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and indicated his belief that there was a possibility of making progress through Summit negotiations with him. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> also indicated his belief that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was now the absolute and sole ruler in the Soviet Union. He cited as an instance of this belief the fact that when it become known that he was going to see <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> none of the other top leaders of the Soviet Union would discuss any subject with him which they thought might conceivably be the subject of a later conversation between him and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. This indicated very clearly that none of them wished to have the slightest possible difference of opinion with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> commented on the unusual relationship between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> in which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> treated <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> as sort of a jester. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> used the words “a Sancho Panza”. But nevertheless, it was clear that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had a great deal of influence with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> did not at any time say anything about holding a Summit conference under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> auspices.</p>
<p>Regarding the German situation, <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> said that he had gathered from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that Berlin was not really of major importance to the Soviets but what was of supreme importance to them was the status of East Germany. Regarding a possible use of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d326fn1">See <ref target="#d246fn2">footnote 2, <ref target="#d246">Document 246</ref></ref>.</note> that he had no fixed ideas as to how this could be done and said that since he had accepted the principle of such a connection he thought it was up to the Western powers to indicate whether and how they would like this accomplished.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_753" n="753" facs="0778"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> thinks that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> does not consider the possibility of the use of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in Berlin in some form as a Soviet proposal, but rather as a Soviet concession to the West to make some sort of different regime more palatable.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> said that the Soviets were deeply influenced in their attitude toward Germany by their belief that no one, except possibly the United States, really desired the reunification of Germany. This was a cardinal tenet of their belief and was the reason they treat the subject of unification in such a cavalier fashion.</p>
<p>The major substantive comment by the President was a statement that while he does not believe in threats, and had never talked of United States or Western military power himself, he was determined to stand absolutely firm wherever he felt that we were fundamentally in the right. He said he was convinced that to show weakness in such situations would be very dangerous as it would only serve to encourage the Soviet appetite and thus the threat of future war. The President also expressed his strong belief in increased trade and increased exchanges of all sorts as a useful mechanism for reducing tensions and increasing Soviet understanding of Western ways of life.</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>I have just sent a brief summary wire to the Department covering our position at the present moment with the special request that it be forwarded to you. We have practically reached the end of the open session period with set speeches outlining our positions or rejecting those of the other side. I feel the only possible progress hereafter can be made through types of individual or informal four-power conferences such as I outlined in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 105.<note n="1" xml:id="d328fn1">See the source note, <ref target="#d325">Document 325</ref>.</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_755" n="755" facs="0780"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> shows very little sign of giving in and all indications point to his expecting long-drawn-out discussions. I hope next week will give a glimmer of light, but feel patience must still be the watchword.</p>
<p>It must be terribly exasperating to you to read of our political exchanges, but this seems an inevitable part of negotiations such as these. Allied unity is holding firm and fewer stories are being circulated regarding divergence of views in the Allied camp.</p>
<p>I expect to be an expert Russian scholar before the end of the conference. Faithfully. Signed: Chris.”</p>

</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> asked me to dinner last night and it quickly became evident that his purpose was to indicate that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would like to have a conversation alone with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> either at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s villa or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s. He was careful not specifically to ask for an appointment but said this would be the only way to get on with the Conference, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would be in Geneva over the weekend, and that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> was interested I need only call Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName>.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was spent in a long philosophical discussion, the highlights of which follow: <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> outlined the intense desire <pb xml:id="pg_756" n="756" facs="0781"/>of the Soviet Government for peace and an opportunity to build up their country, which he admitted would take longer than their slogans indicated. He asked me what I thought was the principal obstacle to improved United States-Soviet relations. I replied that I thought the root of the trouble lay in the ideology of international communism. Although they talked about coexistence they did not believe in it except as a temporary expedient. They believed in the inevitable struggle between the two systems and that eventually communism had to triumph. Their almost religious belief in their ideology led to complications and conflict in our relations. I pointed out, for example, that if East Germany did not have a communist regime, we could probably settle the German question very quickly.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> disputed some of my arguments but on the question of conflict between the systems remarked that we could not escape history by which he meant that communism was bound to win.</p>
<p>In discussing the German problem, <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> mentioned the special sensitivity of the Russians on this question because of their experience during the last two wars. He said, however, that if the United States and the Soviet Union could get together, there would be no difficulty in solving the German problem. Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union had any reason to fear Germany in itself. The Soviets were afraid, however, that Germany acting as the spearhead would drag the United States into conflict with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>When <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> spoke of the United States and Soviet Union getting together, I said it seemed to me that even Soviets who had lived in the United States failed to understand that under our system of government, the President could not engage in big “deals”. The President could lead his country within certain limits but Congress and public opinion had to be taken into account and imposed very definite limitations upon his actions. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was a realist and he was sure that he understood this.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> made many references to the bitter attitude of the American press toward the Soviet Union. Speaking of Africa, he said he had to laugh when he read accounts in American papers about the great Soviet influence there. He said he knew that such influence was virtually non-existent.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> referred many times in the conversation to the great impression which the economic strength of the United States had made upon Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> and himself during their trip. He also expressed their great pleasure at the visit of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. He said he was convinced that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> was a “good” man and he was optimistic that we could work out our problems successfully.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_757" n="757" facs="0782"/>
<p>At one time Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> asked me if I thought it was possible for a radical non-peaceloving man to come to power in the United States. I gathered he had in mind someone like Hitler. I assured him that this was not possible but that even if it happened, it could make little difference in our foreign policy because of our system of checks and balances.</p>

<item>Next steps in conference</item>
</list>
<p rend="center">MERCHANT FORECAST</p>
<p>In contemplating where we go from here we take the following as assumptions:</p>
<list>
<item>1) The Soviets will pay a price of some sort for the Summit meeting (because <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wants it and because he believes the United States is serious when it says some justifying progress will have to be made in the Foreign Ministers meeting).</item>
<item>2) No agreement with the Soviets is possible on either the Soviet draft treaty or the reunification of Germany for the foreseeable future.</item>
<item>3) Any divorce of security provisions from the reunification process in Western Plan is unacceptable.</item>
<item>4) Progress in the nuclear test negotiations would not in itself be acceptable to the West as a Soviet ticket of admission to the Summit.</item>
</list>
<p>Accepting these four assumptions it seems to us that the area of possible progress in this conference is confined to the following:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_759" n="759" facs="0784"/>
<list>
<item>1) Berlin</item>
<item>2) Global disarmament</item>
<item>3) Agreement on time, place and agenda for a Summit meeting.</item>
</list>
<p>Our first cut at framing a position (which if approved by you would then require the agreement of our three allies) is the following:</p>
<p>1) With respect to Berlin, what we desire is (a) an acknowledgment by the Soviet Union that we are rightfully in occupation in Berlin and are entitled to unrestricted access thereto (including German civilian access), plus (b) some form of assurance by the Soviet Union that it will not attempt to do something (such as entering into a separate peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>) in an effort to change the status quo respecting Berlin. We have considered some form of declaration or statement by the USSR that in any future treaty or arrangement between the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the USSR, to which the Western Powers are not parties, explicit provision will be made (e.g. through designation of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel as agents, or otherwise) for continued exercise of the above-mentioned rights of the Western Powers, plus free and unrestricted access of German civilians to Berlin. We are not in favor of this suggestion, upon further consideration, upon the ground that it would be tantamount to an invitation to the USSR to enter into a separate peace treaty or arrangement with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. We have drafted various forms of an agreement or declaration by the USSR giving guarantees by the USSR as stated above, but all of them are subject to the compelling objection that they amount to a total capitulation by the USSR as respects Berlin, without any compensating advantages to the USSR save a Summit meeting. This, in our view, constitutes an unrealistic evaluation of what the Soviet Union is prepared to pay for a Summit meeting, even assuming that it wants one. In our view, therefore, the best practicable approach to this problem would be an indirect one, namely, to formulate an agenda item for the Summit which will, in and of itself, constitute a guarantee containing the two elements of our desideratum. Accordingly, it is suggested that at an appropriate time (to be determined by agreement among the three Western Powers), we suggest a Summit agenda item along the following lines:</p>
<list><item>“Greater Berlin, access thereto, and the special responsibilities of the Four Powers with respect to Greater Berlin, and the methods through which they shall be carried out.”
</item></list><p>The foregoing should be coupled with a joint communiqué—along the lines of an implicit standstill agreement—as follows:</p>
<list><item>“The Foreign Ministers reviewed the problems of Berlin. They agreed that this subject was one which could be referred to a meeting of the Heads of Government, and that pending such a meeting, none of the Four Powers would take any action designed to alter existing rights of occupation in Berlin and procedures for access thereto as they existed in April 1959”.
</item></list>
<pb xml:id="pg_760" n="760" facs="0785"/>
<p>The above suggestion would afford protection to our rights and their exercise until the Summit meeting, but not thereafter, although it contains no admission that action thereafter would be legal or effective. If we desire to obviate this difficulty, we might phrase the communiqué in terms of a set period of time (e.g. two or five years) or (unrealistically) until the reunification of Germany or agreement among the Four Powers.</p>
<p>In connection with any “standstill” proposal such as the foregoing, we should foresee and have an answer to a Soviet inquiry whether it is our intention that the “standstill” be across the board. They will probably raise in this connection the installation of atomic weapons in Germany and the build-up of German armed forces.</p>
<p>2) Reach agreement with the Soviets to recommend to the Heads of Government the resumption of discussions on global disarmament, including surprise attack, in a forum or forums to be determined by the Heads of Government.</p>
<p>3) Reach agreement with the Soviets on the time and place of a meeting of the four Heads of Government (no German advisers, no other participants). This might be, for example, August 10 at Geneva. The agreed agenda should be as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>a) Global disarmament.</item>
<item>b) Greater Berlin, access thereto, and the special responsibilities of the Four Powers with respect to Greater Berlin, and the methods through which they shall be carried out.</item>
<item>c) Nuclear testing.</item>
<item>d) Consideration of a catalog of agreed and disagreed essential points relating to the reunification of Germany, measures of European security and the negotiation of a peace treaty with Germany. (In the consideration of this item at the Summit it might be proposed that there be established a Four Power body with German advisers attached for the continuing examination of these points of difference with a view to narrowing them.)</item>
<item>e) Other business.</item>
</list>
<p>The United States should also seek to add to the agenda an item on the plight of captive peoples in Eastern Europe and an item providing for the discussion of the activities of international communism (it can be expected that the Soviets will reject these). It is also to be expected that the French will propose some grandiose scheme for multilateral contribution to a fund in aid of the under developed areas of the world (the United States should reject such an item).</p>
<p>Finally there should be explicit agreement that any Head of Government would have the right to raise at the Summit meeting any subject he desired to have discussed under the agenda heading of “other business”.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">Conference Tactics</p>
<p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that the Secretary is the only one of the four Western Foreign Ministers who will make a statement today. He added that it is considered important to get this statement, which is on Berlin, on the record before the recess.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s Wish to Travel on the Secretary’s Plane</p>
<p>2. The Secretary noted that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, after refusing our offer of one seat on the Secretary’s plane for the trip to Washington, is trying to get his own accommodations to Washington to attend Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ funeral. The Secretary said it was important for the press to understand that we had offered <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> one seat on the plane on the same basis as the other Foreign Ministers. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> thought that our handling the matter in the press should be such as to avoid any possibility that it. might be built up as an aspect of the cold war.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s Charges of Western Buildup in Berlin</p>
<p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> called attention to a telegram from Bonn<note n="1" xml:id="d334fn1">Telegram 2650 from Bonn, May 25. (Ibid., Central Files, 396.1–GE/5–2559)</note> reporting a conversation between the German Ambassador in Moscow and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> claimed that we had violated the understanding not to change the status quo in Berlin during <pb xml:id="pg_764" n="764" facs="0789"/>the present negotiations by sending new tanks and mines into Berlin. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> explained that this was part of the deliberate effort on our part during the Berlin crisis to take military measures which, while they would not alarm the general public, would be detectable by the Russians. The Secretary asked that the military keep us closely informed about developments in this matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> said we should be careful not to give the impression that we are arbitrarily changing the status quo on Berlin. He added that we should be ready to offer evidence of Soviet military preparations in Berlin and East Germany.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Missiles in East Germany</p>
<p>4. The Secretary asked whether there had been any confirmation of a report that atomic capable missiles were being taken into East Germany. Mr. Bundy said that there had been no positive confirmation, although it was believed that other types of missiles had been introduced. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> said that there had been no observation of sites of ground-to-ground missiles in the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. Mr. Bundy agreed but pointed out that there had been sightings of covered equipment on flat cars with profiles similar to those of missiles paraded in Moscow. It was therefore thought likely that such missiles are in the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCA2">Sullivan</persName> commented that Oncken of the West German delegation yesterday told him that there was atomic capable artillery in East Germany.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Press Matters</p>
<p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said that there was much press interest in the figures the Secretary yesterday presented on the military strength of East Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said that he had circulated to the press here copies of the Department’s statement reacting to the Soviet note on atomic armaments in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries.<note n="2" xml:id="d334fn2">For text of this May 25 statement and the Soviet note of May 23, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1945–1959</hi>, vol.

<p rend="sectiontitleital"><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s Meeting with the President</p>
<p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> suggested that the Secretary speak to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> about <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s remark on Berlin at his breakfast with the President last Friday.<note n="3" xml:id="d334fn3">See <ref target="#d326">Document 326</ref>.</note> The Secretary observed that the report of this talk indicated that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> had repeated points he had made to the Secretary,<note n="4" xml:id="d334fn4">See <ref target="#d269fn3">footnote 3, Document 269</ref>.</note> namely, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is flexible on Berlin but concerned about bolstering the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>.</p>

<p>Referring to the Geneva meetings, the President said it has seemed to him that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> is succeeding in what we have always wanted to do—to be firm without being nasty or offensive. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> added that <pb xml:id="pg_767" n="767" facs="0792"/>he thought we have had a fair measure of success in accomplishing what <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster Dulles</persName> had always hoped for—that is to make clear to the world that our proposals are reasonable and constructive.</p>
<p>The President next mentioned the luncheon he was planning to have for the visiting Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers.<note n="1" xml:id="d337fn1">President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> held a luncheon at 12:30 on May 28 for the Foreign Ministers and distinguished foreign dignitaries who attended <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ funeral.</note> He asked that the State Department assure each individual invited that there is no obligation whatsoever upon them to stay for the luncheon unless they want to. He said he simply planned to say at the luncheon that he has asked them as a measure of courtesy to their governments and appreciation for their attendance at the funeral services of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. He would offer a single toast to the memory of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the State Department had, as the President requested, considered the idea of a meeting of the four Foreign Ministers, and thought that such a meeting would be of very definite value. The President said that what he had in mind was simply to ask them in and tell them that it is, in his judgment, ridiculous that the world is divided into segments facing each other in unending hostility. He felt that decent men should be able to find some way to make progress toward a better state of things. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought it would be advantageous to have it known, at least generally, that the President had taken this position. The President stressed that he wanted to make confidential the nature of the specific discussions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> added that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had asked if he could call on the President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought that the meeting the President spoke of would take care of this request. The President said he would bring out that he had been anxious to see the group, but didn’t see how he could see them other than all together.</p>
<p>The President then referred to the question regarding the place of a possible summit meeting. His views were by no means fixed on this. He thought our willingness to accept any of several solutions might give us a little trading material. He is somewhat inclined against Geneva because it has a reputation for failure and frustration (he mentioned that one of Napoleon’s criteria in selecting an officer for high command was “is he lucky?”). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that the problem relating to Vienna is that the Russians are planning to have the “youth congress” there and this would preclude its use for anything else during August. The President mentioned his idea of inviting a very large group of Soviet students to attend American colleges for a year, as a one-shot proposition. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> mentioned that the exchange of students has been a very sensitive point with the Russians. The President said he realized this, but felt a large scale offer might “break loose something.” He said he would like <pb xml:id="pg_768" n="768" facs="0793"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> to think the matter over. At the proper time, talks with key leaders in the Congress on a very discreet basis would be necessary. He added that he had talked with J. Edgar Hoover<note n="2" xml:id="d337fn2">Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</note> about this and Mr. Hoover had thought the idea an excellent one and commented that it would not make his work more difficult.</p>
<p>With regard to the Geneva meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said it had been mostly sparring thus far. The Soviets are insistent on two peace treaties for Germany. There is some fear that they are making a play for favor with the satellites by trying to set up the East German Republic. They are sensitive, however, on the issue of two peace treaties, since they try to call their proposal a “peace treaty with Germany” rather than separate treaties with two Germanies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that allied unity has been excellent so far, with agreement not to take moves in the conference without prior consultation. He said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has maintained a very courteous manner, but is evidently operating under very tight instructions from Moscow. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he hoped for something effective to come out of the plane trip back to Geneva. There will be no press present. Each person will have one assistant present to make notes. He hopes for candid discussions.</p>
<p>In general, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> thought that the Soviets are trying to outwait the West in terms of offering modifications to their initial position. He thought that the time may come when he would want to state a deadline for positive results in the conference. The President agreed but said that we do not want to be too quick in setting such a deadline. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he is trying to work away from the constant tendency of the press to report the conference in terms of who won and who lost on each particular topic. On the matter of disarmament, he thought that some progress could be made, for example in arranging a forum to consider the matter, and a time and a place for meetings. At present the eighty-two nations of the United Nations constitute a committee on disarmament. His hope is to see if the Soviets can be brought down to something reasonable. At this point he showed the President a letter from <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d337fn3">Dated May 21. (Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204, German Officials with <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>) In it, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> thanked <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> for visiting Bonn on his way to Geneva (see <ref target="#d288">Document 288</ref>) and outlined his views on disarmament as summarized below.</note> which the President called “very good.” The President went on to comment, however, that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s statement that only through agreement on disarmament can progress on other problems be made was too restrictive. He agreed as to its importance but he thought that many other measures must and could be taken in the interim.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_769" n="769" facs="0794"/>
<p>The President agreed that the status of Berlin cannot be definitively settled except in the context of Germany as a whole. He therefore did not think that an interim agreement on Berlin could be accepted as the price to be paid for the summit meeting by the Soviets. He agreed that we should never be inflexible except on the two or three things that are basic to our whole position, the chief one being the rights and responsibilities in Berlin that we have.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that the allies are in complete agreement on the things they are opposed to, such as accepting a reduction of our rights in Berlin. They are not yet clear on the positive aspects however. He is inclined to feel that a temporary solution regarding Berlin may be possible, but he stressed the point of its temporary nature, since we cannot agree, in effects to have three Germanies (the two now existing plus Berlin). He thought it is possible that we can deal with Berlin with the Soviets. They are pressing for recognition of East Germany. The West Germans are dead set against this, but are keen to make additional contacts with the East Germans. The President thought this was a hopeful sign. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said the West Germans; however, want us to sit in with them in any committees wherein they meet with East Germans; they are terribly afraid of being left alone with this Communist group, dominated by the Kremlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said there is a little something to work on and hoped to get <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on the plane to say more clearly what the Russians have in mind. The President suggested that perhaps as a parallel to the committee, steps could be taken such that the newspapers of both East and West Germany could circulate freely each in the other’s area.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> next raised the question of time, place and agenda for a summit meeting. The period of July and August he thought was difficult because we do not know what the Congress will do. The President commented that as at Geneva the Foreign Ministers would meet in the morning and the Heads of Government in the afternoon, largely to confirm what they had done. If the meeting continued for a while, he thought he could come back to the United States for a week, with the Vice President sitting in for him. The President added that perhaps it would not be too bad to have the meeting while the Congress is in session. This would tend to keep Congressmen out of Geneva, if that is where it is held. Also some things may come up wherein Congressional backing would be of value. He said he would accept August for the date of the meeting if the meeting seemed to show promise of being meaningful.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that it is possible that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would leave the meeting when the President left, for prestige reasons. The President thought this problem could be eased through his saying that he would return. The President said he could go as early as the first of July. He wished to help <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in the matter, and was therefore <pb xml:id="pg_770" n="770" facs="0795"/>willing to rule out September. Finally, the President said that any time consistent with the foregoing that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> thought was all right would be acceptable to him.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> raised another point regarding the summit meeting. He had told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, when he kept pressing for Polish and Czechoslovakian participation, that this raised the question whether the Soviets wanted them to come to the summit. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied, saying he was not raising that issue. Such a question would be taken up separately. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> felt that a summit meeting must be limited to the four Heads of Government. The President agreed.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said the French are extremely sensitive on the question of having nuclear testing as an agenda item since they are not involved in those negotiations. They would not object to the matter being discussed in “side conversations” by the other three powers, however, so long as it is not on the agenda. The President said that if he could get agreement on the question of testing at the summit he would certainly do so. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> added that the British are taking a very stout stand in insisting with us that the quota of inspections that they have proposed must be decided upon on the basis of technical factors.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> returned to the question of “breaking Berlin out of the Western package.” He thought we must do so, working for a solution which would be temporary in nature. The President said he agreed and had always thought so. Regarding the link between German reunification and the European security zone, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said the French and the Germans had always opposed the latter without reunification. The British may push us very hard on this, however. He did not think that we should pay such a price for a Berlin settlement.</p>
<p>The President said his thought has always been to link the European security zone with a larger security arrangement.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> asked how long he should plan to stay in Geneva. The President said it is hard to say; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> could stay longer if some little progress was being made. If he comes to a brick wall, however, he thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> should set a day for stopping the discussions since they were getting nowhere and the Ministers might as well go home. The President recalled that both <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had made statements that if no progress is made in the Foreign Ministers meeting, a summit meeting is all the more necessary. The President said he utterly disagreed with this concept. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he was in full accord with the President and he suspected that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> is, too. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he hoped he would have something more to report after his plane ride with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>

</list>
<p>At this conference, no one was present to take notes, but this memorandum will, I think, serve to review the highlights of the discussion. At the outset, the President thanked the three Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, France and Soviet Russia for their great courtesy and thoughtfulness in making it possible for all of us to come to Washington for the funeral. He then said that he did not want to have any substantive discussion with respect to our negotiations, but that he did want to make it quite clear that he hoped we would make sufficient progress so that a subsequent Summit Meeting would be worthwhile. He emphasized the fact that he personally was willing to go anywhere at any time to talk with anyone if such talks would advance the cause of world understanding and peace but that he felt it would be a hoax on the hopes of mankind if a Summit Meeting should be held and end up in further disagreement without some progress being made.</p>
<p>There were some very amusing exchanges, with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> saying that before coming into the meeting with the President we had been discussing the question of having Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thrown out of the plane unless we reached substantial agreement before returning to Geneva. It turned out that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had been giving some thought to this question, and decided it was not just a procedural matter but a substantive one in which a majority vote could not be binding, and that he felt he might be justified in using a veto. To Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s delight, the President agreed with him thoroughly with respect to the use of the veto in this instance, and also suggested it might be well if our plane were to be refueled over and over again before Geneva on the understanding we would not return until agreement had been reached.</p>
<p>In expressing his own philosophy in respect to meeting with people and the desirability of direct contacts, the President said that from his point of view he found that people did not wear horns merely because of nationality, race or religion but because of their own innate qualities of cussedness. He went pretty far in emphasizing the desirability of people <pb xml:id="pg_772" n="772" facs="0797"/>talking to each other, including the East and West Germans. At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> called the attention of the other Foreign Ministers to what the President had said and expressed his own full agreement.</p>
<p>After the conversation, I suggested to the President that perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> might pick up this particular point and utilize it to his own advantage and that it would be desirable for the President at luncheon, when he would have the opportunity of talking with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, to make it very clear that his remarks were in no way a reflection on the West Germans reluctance to talk to the East Germans. The President said he would do this and reminded me that he had reassured Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> the previous day<note n="1" xml:id="d338fn1">Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, who had attended <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ funeral, met with both the President and <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> on May 27. In the meeting at 11 with the President he reiterated his concern about British weakness at Geneva and the President tried to reassure him. (Memorandum of conversation; <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_WAC1">Whitman</persName> File, DDE Diaries; see also <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Diaries</hi>, pp. 363–364) In the dinner conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> repeated his concern, but also discussed the Middle East, the German economy, and domestic German politics. (Memorandum for the President, June 2; <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_WAC1">Whitman</persName> File)</note> with respect to the real firmness of our Allied relationship.</p>
<p>The President concluded the discussion by showing us various paintings in his room as well as an album of photographs of paintings for which he himself was responsible. The whole atmosphere was most friendly and I think <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> appreciated it, particularly when President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to convey a courteous message to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and received through <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reciprocal sentiments on behalf of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Berlin</item>
</list>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> opened the conversation by stating that we would be very interested to hear the basis for the Soviets’ dissatisfaction with the situation in Berlin. We understand that the Soviet Union wants a change in the situation. The Western representatives would like to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> discuss the problem of Berlin and they desire a frank and open discussion of the problem. We are willing to live with the present situation and desire to know what the Soviets want.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> opened by stating that he had tried to explain this several times and moreover Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had made a number of statements on the same subject. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would, however, be glad to repeat the substance of these statements. He noted at this point that it was his plan the day after tomorrow to speak at some length at the plenary on this subject.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated that the present situation in Berlin is unnatural. Berlin is an island surrounded by the territory of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> which has an entirely different regime from that existing in Berlin. Moreover, around West Berlin and Berlin are located Soviet troops and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> forces, both the Soviet Union and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> being members of the <pb xml:id="pg_774" n="774" facs="0799"/>Warsaw Pact. Now an island occupied by foreign troops—those of the Western Powers—located in the center of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, created an unnatural situation. It was unnatural from the geographical point of view. Moreover, the present occupation regime in Berlin cannot be justified under present conditions. The Soviet Government recognizes that the Western Powers do have rights and that they have these rights under agreements to which the Soviet Union was a party. But fourteen years have elapsed and conditions have changed radically, including, among other things, the creation of two new sovereign states, namely, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and also the <gloss target="#t_GFR1">GFR</gloss>. To put it briefly, the occupation has outlived itself. That is the second consideration, aside from geographical considerations. Third, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on to state, the present situation in Berlin is a dangerous one. There may be unexpected incidents, incidents which are not wanted by either side, by the Western Powers, by the USSR, or by the Germans. The Soviet Union does not want such incidents which would arise from the presence of Western troops in an occupation status in Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented, you will say, of course, that nothing has happened for fourteen years. But all of us bear a great responsibility and it is not wise for us to continue to maintain a delicate situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then continued to his fourth point which he introduced by stating that it was not the most important one. West Berlin is a center for subversive activities, military intelligence activities on behalf of the forces of the Western Powers, also espionage, propaganda, radio stations. He believed that to some extent the West Germans were involved in this. You know better than I do, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, what these activities are. As a passing example, he referred to the underground tunnel which had tapped the land lines of the Soviet Union forces,<note n="2" xml:id="d339fn2">Regarding the Berlin tunnel used to tap Soviet communications lines in 1956, see the editorial note in <ref target="frus1955-57v26"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, vol. XXVI</ref>, p. 551.</note> but emphasized that this was only a past illustration. One cannot consider this situation normal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on, once again, to emphasize that this last point was not the most important of the considerations to have in mind regarding Berlin. If the Western Powers say that they can correct these things, the Soviet Union would answer that they do not constitute the essence of the Berlin problem.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that if we understand our responsibilities and act in a responsible way, we wiil not continue an occupation having all of these dangers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted that the Western Powers would ask whether West Berlin under the Soviet proposals would fall to the Soviet Union or to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Soviets do not need West Berlin. As to the question of whether the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will change the regime in West Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s answer was an emphatic no. He stated that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> <pb xml:id="pg_775" n="775" facs="0800"/>does not want West Berlin any more than does the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, he stated, wants to negotiate with you and is prepared to give guarantees for the continued status of West Berlin. It is prepared to permit West Berlin to keep the same social order. With respect to communications between West Berlin and the outside—i.e., West Germany—one of the most crucial problems—the Soviet Union is prepared to give guarantees. It will even call in the United Nations to take part. On this point the Soviets are open-minded. It could be a combination of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the Four Powers. The Soviet Union has exchanged views with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the Soviet Union fully understands its responsibilities. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is prepared to take part in the guarantees proposed by the Soviet Union and they will keep their word and carry out the agreement. When they sign they will carry out their agreement and the Soviet Union and others will also keep their word. The Soviet Union does not want to provoke tensions and it is extremely serious on this. With respect to communications, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on, the guarantees should not be in a form inconsistent with the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then emphasized that he was expressing his views very frankly.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then stated that if you and your governments think that we are not sincere in our proposals respecting West Berlin, you will be making a great mistake. We mean what we say. If you believe us, we shall be able to work out a solution, not only of this problem but of other problems as well. Berlin is the first problem calling for a radical solution which would really be in the interest of lessening tensions. This can be done without sacrifice, of principles or of the interests of the Western Powers regarding West Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on to state that the first and most radical solution of the Berlin problem was to have all troops withdrawn in the interests of lessening tension. If, however, the Western Powers are not prepared to agree to this, the Soviet Union would consent to having small symbolic units remain there. He noted that both the West and the Soviet Union knew that the troops in Berlin were only symbolic anyway. By leaving symbolic units there, there would be no affront to the prestige of the Western Powers and the Germans would be satisfied. The Soviet Union is prepared to discuss what number would constitute a symbolic unit. The Soviets are open-minded about this. He then referred to the possibility of mixed units in West Berlin and apparently suggested Soviet participation in the symbolic units to be left in West Berlin. He went on to repeat that the Soviet Union would prefer to have all troops out of West Berlin but would consider the second alternative that he had mentioned. A third alternative referred to by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was to have other “neutral” troops in West Berlin, “neutrality” not necessarily being determined on ideological grounds. They could be any nonparticipants in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_776" n="776" facs="0801"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> repeated that he did not mention the number of troops although he felt that the less the better.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> expressed the view that there is a possibility of a solution to this problem, because the Western Powers have so many choices. It should be possible for us to find a solution if we really wish to do so. The Soviet Union has given relatively flexible proposals and the Western Powers should not be rigid. It would be wrong to take that attitude. The Soviet Union desires to work out a solution at this time and will go as far as possible in attempting to do so although its very proposals had taken into account possible varying attitudes on the part of the Western Powers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> commented that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had done the same in talking to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d339fn3">See <ref target="#d183">Documents 183</ref> ff.</note> He wanted to make a solution easier.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> asked what would come next if we reach an arrangement at Geneva, Will you make a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> even though we reach agreement on West Berlin. You have repeatedly said that if we do not agree to a German peace treaty, you would enter into a separate peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s reply was to state that if we reach agreement on West Berlin, we do not have to face a situation where the Soviet Union is not performing its obligations. In that event there will be no complications. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will be a signatory of the agreement and will make no trouble. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> inquired whether, if we Four Powers reach agreement, will the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> separately give a declaration.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> answered that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will sign the agreement or may make a separate declaration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> asked whether the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the Soviet Union would make an agreement noting that the Soviet Union already has an agreement with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> (referring to the <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> letters).<note n="4" xml:id="d339fn4">See <ref target="#d31fn5">footnote 5, Document 31</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted that in the 1949 agreement<note n="5" xml:id="d339fn5">For text of the final communiqué of the 1949 Council of Foreign Ministers Meeting at Paris, June 20, 1949, see <ref target="frus1949v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 1062–1065.</note> the Soviet Union had undertaken certain obligations and that in its agreement with East Germany it reserved these obligations. Now the Soviet Union is proposing to make a new agreement with respect to these obligations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> pressed his point, again asking whether the Soviet Union would make an agreement with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> answered vaguely that they would make some agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> then asked why the Soviet Union desired to give up its obligations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> answered that the situation was outmoded. They were unable to explain this to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and moreover there were Soviet troops in the vicinity.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_777" n="777" facs="0802"/>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> noted that some of the things which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said were very important and we would like to have them in writing so that there can be no misunderstanding. We desire to study these statements very thoroughly.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> interjected that the basic difficulty was with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s second reason. The first one, geographical, was tiresome and could not be helped, and the others were more important. The third, relating to incidents, was not very important in that the Four Powers are really in control and can minimize incidents between East and West Berlin. With respect to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s fourth point, subversive activities, that could be discussed. The real difficulty was with respect to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s second point, namely, that the time has now come to end the occupation of West Berlin. It is the position of the Western Powers that this can end only when we reunite Germany. Failure to agree on reunification means a continuance of the interim period. We cannot sacrifice our rights in Berlin unless and until there is some agreement on reunification. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that it was hard to stomach Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement that the time has come to end the occupation without any agreement on reunification. There is no real difference of views on the question of whether West Berlin should continue to maintain its existing social system on access, etc. But why go into the doctrine of ending the occupation status. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> noted that the juridical basis of occupation did harm to no one and it did not change anything. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s retort was to say that the Western Powers were asking for something for nothing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that the Western Powers would be glad to examine the causes of tension in Berlin and on access and want to satisfy the Soviet Union on these points. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> inquired whether or not the Western Powers were interested in continuing the social order in Berlin. Why, otherwise, are troops of the Western Powers situated there. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> interjected at this point that such troops were symbolic. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> answered that in that event they were there to maintain social order.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that if the Soviets desired to change the Berlin situation which had arisen as a result of the events of 1945, why were they not prepared to go back and give up to the Western Powers the territories that the Soviet Union had acquired as a result of that same set of circumstances. Part of the agreement through which the Soviet Union acquired these territories was the status of Western Berlin. He felt that the Soviet Union was being one-sided.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then noted that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made an important statement regarding our rights. We say leave them unimpaired. We desire to stabilize the situation within the framework of our rights. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> raised a question as to the existing status of West Berlin. It now is a government and sends people to the Bundestag who act as observers <pb xml:id="pg_778" n="778" facs="0803"/>and have no vote. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> answered that the same system would apply under the plan offered by the Soviet Union. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> noted that the Socialists were in charge of West Berlin. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> commented that East Berlin would also vote for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> if it had a chance, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s only reply was to say that East Berlin is East Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> inquired as to the relationship of East Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> answered that East Berlin is the capital of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, whereupon Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> asked whether East Berlin is a part of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that it is the capital. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then noted that under the same line of reasoning, West Berlin is a part of West Germany and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s only reply was in the nature of “ugh”.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> noted that all Berlin had the same status. Only if East Berlin is not a part of East Germany is West Germany not a part of West Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> insisted that West Berlin was in the center of East Germany, whereupon Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that Alaska is also situated in a way of speaking in the center of Canada.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> returned to the point that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> admits that we have rights and we should be able to make an adjustment within these rights.</p>
<p>In answer, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted that there are so many problems between us that we should not neglect an opportunity to solve this one. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> noted that we already agreed to discuss it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s answer was to say that this can be a beginning. In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName>’s question as to whether <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had a draft of his Berlin statement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that if understanding is reached, it will be easy to work out the details.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had given us the Soviet proposal respecting Berlin. He inquired what was Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s second position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the Western Powers are the rigid ones. The Soviet Union has demonstrated flexibility and given alternatives in advance. It did its very best to understand the Western position and gave alternatives to the Western Powers in order to make it easier for them to agree to a solution. It is not enough to say that the proposal of the Soviet Union is no good. The Soviet Union tried to make the position of the Western Powers easier and told them exactly why. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> implied that the Soviet proposals were their last word, subject to willingness to negotiate on the points he had mentioned.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> commented that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had emphasized that a number of incidents might arise from the existing situation in Berlin although this had not eventuated in fourteen years. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> felt that the absence of Western troops might well increase the likelihood of incidents because of the direct confrontation of the East and West Germans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> insisted that the Western Powers must <pb xml:id="pg_779" n="779" facs="0804"/>take responsibility. The Soviet Union and the East Germans will take the same position on this question.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then commented that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the time had come to call off the agreements because they were outmoded. What assurance did the Western Powers have that, say in five or ten years, the Soviet Union would not say that the guarantees were outmoded. We, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, believe that agreements should be kept but the Soviet Union denounces them unilaterally. How do we know that you won’t denounce these new agreements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that if he were talking about unilateral action, he would not be discussing these matters in the plane.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> noted that the Western Powers will do anything reasonable to relieve tensions, they were prepared to go far, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that this was of secondary importance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> insisted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> put the relaxation of tensions as of the first importance in the Moscow talks.<note n="6" xml:id="d339fn6">Presumably the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> talks; see footnote 3 above.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> insisted that it was only secondary—the real question is the existence of an occupation regime in the center of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> must know, from reports from his Embassy in Washington, that there was a strong U.S. public opinion on the points at issue. The American people are not prepared to give up their rights unless something is gained in replacement of them. They are unanimous on that—all parties and all points of view in the United States and France. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> concurred in this statement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then continued that accordingly we should seek to work out a solution in the framework of existing rights. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> noted that the existing situation does not harm anyone as far as the juridical situation is concerned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he could not distinguish the juridical situation from the facts. You have troops in Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> noted that the Soviet Union had many troops in East Germany. In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName>’s question of what was meant by “symbolic” troops in West Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that they were prepared to discuss this point. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> then sought to clarify the point as to whether or not Soviet troops would be included in those located in West Berlin assuming we were able to reach agreement on a symbolic number. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that this would be the case only in West Berlin; East Berlin is the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then asked about our rights with respect to greater Berlin and referred to the agreements that had been made in this regard. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked how long such agreements were to continue in force. There had also been a Potsdam Agreement. He insisted that time had somehow changed the situation and that <pb xml:id="pg_780" n="780" facs="0805"/>East Berlin was out of the picture. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> then commented that the Soviet Union could not, in that event, challenge the right of the Western Powers to give West Berlin to the <gloss target="#t_GFR1">GFR</gloss> because that could be done on the same basis as that on which the Soviet Union purported to give East Berlin to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s only answer was to insist that East Berlin was out of the question.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> inquired as to the basis on which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> proposed to station Soviet troops in West Berlin and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he wanted some new basis there.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had mentioned rights of the Western Powers in West Berlin. What exactly did they mean by that. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the situation had changed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> stated that the rights of the Western Powers stemmed from the defeat and occupation of Germany but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> insisted that such rights were derived from agreements. Now the situation has changed. There are no longer occupation zones. There are two sovereign German states. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then went on to state that if the Western Powers are interested in keeping the social order in West Berlin, that will be guaranteed. If they are interested in access, that will be guaranteed. After all, why are the Western troops in Berlin. They have no military importance. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> noted that they were symbolic. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Soviet Union was, although reluctantly, prepared to accept troops. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> insisted that in 1964 the Soviet Union might well again say that the situation had changed and that the agreement of guarantee was outmoded.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> inquired why the Western Powers could not ask the Soviet Union to give up some of its rights and give the Western Powers more rights. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not answer directly, but said that if the Western Powers wished a guarantee of troops in West Berlin, even though there was no need for them, the Soviets would consider this, notwithstanding the fact that the situation was unnatural.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> inquired of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> whether Berlin had any military advantage. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> replied that it was only symbolic. The troops in Berlin couldn’t support themselves if the Soviet Union took action but if the Soviet Union did act, our troops would be involved and we would be involved. He stated that he did not know how many troops make a symbol. He did note, however, in respect of number, that the situation in Berlin was stabilized and he could not conjecture as to the effect of any reduction in those forces. The reduction in forces there might provoke incidents. In any event, Berlin had no place in a war plan. The real problem is the unilateral feature of the Soviet proposal. The real answer to how long the situation should continue is how long it will take to reach another agreement.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_781" n="781" facs="0806"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then commented that if there were agreement on unification, the situation might be different. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the situation existing as a result of acceptance of the Soviet proposals would be temporary and only last until the reunification of Germany.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then turned to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and asked if he had any ideas about European security. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> replied that the Western Powers had outlined phased measures designed to maintain European security in connection with their peace plan involving reunification of Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that he thought the Western Powers might have some more realistic ideas, some separate proposals which could be discussed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then referred to the all <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> disarmament committee and noted how difficult it was to accomplish anything with so many nations involved.</p>
<p>The conversation then lapsed into generalities although several times later in the evening Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> inquired when the Western Powers were going to recognize East Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">de Murville</persName> also noted later in the evening that we were desirous of settling the Berlin problem but this would not be easy if the Soviet Union maintained its present position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that it would be easy if the Western Powers were reasonable.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 43. For the President from the Secretary.</p>
<p>“Dear Mr. President</p>
<p>I think the Four Foreign Ministers Conference aboard the plane<note n="1" xml:id="d340fn1">See <ref target="#d339">Document 339</ref>.</note> served a very useful purpose. A very full text of the substance of our conversations is being forwarded to the Department and will of course be available to you, but some of the highlights will I know be of special interest. The conversations were arranged so that the eight of us aboard the plane were seated in two sets of four seats across the aisle with the four Foreign Ministers sitting on the aisle. This allowed the conversations to be heard by each of us without any voice straining. I opened up <pb xml:id="pg_782" n="782" facs="0807"/>the session by recounting briefly the events which had led to our meeting and the fact that it was the Russians who had expressed dissatisfaction with the situation in Berlin and that I felt Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should talk to us frankly as to why the Russians were dissatisfied and what they felt might be done to remedy the situation. This led to a long exposé by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> couched in moderate terms but with many of the old familiar arguments. There were of course interruptions with questions from time to time. When it came down to specific proposals and exchanges of views, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was quite explicit and at least from our point of view three favorable developments ensued:</p>
<list>
<item>1. That any arrangement with respect to Berlin would be considered temporary pending German reunification;</item>
<item>2. That the Russians would give very explicit guarantees with respect to the maintenance of the free order in Berlin both politically and economically and complete freedom of access to maintain that position, and that the Russians could assure that similar guarantees would be given by the East Germans either in adhering to the same document or in a separate declaration, and that the Russians would accept some form of recognition by the U.N. to observe and report on how they were being carried out;</item>
<item>3. That Allied troops together with some Russian contingent could remain in West Berlin as a token presence of the four responsible powers.</item>
</list>
<p>The completely unacceptable concept from our point of view of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s suggestions lays in two particulars. First that in any new agreement our occupational rights would be given up in favor of the new arrangements and, second, that a contingent of Russian troops should be stationed in West Berlin together with the troops of the three Allied powers. On the latter point, it is my guess that we can probably talk the Russians out of the Russian presence. With respect to the former, I think they may stand pat and it is possible that we could get a Berlin negotiation narrowed down to this one point for settlement at a Summit Conference. However, until the above favorable points have been firmed up through discussions of written documents, I have no certainty that they will stick.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the talks was good and I feel that your own courtesies to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d340fn2">See <ref target="#d338">Document 338</ref>.</note> as well as his inclusion with us aboard the plane have done much to at least relax tensions as between ourselves and may well be of very real importance in discussions to come.</p>
<p>Faithfully,</p>
<p>Signed: Chris”</p>

</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> raised the question of the procedure which the Foreign Ministers should follow in their future conversations. He suggested that they should decide the relationship between private talks and talks in Plenary Session.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that in his view the present discussion should be regarded as a continuation of the earlier discussion in the aircraft.<note n="1" xml:id="d341fn1">See <ref target="#d339">Document 339</ref>.</note> As to future procedure, the Foreign Ministers should decide from time to time what suited them best. They should make procedure their servant.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he would like a Plenary meeting on the following day, May 30. He wished to make a statement on Berlin replying to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s statement on the same subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn2">See <ref target="#d335fn1">Document 335 and footnote 1</ref> thereto.</note> The other Foreign Ministers were having dinner with him that night and private conversations could then be pursued. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thought that all methods and procedures should remain open. The Foreign Ministers could decide upon what suited them best at any particular time.</p>
<p>It was agreed that there should be a Plenary Session on May 30 and that further plans should be made at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s dinner that evening. It was further agreed that no statements should be made to the press about private meetings, except by agreement between the Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> then summarised the conversations which had taken place in the aircraft. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had expressed concern about the abnormal situation in Berlin. He had said that it was necessary to <pb xml:id="pg_784" n="784" facs="0809"/>normalise the situation by ending the occupation regime. The status of West Berlin could be safeguarded. The Soviet Government had no wish to change the social order of West Berlin. It was willing to give guarantees on access, the economic life of West Berlin, etc. The D.D.R. would give similar guarantees either as a signatory to whatever agreement was reached or by making a separate declaration or declarations. It would also be possible for the United Nations to take part in such guarantees. Exactly how this could be done was a matter for discussion.</p>
<p>As to the Western troops in West Berlin, the Western Foreign Ministers regarded them as symbolic of the protection of the West Berliners. All four Foreign Ministers had agreed that these troops were not of military significance.</p>
<p>As to the occupation rights of the Western Powers in respect of Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had admitted that they existed. But he contended that they should be replaced by a new contractual agreement. The Western Foreign Ministers, on the other hand, had made it clear that they regarded these rights as inalienable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had rejected the idea that West and East Berlin were on the same footing. He had said that East Berlin was the capital of the D.D.R. He had, however, maintained that the Federal Republic was not entitled to the same rights in Berlin as those which in his view the D.D.R. enjoyed in East Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said that a symbolic number of Soviet troops could be stationed in West Berlin. But he had not agreed that the arrangements for stationing troops of the Four Powers could be put upon an all-Berlin basis.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that, since it was the Soviet Government who had raised the Berlin question in its present form, it would be appropriate for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to explain his views. If the Foreign Ministers were to make progress on the Berlin question, they should continue to discuss it privately. The Western Foreign Ministers were ready for such discussions.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> thought that discussion might proceed on the following basis:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) The Soviet Government had expressed anxiety about the abnormal situation in Berlin which, it said, might give rise to incidents. The Western Foreign Ministers were ready to discuss what could be done to remove the possibility of such incidents taking place.</item>
<item>(b) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> must accept the fact, arising out of historical events, that the Western Powers had a special juridical position in Berlin, This position could only be altered by German reunification and the conclusion of a German Peace Treaty, events which might be some distance away in the future. It must be understood that the Western position in these matters was absolutely firm.</item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_785" n="785" facs="0810"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had based his argument for altering the status of West Berlin upon four points:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) the geographical situation of Berlin;</item>
<item>(b) the abnormality of the continued occupation of Berlin;</item>
<item>(c) the danger of incidents;</item>
<item>(d) “subversive” activities, etc.</item>
</list>
<p>The facts of geography could not be altered. But points (b), (c) and (d) presented material for discussion. As regards the danger of incidents, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> thought that it was reduced by the presence of Western troops. As he saw it, the crux of the Soviet position was the argument that the lapse of time had made the occupation of Berlin obsolete. This was not of course the view of the Western Powers, who could not accept that any one of the Four Powers could terminate Four Power agreements by unilateral action. This difference of view did not, however, mean that it was not possible or desirable to seek a modus vivendi or an interim solution pending German reunification.</p>
<p>Any unilateral denunciation of the Four Power agreements would strike at the basis of the confidence between the Great Powers and remove the possibility of lessening tension between them. The question at issue was how to take the heat out of the Berlin problem without striking such a blow at confidence and thus to make interim arrangements conducive to peace and security.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Soviet Government was not proposing to take unilateral action. It had submitted its proposals for discussion. Otherwise he would not be at the Geneva Conference. The Soviet Government desired to reach agreement with the other Three Powers. Nevertheless, if no such agreement could be reached, the Soviet Government would be obliged to cease exercising certain of its functions in Germany, which would then certainly be taken over by the D.D.R.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> suggested that certain objectives were common to all four Governments, namely:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) the West Berliners should have the social order which they themselves preferred;</item>
<item>(b) there should be free access to West Berlin both for persons and for goods.</item>
</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> indicated agreement.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that the question was how these objectives could be secured. The Western Governments said that only the presence of Western troops in Berlin could maintain the freedom and confidence of the Berliners. The Soviet Government had said that the Western troops should be joined by Soviet troops in West Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> did not see the point of this proposal. Its logical counterpart would be the presence <pb xml:id="pg_786" n="786" facs="0811"/>of Western troops in East Berlin. If, as he understood, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> considered that the presence of Western troops in West Berlin was symbolic, why did he object to them being there?</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he had explained in the aircraft what his views were on this question of the status of East Berlin. He had nothing to add.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that the presence of Soviet troops in East Berlin was symbolic, just as the presence of Western troops in West Berlin was symbolic. If the Soviet Government chose to withdraw their troops from East Berlin, there was no way of stopping them, but such a withdrawal would not alter the status of East Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> drew attention to the presence in Berlin of Four Power organs, e.g. Spandau and the Air Control Centre.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> asked what arguments Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> adduced in favour of his suggestion that Soviet troops might join Western troops in West Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that this proposal was intended to be a compromise. But the best solution in the view of the Soviet Government would be the complete withdrawal of all Western troops from West Berlin and the creation of a free and demilitarised city of West Berlin.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> argued that West Berlin was in practice already demilitarised. The United States, French and United Kingdom garrisons in West Berlin were small and symbolic. The Western Governments were prepared to say that these garrisons were not there for military purposes. There were no German forces in West Berlin. The city was governed by a German administration. The practical effect was that West Berlin was a free and neutral city. Did not these arrangements meet Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s point?</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked why, if this was the situation, it was necessary for the Western troops [<hi rend="italic">Powers</hi>] to keep any troops at all in West Berlin.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that one reason why the Western Powers kept troops in West Berlin was because they had the undoubted right to do so.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that the Western Powers kept troops in the city because it preserved the confidence of the West Berliners and the maintenance of the way of life which they had freely chosen.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that so long as Western troops were kept in West Berlin, the occupation was continued. The strength of Western troops was irrelevant. Would not the Western Powers agree to replace their troops by neutral troops?</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> asked whether, according to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s reasons, even the presence of neutral troops would not constitute occupation.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_787" n="787" facs="0812"/>
<p>There was no question of Western troops interfering in the political life of West Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the mere presence of Western troops constituted such interference.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thought that, if Western troops were removed from West Berlin, the present regime and social order in West Berlin would change. He also asked whether it was Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s intention to suggest that a “free city” of West Berlin should be created by agreement between the Soviet Government and the three Western Governments.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> confirmed that that was his intention. There were, however, different forms which such an agreement could take.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that he considered that West Berlin already enjoyed guarantees from the Four Powers under the Quadripartite Agreements. At any rate, such guarantees continued to operate unless the Agreements were unilaterally denounced.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that the West Berliners were a free people. They had indicated by a free vote that they wished to preserve the symbolic presence of Western troops in West Berlin. The inconsistency in the Soviet position was the Soviet Government’s denial of a similar choice to the East Berliners. The mere fact of this denial was a source of anxiety to the West Berliners.</p>
<p>Turning to the question of access to Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that the Western Governments had accepted in good faith Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement about the willingness of the Soviet Government to give guarantees on this subject.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that there was free access to West Berlin at present. It was therefore a question of how to maintain what already existed.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed, but said that it was a question of working out the necessary guarantees. An agreement could be reached between the Four Powers for jointly guaranteeing access. The D.D.R. could be associated with such an agreement in an appropriate form.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> asked what would happen if the D.D.R. officials interfered with free access in any way.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that, in that case, it would be the joint responsibility of the Four Powers to restore the situation.</p>
<p>Summing up the conversation, M. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that there were three main points of difference between the Soviet Government and the Western Governments:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) the continuance of the occupation status;</item>
<item>(b) the Soviet suggestion for stationing of troops in West Berlin;</item>
<item>(c) the Soviet proposal for the creation of a “free city”.</item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_788" n="788" facs="0813"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> raised the question of East Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that East Berlin was part of the D.D.R. There was no occupation regime there.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that an occupation regime existed in East Berlin even if the Soviet Government did not choose to exercise its occupation functions. He asked whether it was not a fact that, when the Soviet Union had made an agreement with the D.D.R., that agreement had provided for a different status for East Berlin. He did not see why it was necessary for the D.D.R. to have their capital in East Berlin. Why could they not choose Dresden or Leipzig?</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the D.D.R. had exercised its sovereign right to choose its own capital and had chosen East Berlin.</p>
<p>M. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that the Soviet proposal for a “free city” was a proposal for making West Berlin an independent state. Was it the intention of the Soviet Government to create an East German state? If so, this was a concept which the Western Powers must reject.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that it was not a question of creating a third state. It was a question of interference or non-interference. When he spoke of the independence of a free city of West Berlin, what he meant was non-interference.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked whether there were any aspects of the relationship between the Federal Republic and West Berlin to which the Soviet Government objected. For instance, did Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> object to West Berlin being in the same currency area as the Federal Republic?</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he did not object to that. But he repeated that there should be no interference with West Berlin. He equated both the presence of Western troops and the continuance of the occupation regime with interference. If the Western Powers wished to have guarantees in respect of West Berlin, for instance as regards access, it was open to them to make suggestions.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that he thought it would be valuable if suggestions on this subject could be put down in writing as a basis for discussion.<note n="3" xml:id="d341fn3"><p>In <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 44, May 30 at noon, <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> cabled the following impression of this conversation:</p>
<p>“Private meeting at <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s villa 5 to 7 p.m. May 29 continued aircraft discussion of Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> with me.

<p>After noting he had discussed Soviet position on Berlin in Geneva and on plane back from United States, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reviewed Soviet proposals for “free city,” arguing they take account of different social order this enclave in <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and furnish firm legal basis for West Berlin. Said USSR ready to exchange views on way <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could be drawn in and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> ready to guarantee West Berlin status and free access to West. There would be supervisory standing committee of four powers and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Stated USSR wished improve economic situation West Berlin by furnishing food and raw materials in exchange for manufactures but wished no monopoly. Alleged economic development West Berlin lags well behind rest of Germany as compared with 1936.</p>
<p>Soviet proposals not detrimental to interests or prestige of states concerned. Not true, as alleged, that USSR will seize or blockade West <pb xml:id="pg_790" n="790" facs="0815"/>Berlin. Establishment free city not ideal situation which would be extension <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sovereignty to West Berlin. Hence acceptance by West not a concession to USSR. Free city would exist only until reunification of Germany and would assist in rapprochement between <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Federal Republic.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, in twenty minute rebuttal,<note n="3" xml:id="d342fn3">For text of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/30, May 30, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 225–229 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 128–132.</note> pointed out abnormal situation Berlin only reflection of abnormal situation Germany which could be ended by Western peace plan. Re Soviet contention presence Western troops increased tension, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> stated troops there not for warlike purposes but as symbols Western interest and Berliners overwhelmingly desired continued presence as evidenced by results latest elections. East-West tensions not caused by Berlin and in fact it good example peaceful coexistence with no serious incidents in ten years. Re Soviet contention West Berlin a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> spearhead, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> contrasted ten thousand Allied troops with twenty times that number Soviet troops in East Germany alone. Dismissed Soviet picture of economic bliss in East Germany as compared with West Berlin penury as mere propaganda. Observed Soviets say they are disturbed by “subversive” activities in West Berlin but West has complaints on that score also. Remarked that no doubt <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> maintained agreement to “free city” proposal would not be concession by West in order introduce light note in discussions.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> could not see why Soviets dissatisfied with present situation since Soviets profess to desire maintenance West Berlin social and economic way of life.

Since West cannot agree to Soviet proposals and Soviets reject Western proposals re interim solution for Berlin which advanced to meet Soviet concern, then present basic situation should continue with some improvements.</p>

However, present situation seriously disturbed once in fourteen years, i.e., blockade. This not result of local incident or agitation but of Soviet action.

West has not requested <pb xml:id="pg_791" n="791" facs="0816"/>change in situation but willing in true spirit of compromise to listen to Soviet proposals.

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 148. From the Secretary. After plenary session today I met with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> with two or three advisers each. I presented following to which all agreed.</p>
<p>“After dinner tonight with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> I think we should go back at <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on our plan for uniting Berlin and also re-emphasize that we are still talking within the framework of the Western Peace Plan which contemplates only an interim solution for Berlin pending reunification.</p>
<p>I think we should also summarize the situation along the following lines.</p>
<p>The three Western powers jointly make the following points:</p>
<list>
<item>1. They will not give up their rights of occupation in Berlin with unhindered access thereto.</item>
<item>2. They will not withdraw their military forces from West Berlin.</item>
<item>3. They have no intention of recognizing the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>.</item>
<item>4. If the Soviets unilaterally break their existing agreements with the Western powers or assert that they can transfer their obligations to the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> or otherwise impair the legal rights of the Western powers, then it would seem futile for the Western powers to enter into any agreement in future with the Soviet Union on any matter where the agreement was dependent on good faith rather than being completely</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_792" n="792" facs="0817"/>
<item>self-enforcing. With respect to West Berlin, under such circumstances, they will retain and exercise their rights which cannot be impaired by any such unilateral action.</item>
<item>5. There are other aspects of the Berlin situation which are negotiable on a basis of reciprocity. We would welcome arrangements which would reduce the Soviet expressed fear of ‘incidents’ and clarify the terms under which our rights are exercised, including in particular normal civilian intercourse for goods and people between West Berlin and the Federal Republic by all modes of transport.</item>
</list>
<p>Obviously the introduction of even ‘symbolic’ Soviet forces into West Berlin would be unacceptable. If ‘symbolic’ Soviet forces are to remain in Berlin, the place for them is East Berlin.”</p>

<item>Discussion of Soviet-Western Differences Concerning Berlin</item>
</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> opened the discussion after dinner by stating that in the talks on the plane returning from Washington and at the private meeting held the day before he had done most of the talking. He would like how to hear more of the views of the other Ministers. The Secretary pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said he could not talk about certain proposals we had made. There were certain things that we could not discuss. Where did that leave us? The Soviets had raised the question of Berlin and we had in good faith made proposals which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> now said he could not even discuss.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> interrupted to state that there were some things we could discuss later on. He had already mentioned two or three points. These included: (1) disarmament; (2) a zone; and (3) a non-aggression pact. In describing his list, he at one point mentioned a commission whereupon Pervoukhine and <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> immediately said “no” in Russian several times. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that they could not accept our proposals on Berlin as a basis for discussion and they would not discuss the extension of an occupation regime to East Berlin. East Berlin was part of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Secretary said then it was perhaps better to discuss what the Western Powers would not discuss and then we would know what area was left in which a possible agreement could be sought.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he could not agree that everything was all right in West Berlin. The Western Ministers had spoken of improvements in the present situation. He would like to know specifically what they had in mind.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he was asking us to give up our rights in Berlin. We would not do this even if our troops there were only symbolic. If the Soviets tried unilaterally to deprive us of our rights, no treaty with the Soviet Union would ever be any good.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he did not understand the Secretary’s logic. The Soviets had raised the question in order to discuss it. This was not unilateral action. He denied that he had threatened unilateral action.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that both <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said that if we did not agree to Soviet proposals, they would take unilateral action.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out that they were now in the process of negotiation.</p>
<p>The Secretary replied that the Russians said our proposals were unacceptable and could not be discussed.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was true when we talked about East Berlin. He asked if we wanted them to introduce an occupation regime in East <pb xml:id="pg_794" n="794" facs="0819"/>Berlin. The Secretary said that they had an occupation regime there now.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> denied this, stating that they were fulfilling certain functions between Berlin and West Germany and there were certain rudiments remaining from the time when there had been an occupation regime in East Berlin. They had a military commandant in East Berlin who was concerned with certain functions of liaison with the Soviet Army but had nothing to do with civilian authorities. They did fulfill functions in connection with communications. This was in the Western interest. The Secretary asked if this was not what the Soviets had agreed to do.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed this was so.</p>
<p>The Secretary said they had then tried to destroy this with the blockade. We had lived in peace in Berlin for ten years, now they wished to change the whole regime. The Soviets had created the East German Government but it had no authority. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had undertaken to see what the East German Government would do if an agreement was reached. It was perfectly clear that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was the child of the Russians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said with some heat that he rejected the Secretary’s words and asked him not to put such interpretation on words in his presence. It would be better to use them with respect to the West German Government. He had made his statement about East Germany because they had discussed the matter with the East Germans and knew what they were prepared to do.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that the East Germans and the Soviets were the same thing. There had never been any real elections in East Germany. The East Germans spoke for the Russians. It was better that the Russians spoke for both.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said we had not come here to discuss elections but to discuss problems between us. He urged that we keep the discussion on this basis.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he had asked us to be frank and we were being so with respect to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Soviets wanted us to recognize the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as a state.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that was up to us.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> interjected that we had not recognized the Soviet Union for 16 years. The Secretary said we were being frank in talking in realities. He asked if it were not true that the Soviets wanted us to recognize East Germany as a state.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out that East Germany existed. This problem had many sides but a discussion of this matter could lead too far. He suggested we not talk about ideology or internal matters but about problems between us.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_795" n="795" facs="0820"/>
<p>The Secretary inquired how long the East Germans represented at this Conference would last in office if they said or did anything contrary to Russian wishes. He agreed, however, to drop the subject. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> again suggested that we not discuss ideological matters. He inquired whether we thought the Soviets could make concession after concession and the Western Powers going on saying that the occupation regime was all right. The Soviets had expressed their willingness to negotiate but this was perhaps not understood correctly. The Western position seemed to be to stand on the same position and wait without making any change.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said the Western Powers could have taken this position but they had not. The Soviets had raised the question of Berlin and we had answered we were ready to listen and to try to understand and see what we could do to alleviate Soviet doubts and fears. The Secretary had said we could not give up our rights or remove our garrisons. Now what could be done?</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked if this meant that everything was good in West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that we did not complain. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Russians did.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> interjected to inquire what they complained of. He saw problems for them and for us as well. We must look to see what is practical. We cannot convince them and they cannot convince us. What could be done to improve the situation that lasted for ten years and was not too bad. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on the plane had said that certain things were of no great importance. In a speech today in full session, he had said they were very important. We also had complaints. The situation about our communications was not very clear. He asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to believe that our approach was serious. We wished to know what could be done to improve the situation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had said the situation was not normal and could be improved (the Secretary had not said so). How could it be improved and how far would the West go? What did we mean when we said the activities of certain agencies could be changed? <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> was not the principal question. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said we agreed the situation was abnormal and until Germany was reunited, we agreed on a number of things, such as reunification at some time, free elections at some time and a peace treaty at some time. He suggested we analyze the situation of Berlin. There were things to say on both sides. How could 10,000 Western troops be a threat? Were they a political threat to the USSR? If so, this could be examined.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had mentioned political, military, propaganda and economic matters. He wanted to know what we had in mind.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said we wanted to know what worried the Russians.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_796" n="796" facs="0821"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked if he had not said enough already. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he had not done so specifically.</p>
<p>The Secretary said we could make progress if we could go forward with the Soviets admitting that we had rights flowing from the war which we retained and to examine matters within that framework. Within these limits we could talk about improvements. The Soviets wanted us to give up our rights.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> admitted we had rights that grew out of the war but said that 14 years had passed and certain changes had taken place in Germany. The West does not attach importance to these changes.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that speaking frankly and for himself, we wanted the Soviets to reaffirm our rights of access and the rights of the West Berliners to their own form of life. What he thought the Soviets had a right to expect from us was to examine Berlin to see if it is a political or military threat to the Soviets. Ten thousand troops were only symbolic. We were prepared to look at the propaganda and subversive aspects.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that it was impossible to separate the political and military aspects. The occupation regime itself and the presence of troops was itself a political factor.</p>
<p>The Secretary inquired whether the Soviet troops in East Germany influenced the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said if the Secretary insisted on this kind of talk he would have to raise the question of U.S. troops in the Federal Republic. He suggested they confine the subject of discussion.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> disputed what he had said.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that his remarks were too general.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> inquired what was of first importance.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the occupational regime and the presence of Western troops was of primary importance.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> pointed out we had said we could not change that.</p>
<p>The Secretary observed that the Soviets wanted us to give up our rights. What did they offer in exchange? He suggested we talk upon the basis of the maintenance of Western rights.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said the presence of troops was of no military threat. So far as occupation was concerned, we were committed to that until Germany was reunified. The point of substance was whether or not we could make things easier for one another.</p>
<p>The Secretary said we desired to lessen tension for a temporary period.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked the Secretary to be specific. The Secretary said we could talk within the framework of maintaining our rights and retaining our troops, although the numbers of troops <pb xml:id="pg_797" n="797" facs="0822"/>could be reviewed. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested we look at the military and political aspects. The military were not a threat. He could see the possibility of a political threat.</p>
<p>The Secretary pointed out this worked both ways.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that whether there were 100 or 10,000 troops was not important and the presence of any troops was of significance. From a military point of view and in looking at the possibility of a military threat, the more troops we had in Berlin the better from the Soviet point of view, although they did not like to see this.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> observed that this then was the end of the idea that the three power troops were any military threat.</p>
<p>The Secretary pointed out that our troops were in Berlin only to give the Berliners assurance that they could continue to live as they wanted to live. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> himself had said this and we agreed with it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> denied he had made such a statement. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said we did not need troops from a military point of view but kept them to maintain an occupational regime.</p>
<p>The Secretary asked if the Soviets wanted our troops out so that they could influence West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said they did not want any interference from anyone in the life of West Berlin. No one could determine the internal system in the presence of foreign troops.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> pointed out that these troops were an insurance against incidents.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked why we kept troops if we were not worried about internal order in West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked if this meant that we wished to keep the present order unchanged. If so, this meant to maintain a constant threat.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> pointed out that Berlin was an island and this was the reason for our troops. The Berliners wanted them as a tangible sign that we would do what we said we would do.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he had a practical suggestion to make. We could meet on Monday and discuss what could be done to relieve Soviet fears and political tension in the context of Western maintenance of their rights and their troops. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should also listen to our complaints.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked him not to raise questions of ideology.</p>
<p>The Secretary agreed.</p>
<p>It was agreed to meet at the Soviet villa at 3:30 p.m. on Monday, June 1.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Activities in Berlin</p>
<p>1. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> said he thought we should evaluate the importance to us of our activities in Berlin that are offensive to the Soviets. Any yielding of our positions in Berlin should be clearly balanced by the Soviets’ granting something more than the rights we already possess. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> thought it would be hard for us to work in Berlin with any general restraint placed on our activities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s ideas, if followed through to their conclusion, were “chilling.” The Secretary said that this subject would be discussed at today’s private meeting with the Soviets.<note n="1" xml:id="d346fn1">See <ref target="#d348">Document 348</ref>.</note> He noted that at the Sunday meeting at his villa<note n="2" xml:id="d346fn2"><persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName>, and others at 5 p.m. May 31 to discuss Western and Communist intelligence activities in Berlin and, in particular, the two papers referred to in <ref target="#d348fn1">footnote 1, Document 348</ref>. No record of this meeting beyond the notation in the chronology has been found. (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1362, Chronology for May 30 and May 31)</note> there had been a detailed discussion of our activities <pb xml:id="pg_799" n="799" facs="0824"/>in Berlin. In this connection he stated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> will be coming to Geneva from Berlin tomorrow.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Approach by <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> Representatives</p>
<p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that representatives of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> had approached Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> this morning asking that he clarify for them certain legal points made by the Secretary in his presentations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said, had properly stated that he was unable to receive the East German representatives.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">East German Attacks on Western Delegations</p>
<p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> called attention to a pamphlet referred to in today’s <hi rend="italic">Journal de Geneve</hi> which apparently was improperly distributed by the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> through Maison de la Presse and which attacked the Western Delegations. It was noted that the West Germans have made representations on this matter to Bern.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Tactics for Today’s Meeting</p>
<p>4. At today’s meeting of the Deputies<note n="3" xml:id="d346fn3">See <ref target="#d347">Document 347</ref>.</note> there will be a discussion of the statement prepared for the Secretary on Berlin in which Communist charges of improper U.S. activities in Berlin are refuted by citations of Communist activities inimical to the West. The Secretary indicated his approval of discussing the paper with our allies but not giving copies to them.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> suggested that the three Western Foreign Ministers rotate the responsibility of keeping <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> informed of the restricted sessions and the Secretary indicated his approval. The Secretary said that at today’s private meeting he thought it important to refute <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s charges that Western activities in Berlin are a danger to East Berlin. In response to the Secretary’s inquiry, Mr. Bundy indicated that our data on Communist activities could be used without compromising sources. Mr. Bundy suggested that it might be desirable to avoid going into too much detail on intelligence activities in Berlin lest we open ourselves up to a Communist suggestion that there be a general agreement to stop all such activities. He thought that we could show in capsule form that the East is doing much more than we in the intelligence and espionage field. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said that he thought that in these meetings we should constantly keep going back to a discussion of Berlin within the framework of the Western Plan.<note n="4" xml:id="d346fn4">Reference is to the May 14 Western Peace Plan; see <ref target="#d295fn1">footnote 1, Document 295</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said <pb xml:id="pg_800" n="800" facs="0825"/>that a meeting of the Western Four at the French Villa had been arranged for 11:30 this morning<note n="5" xml:id="d346fn5">In a very brief report on this meeting the U.S. Delegation noted that it was agreed that <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> would “spell out” Western complaints about undesirable activities in East Berlin and press <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to be more specific about his complaints on the dangerous situation in West Berlin. (<gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 153 from Geneva, June 1; Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/6–159)</note> and the Secretary indicated his agreement.</p>
<p>[Here follow paragraphs 5 and 6 on unrelated subjects.]</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Berlin</p>
<p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> cited a telegram from Berlin,<note n="6" xml:id="d346fn6">Telegram 1022 from Berlin, May 30, noted that recent statements by <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> and other East German officials had stressed the free city of Berlin proposal, which seemed to indicate that the Soviet Union wanted to sever West Berlin’s ties with the Federal Republic. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.00/5–3059)</note> expressing the view that the Soviets appear to be primarily interested in the relationship of Berlin and the Federal Republic. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> thought that we should give careful study to the possibility that the Soviets might make a satisfactory arrangement on access to Berlin while attempting to prepare the way for severing connections between the Federal Republic and West Berlin. In this connection Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> thought that we might study the possibility of the three occupying powers’ removing the suspense order which prevents West Berlin from being the tenth German <hi rend="italic">land.</hi> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> cited a report<note n="7" xml:id="d346fn7">Not further identified.</note> that <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> had said present German civilian access to Berlin is a question to be regulated by the Germans working under the Four Powers. The Secretary commented that the West Germans endorsed the idea of a German commission, provided it is composed of representatives of the East and West Berlin city governments and not of representatives from the Federal Republic and the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Press Reaction to Conference</p>
<p>8. Noting that the press has picked up references by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> to the “Free City” proposal of the Soviets for Berlin, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said that Western use of Soviet terminology is giving the impression that all the Soviets want in Berlin is a free city. He asked that different phraseology be used. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> continued that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> gave the impression in his speech Saturday<note n="8" xml:id="d346fn8">See <ref target="#d344">Document 344</ref>.</note> that we are willing to make a number of unilateral concessions to stay in Berlin. As far as the propaganda field is concerned, this kind of talk is having a bad effect on the morale of <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> employees. Since <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss>, according to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName>, indicates to many Berliners U.S. presence in Berlin even more graphically than U.S. troops, there is a feeling that if <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> goes the U.S. will go too. The Secretary thought it would be desirable at the next plenary to go on the offensive <pb xml:id="pg_801" n="801" facs="0826"/>and point out what the East is doing in respect to propaganda and to comment on the role of <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> in West Berlin. He agreed that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had gone pretty far on Saturday in his speech. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> stated that the passages in the speech on possible discussion of Western propaganda activities in West Berlin had been kept in despite the advice of <persName corresp="#p_HPF1">Hancock</persName> and Rumbold.</p>

<item>Tentative Conclusions on Tactical and Other Conference Problems</item>
</list>
<p>The following recommendations were reached by the Four Power Coordinating Group:</p>
<p>1. The three participating Western Foreign Ministers in private talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will rotate the task of getting in touch with <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von <pb xml:id="pg_802" n="802" facs="0827"/>Brentano</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> to keep the West German Delegation informed. In view of the French-British dinner tonight, the United States will undertake the task today.</p>
<p>2. At this afternoon’s private meeting the Western Powers will attempt to avoid having the discussion revolve further around the question of why the Soviets desire to change the basic status of West Berlin but instead concentrate on presentation of mutual complaints about “undesirable activities” in East and West Berlin. The Western Foreign Ministers should have in mind the desirability of avoiding seeming to admit guilt on our part as a trading point against some arrangements on access.</p>
<p>3. Since the Western correspondents are tending to pick up the Soviet phrase “Free City” as a description for the Soviet proposals on Berlin, Western spokesmen should avoid adding fuel to this tendency to use a term with rather inviting connotations. One possibility suggested was “Plan for a Third Germany”.</p>
<p>4. After some discussion, it was agreed that it would be undesirable to raise the question of Western complaints on access this afternoon. An effort should be made instead to concentrate on complaints about the situation in Berlin itself.</p>
<p>5. If it seems appropriate in the light of the discussion this afternoon, the question of a Conciliation Commission for Berlin might be raised. However, if this is done, the initial suggestion should be limited to one for a Commission to be constituted solely by the Four Powers.</p>
<p>6. It was agreed that it would probably be desirable to have a further plenary session by the middle of this week, but it was felt that the timing could be best determined after this afternoon’s discussion. At such plenary session, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> would give a speech which he has prepared commenting on a number of points raised during the first weeks of the Conference.</p>
<p>7. In a statement which he said he wished to make in order to bring U.S. views to the attention of the other country representatives present, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out that we considered <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> to be a major Western asset in Berlin. Since the time of the blockade, it had been identified in a unique way with free world resistance to Soviet attempts to end the city’s freedom, and its demise would have great symbolic significance. Hence we did not consider <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> a barterable object. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> supported these views.</p>

</list>
<p>The meeting started informally with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s reference to the fact that in these informal meetings there was no Chairman.</p>
<p>The Secretary then said that he wished to speak on the subject of subversive activities and inflammatory propaganda originating in East Berlin and directed against West Berlin and the Federal Republic. He referred to the campaign of vilification which was being conducted by the official East German press and radio during the course of the conference. He said attacks were not confined to West German personalities and that he himself had not been omitted from attention in the slanderous and scurrilous attack. He then said that he would read a statement in which he would cite chapter and verse, adding that he could amplify if necessary and that it was his intention in a later plenary session to repeat his statement for the benefit of the public.</p>
<p>He then read the two attached statements<note n="1" xml:id="d348fn1">Neither printed. The first was a four-page paper entitled “Talking Points on Communist Activities in East Berlin,” May 31, and the second was a five-page paper that outlined intelligence agencies in East Germany and kidnappings of West Berliners.</note> seriatim, interpolating twice during the reading. His first interpolation was to read the text of <pb xml:id="pg_804" n="804" facs="0829"/><persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName>’s telegram of May 26, No. 36 from Berlin.<note n="2" xml:id="d348fn2">This telegram transmitted East German radio broadcasts that attacked Western leaders. (Department of State, Central Files, 962B.40/5–2659)</note> His second interpolation was to read certain extracts from the compilation of attacks on the Federal Republic and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> in particular in the official <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> newspaper.</p>
<p>In concluding, the Secretary said that his statement supports the contention that there is a massive effort originating in East Berlin to increase tensions both between East Berlin and West Berlin and between the Soviet Union and the West. He said that we were willing to do our share to relax tensions but he thought that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would agree that it was not possible to lay all the blame for tensions on the doorstep of West Berlin.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, who had sat stony-faced through the recital, seemed to a degree at a loss as to how best to reply. He opened by saying that our people who had worked on these papers had obviously done much work. As to these actions and statements which the Secretary ascribed to the East Berlin press and radio and certain <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> authorities, he was not in a position to speak for them. It was better that they should answer for themselves. He could not refrain, however, from recalling the old military axiom that the best defense is a good offense.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued that he did not want to suggest, however, in talking about West Berlin some were on the offense and some on the defense. He then asked rhetorically whether we should take this road down which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> was attempting to lead us. Should <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> himself prepare and similarly read material from broadcasts and newspapers in West Berlin and the Federal Republic about the Soviets? Then we would see on whose side are the most striking facts. The question was should we stoop so low or act as statesmen and seek to reach an understanding. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he had no material at hand at the moment but promised that when he collected it it would be several times longer than Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s list.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> concluded by saying that if. we are to deal with these questions then when we summarize our talk on West Berlin we could say that both East and West Berlin should assume certain obligations not to do things to increase tensions. In conclusion he said that questions of propaganda and subversion were not one of the principal questions to be considered. This problem ranked in fourth or fifth or even sixth place.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that he had raised this matter because it had been <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> himself who had first raised the question and in public.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that they do attach importance to it, to which the Secretary rejoined, “So do we.”</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_805" n="805" facs="0830"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that the Soviets had raised the matter in connection with the non-tolerance of subversive actions originating in Berlin but that it could be inferred from the Secretary’s statement that he intended to broaden the subject of discussion to questions of ideology in which case no solution would be possible for any of them. The Secretary replied that he had raised nothing whatsoever of an ideological nature. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said in previous meetings that there was a risk of incidents in Berlin. If, as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> now says, this question rates only fourth, fifth or sixth place, then it were better to consider the more important areas where the risk of incidents existed.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the main question and the main risk of incidents lies in the presence of Western troops in West Berlin. There is danger in the occupation status. Incidents arising from the presence of the troops are different from what might be “improper” broadcasts. It was true that there had been no incidents recently but everyone knows that an explosion is preceded by silence. It was necessary that the conference come to an agreement. He asked if the discussion could not now be returned to the main road on the exchange of views on the main problems. He reminded the Secretary that on Saturday night<note n="3" xml:id="d348fn3">See <ref target="#d344">Document 344</ref>.</note> he had asked for an explanation of the Secretary’s point of view on the matters we were discussing.</p>
<p>The Secretary rejoined that they had been on a bypath to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had led them. Possibly the entire subject of subversion and propaganda should now be forgotten as of no importance. The Secretary then went on to say that on the main question we are prepared to talk within limits. These limits are, first, that we will not give up our rights, including the presence of our troops in Berlin, though it would be possible to talk about ceilings on them. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> himself had agreed that they had no military significance. They were in Berlin as protection for the life of West Berlin. Secondly, the Secretary said we will not recognize the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. The third point is the question of access. On this we have an agreement with the Russians and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that he assumed from what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said in recent days the Soviets did not intend to act unilaterally with respect to this agreement. Within these limits we are ready and anxious to talk with a view to reducing differences and tensions.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that there was constant repetition of the formula that the West would not give up its rights, but what was meant when they spoke of changes while retaining the rights. He pled for frankness.</p>
<p>The Secretary said we have made a fair proposal for all of Berlin which is a property apart from either East or West Germany. The occupying powers in effect hold it in trust for a future reunited Germany. We <pb xml:id="pg_806" n="806" facs="0831"/>have rights there which the Soviets admit. You have a responsibility in East Berlin. You admit that Germany should be united and Berlin established as its capital. Nevertheless you say that East Berlin is now the capital of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> and it is impermissible to talk about it. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he had nothing to add to what he had already said concerning the Western all-Berlin proposal. East Berlin is not Soviet territory and the Soviets do not intend to reintroduce an occupation regime.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> interjected that after two weeks’ talk on Germany we had now been discussing Berlin but all that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wants to talk about is West Berlin. If this is the fact then here is the West’s position on West Berlin. We intend to keep our present position in West Berlin both juridically and in so far as troops are concerned. If there is anything that worries the Soviets we are prepared to discuss it and see what can be done. We are agreed that the garrisons pose no military threat. Their presence is symbolic and psychological.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> went on to say that there appeared to be a misunderstanding, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said that the West had not made its position or proposals clear but the Western Powers have nothing more in mind than what they have already said. They have been frank and open and are prepared to look at whatever troubles the Soviets.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked for further elaboration and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> replied if there is no settlement on Greater Berlin then the three Western Powers will keep their rights in West Berlin with its autonomous regime and maintain their troops there. West Berlin is economically linked to the Federal Republic and must remain so. We have a Four Power agreement with the Soviets on access for both civilian movements and the garrisons. We think we must keep all of these and see what changes in practice are possible to meet whatever may be the Soviet concerns. Ceilings, for example, might be considered for the troops. Means of avoiding an East-West Berlin war of subversion and propaganda could be discussed. On the matter of access no question really arises since there is an agreement in force and established practice. We think, however, that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> himself has in mind making changes with respect to access and at one time he mentioned a possible Soviet agreement with the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. We are ready to consider and examine whatever the Soviets want to put up.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> came back with the statement that what <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said made it appear that the West would propose no changes in West Berlin in fact. They wanted their troops to remain and then they wanted guarantees on the access routes. He said, “You speak of meeting our wishes but in actuality you want to gain further advantages for yourselves.”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> replied that we are asking nothing. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said that we sought no change and that was perfectly true. Until Germany can be reunified there was no reason why we should abandon <pb xml:id="pg_807" n="807" facs="0832"/>our own rights and duties. West Berlin admittedly must remain sui generis until Germany was reunified. Why then should the three Western Powers abandon their position in this interim period? They had asked no new commitments. Nevertheless <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seemed to desire to make some change but we were in the dark as to what it was or why. When we are told we will look at it. Meanwhile we are satisfied with the present access situation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then attempted further to elicit from the French Foreign Minister what changes in the situation he visualized. He said that the situation of West Berlin was abnormal and could not be maintained; that the Soviets had come to Geneva to reach an understanding with us but that everything so far said by the West was vague and nebulous and the West’s apparent satisfaction with the present situation was far removed from reality.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> reiterated that what the Soviets proposed with respect to West Berlin was unacceptable but that we will consider whatever further proposals the Soviets may have in mind.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> why he considered the present access arrangements unsatisfactory or abnormal and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied, “Because the Soviets still exercise outlived occupation functions.”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> if he was right in understanding that in this respect <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> referred exclusively to the access rights of the Western troops in West Berlin and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> gave no reply.</p>
<p>The Secretary interjected that with respect to access the problem arose when <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> spoke on November 10<note n="4" xml:id="d348fn4">See <ref target="#d24">Document 24</ref>.</note> and followed it up with the first note<note n="5" xml:id="d348fn5">See <ref target="#d72">Document 72</ref>.</note> on the subject which stated that on May 27 control over the access routes would be turned over to the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. This was what has created present acute tensions. We agreed to sit down and seek means of relieving these tensions but now Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is suggesting that we are asking concessions in order to cooperate in removing tensions which the Soviets artificially created. It looks as though the Soviets wanted to take advantage of us. He then said soberly that he hoped the Soviets would not consider cutting off our access to West Berlin for the sake of their future relations with the United States and with many other countries. He concluded by urging that we see how the question of access could be improved and thereby lower tensions.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then made his first intervention, saying that he did not consider that we were particularly satisfied with the present situation. The position of Berlin is abnormal and will remain so until German reunification. The problem is to see how the situation can be improved.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_808" n="808" facs="0833"/>
<p>We for our part are ready to discuss the military side to prove that Western troops are purely symbolic. We are also willing to discuss propaganda and subversion and we are willing that West Berlin should continue to be politically neutral and no threat to another state (the Secretary interjected, “On a reciprocal basis,” which amendment Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> accepted). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> went on to say that over the last ten years the situation with respect to West Berlin had worked pretty well on the basis of our agreements with the Soviets and that it “was not consistent with the honor and dignity of a great nation to try and change an agreement unilaterally.”</p>
<p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that with respect to the free city proposal and the question of guarantees, the Soviet Delegation had now developed its ideas and reduced them to a document. Single copies of a proposed protocol on this matter<note n="6" xml:id="d348fn6">Document 349.</note> were then brought in and distributed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated that it had been prepared after full consultation with the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. He added that he presumed that other Ministers would wish to study it before commenting on it.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had touched on three points, the military aspects, the subversive aspect and the matter of free access but this was done in very general terms. Exactly what changes did Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> have in mind specifically?</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he had really nothing to add to what he had already said. He inquired what are the Soviets’ complaints? He repeated that we would be willing to consider troop and equipment ceilings and on the political side evidence of tension created in Berlin by propaganda and subversion. He then said that there was one matter which had not been mentioned in our discussions which could be discussed and this was the question of refugees (<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> neither then nor later commented on this remark). On access, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> continued, there is some unfinished business going back to the 1949 agreement.<note n="7" xml:id="d348fn7">For text of the final communiqué of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers, June 20, 1949, see <ref target="frus1949v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 1062–1065.</note> It seemed possible that supplementary agreements could be worked out here which would avoid future disputes and arguments.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued his old tactic of commenting that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s statement was far from clear. He then repeated that the danger of incidents in West Berlin comes from the presence of Western troops there. Whether they were ten or twenty thousand or even only five thousand they represented the real danger.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> argued that the presence of Western troops in fact are a safeguard for peace and confessed his failure to understand <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s <pb xml:id="pg_809" n="809" facs="0834"/>reasoning. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> went on to point out that the allied troops in Trieste made for stability until a political settlement had been reached. He had no doubt that kidnappings in West Berlin would soar overnight were there no Western troops there. He then said that even a modest agreement arising from this conference could prove the turn of the tide in East-West relations. Then the four Heads of Government could go on to consider the big problems such as disarmament and European security.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made some noncommittal almost inaudible comment.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that we had offered comprehensive proposals to deal with the whole German problem and that the Soviets had rejected them. He reminded Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that there had been no incidents in West Berlin except for some minor ones on the routes of access.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he agreed that we were both talking about a temporary settlement for Berlin pending the reunification of Germany.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> then said that he had glanced at the paper distributed a few minutes before and, in connection with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement that Western troops in West Berlin caused tensions, had been struck by the Soviet proposal that the four occupying powers plus the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> form a commission to control the operation of the agreement for West Berlin. He asked what greater possible cause of tension could be devised than such a commission interfering daily in all of West Berlin’s affairs.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the commission’s role would be observation and that interference in domestic affairs was contrary to Soviet policy. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> commented that it was really a commission designed to interfere so as to ensure no interference.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> if he had had a chance to read the paper. He replied that he had read it three times and had found no more virtue in it on the third reading than on the first. He suggested that all study it overnight and meet privately again the following day.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> with a straight face suggested that the Ministers meet again informally and privately but add the Germans, or alternatively meet in plenary session. There was considerable discussion in which the Secretary made clear that the East Germans would not sit in his house and likewise that he had never agreed to private meetings with the Germans present.</p>
<p>After some further discussion it was agreed that there would be held a plenary session at 3:30 at the Palais and a private session of the four Foreign Ministers at Villa Greta at 9 o’clock the same evening at which it was agreed the Soviet protocol proposal would be considered. Meanwhile it was agreed to keep its contents confidential.</p>

<p rend="center">PROTOCOL ON THE GUARANTEES OF THE STATUS OF THE FREE CITY OF WEST BERLIN</p>
<p>The Governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the United States of America and of the Republic of France for the purpose of ensuring the observance of the status of the Free City of West Berlin have agreed on the following:—</p>
<p rend="center">Article 1</p>
<p>The States Parties to this Protocol jointly guarantee the status of the Free City of West Berlin.</p>
<p rend="center">Article 2</p>

<p>The presence of the said military contingents on the territory of the Free City of West Berlin should in no way be considered as occupation of that territory.</p>
<p>The military contingents shall not interfere in the internal affairs of the Free City of West Berlin.</p>
<p>The legal status of the military contingents shall be determined by a special arrangement between the four States Parties to this Protocol and the authorities of the Free City of West Berlin.</p>

<p>The States Parties to the Protocol agree to establish a Permanent International Commission composed of the representatives of the States Parties to the Protocol and of the German Democratic Republic.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_811" n="811" facs="0836"/>
<p>The functions of the said Commission shall be to supervise the observance of the status of the Free City of West Berlin and the ensuring of the City’s independence. The Commission shall pay a special attention to the observance of the status and, in particular, to that which pertains to the demilitarisation of the Free City, to the prohibition to carry out there hostile activities directed against any State and also to the non-interference in the internal life of the Free City of West Berlin.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 58. For the President from the Secretary.</p>
<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>Sorry to say there is little to report on today’s session. Because of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement in plenary session that propaganda and subversive activities from West Berlin created dangers for East Germans and Soviets, I took occasion to point out in great detail subversive activities carried out from East Berlin which made any activities from West Berlin look puny. Also quoted from juicy bits recorded from recent East German radio broadcasts which alleged <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> and I engaged jointly in homosexual activities with even worse references to <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName>, which I think shook <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> up a bit. His reply was that these activities East Germans were really of 4th, 5th or 6th relative importance and arrangements might be found whereby both East and West German activities could be softened. When both <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> later indicated perhaps some reciprocal arrangement possible, he began losing interest in subject and we may hear very little more about it.</p>
<p>Near end of meeting, he handed us typewritten suggested draft protocol<note n="1" xml:id="d350fn1">Document 349.</note> for West Germany [<hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi>], text of which being sent Department, which obviously completely unacceptable but on which discussion deferred until tomorrow. Tensions created by Russian threats regarding access rights to Berlin being transferred to East Germans discussed briefly and background laid for further discussion.</p>
<p>Sorry nothing more constructive to report. This is still a waiting game with some evidence that Russians so eager for summit that acceptable modus vivendi for West Germany possible.</p>
<p>London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> article indicating <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> near end his tenure as Foreign Minister causing much speculation among delegations.<note n="2" xml:id="d350fn2">For text of this article, see <hi rend="italic">The Times,</hi> June 1, 1959, p. 10.</note> It has placed him most uncomfortable position but he has not discussed it with me.</p>

<p rend="center">FULL DELEGATION MEETING</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic">Tactical Matters</hi></p>
<p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> reported that he had briefed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d351fn1">No further record of this briefing has been found.</note> last night on yesterday’s private meeting. He said he had left no documents with <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> although he had promised to give him a copy of the protocol<note n="2" xml:id="d351fn2">Document 349.</note> that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> introduced at yesterday’s private meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he was disturbed by press leaks about the private sessions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> thought that the West Germans may have disclosed to the press what the Secretary intended to say yesterday about Communist activities in East Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> continued that as far as the plenary today was concerned, the “so-called Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName>” and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> would speak. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> has what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> described as a good speech rounding up conference developments. The Secretary noted a protocol problem concerning the chairmanship. He said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wants to be in the chair today even though a private session was held at his residence yesterday. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he thought the chairmanship of the plenary sessions should rotate solely on the basis of prior plenary sessions without regard to private meetings. The Secretary indicated agreement.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic">Possible Limitation on Troops in Berlin</hi></p>
<p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> called attention to a Berlin telegram (to Geneva 54)<note n="3" xml:id="d351fn3">Dated June 1, it transmitted General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>’s views on the impact of limiting the number of Allied troops in West Berlin. After noting that no matter how many troops were in the city, Berlin was militarily indefensible, <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> stressed that the Soviet interest was only a “political gimmick” to permit them further control on access to the city. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.0221/6–159)</note> containing a memorandum by General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> concerning the dangers to free access inherent in any limitation on troop strength in Berlin. The Secretary thought General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>’s point was well taken and that any limitation on Western troop strength might make possible undesirable Soviet inspection activities. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> thought the Soviets would wish to avoid establishing a precedent in Berlin which might work against them at some future time in respect to general <pb xml:id="pg_814" n="814" facs="0839"/>disarmament arrangements. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> said that the Soviets do not want the West to have rights in East Berlin; therefore, if they pursue the matter and insist on limitations in West Berlin we must insist on a ceiling for forces in East Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> pointed out, however, that the Soviets could withdraw a few miles into East Germany and then willingly submit to inspection in East Berlin.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic">Terminology of Meetings</hi></p>
<p>3. Mr. Boerner reported that last night the Soviet briefing officer had stated that the private meetings of the Big Four were “unofficial” meetings designed to speed up the work of the conference, adding that the official meetings are those attended by the six delegations at the Palais. The Secretary noted that we are not using the term “restricted” meetings which implied meeting with the two German adviser delegations and that there are in our view two types of meetings; i.e. the plenary, and “informal” or “private” sessions.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic">Assessment of Berlin Situation</hi></p>
<p>4. At the invitation of the Secretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> gave an assessment of the current situation in Berlin. Berlin morale, he said, is “amazingly good.” He noted that after <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s attack Saturday on <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss>, the morale of <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> employees had improved and many had informed the Director that they would not resign at this time to take other jobs as they had planned. The attitude of the city in general is good. Underneath there is a certain nervousness, however; the trust the Berliners show in the U.S. is almost embarrassing. Berliners, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> continued, have three paramount concerns; (1) that if Berlin be made a free city, it not have its own currency but remain tied monetarily to West Germany; (2) that the U.S. not agree to any limitation on troop strength but retain their sovereign right to decide what troop strength to keep in Berlin; and (3) that we not give up <gloss target="#t_RIAS1">RIAS</gloss> or agree to any limitations on propaganda activities. Berliners feel that to do so would be the beginning of the curtailment of their right of free speech. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> continued that Berliners are apprehensive lest agreements be reached which balance out rights in East and West Berlin; their feeling is that they would not come out even since they are free and East Berlin is not. In response to an inquiry by the Secretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> said that there has been improvement economically this year over last year due largely to aid furnished by the West German Government and by large West German concerns to their Berlin subsidiaries.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_815" n="815" facs="0840"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic">Activities of Working Group</hi></p>
<p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> said that the working group met yesterday and discussed formulae concerning access to Berlin.<note n="4" xml:id="d351fn4">Documentation on the working group, which had been meeting in Bonn to discuss specifics of the agreed tripartite contingency plan (see <ref target="#d255">Document 255</ref>), is in Department of State, Central File 762.00.</note> He said that there was a consensus that it was premature to try to reach agreement on specific language. It was agreed that each delegation would refine its own language and have it ready for such time as the matter might be under discussion by the Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic">President’s Press Conference</hi></p>
<p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> noted that the President would be holding a press conference tomorrow and said that he planned to formulate a series of questions and farm them out among the U.S. delegation for preparation of answers.<note n="5" xml:id="d351fn5">The questions and suggested answers were transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 164 from Geneva, June 2 at 9 p.m. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 396.1–GE/6–259)</note> The Secretary interjected that he thought the President could play a very important role in determining the course of the conference by what he said tomorrow and he thought that we should frame our comments to the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House as recommendations rather than as suggestions.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic">Press Backgrounder by Secretary</hi></p>
<p>7. The Secretary agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> that it might be wise to schedule his backgrounder for American correspondents for Thursday rather than tomorrow in the light of the President’s press conference and a background news conference that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> intends to give on Wednesday.<note n="6" xml:id="d351fn6">The transcript of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s backgrounder for U.S. correspondents at 10 a.m. on June 4, in which he stated that no agreement had been reached on withdrawal of troops, screening of refugees, or curtailment of intelligence activities in Berlin, was transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 175 from Geneva, June 4. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 396.1–GE/6–459) For a transcript of the President’s press conference at 10:30 a.m. on June 3, in which he stated that progress at Geneva had been insufficient to warrant a summit conference, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>, 1959,</hi> pp. 425–435. A summary of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s press conference on June 3, in which he indicated that the West was considering troop reductions and screening of refugees and that Berlin should be dealt with in a report to the Heads of Government and at a summit meeting in July, is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1366.</note></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Possible Press Briefing on Communist Activities in East Berlin</hi></p>
<p>8. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> suggested that in view of the intense press interest in our presentation on Communist intelligence activities in East Berlin, it might be desirable to give the press on a background basis a sanitized version of our data on this subject. The Secretary thought that this might <pb xml:id="pg_816" n="816" facs="0841"/>be a good idea since he said he did not intend to use publicly this material unless the Soviets return to the charge that Western activities in West Berlin were a danger to East Berlin. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, supported by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, thought it would not be desirable to do this. He thought we ran the danger of being accused of leaking information about the private sessions.</p>
<p>[Here follows paragraph 9 on an unrelated subject.]</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">London Times’ Article on <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName></hi></p>
<p>10. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> said he had learned from British sources that yesterday’s London <hi rend="italic">Times’</hi> article about <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s possible resignation had been stimulated by Duncan Sandys.</p>

<p>I spoke to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> in regard to his having raised the refugee problem in Berlin as a possible area in which we could make a concession to the Russians. I told him that inasmuch as the Russians had not raised the question, it would be better to leave it alone since there was no point in our offering concessions on points about which the Russians had not complained. He said he would not himself bring the matter up again.</p>
<p>I also told him of the difficulties that might be involved if we reached an agreement with the Russians on the limitation of troops in Berlin since this would at once give the Soviets or the East Germans an opportunity of examining everything in connection with our convoys or personnel going by air as a necessary check on our troop numbers. He agreed that this was a valid point and that if we decided to limit troops this would be done by a declaration on our part rather than any agreement.</p>

<p>I took up with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> the possibility of the three Western Foreign Ministers going to Berlin this Saturday for a very brief look around and not for the purpose of making any statements.

He planned to do this between the time of the end of this conference and a possible Summit Conference. I told him that this was entirely tentative and he said he would like to think it over until tomorrow. (Subsequently, I discussed the matter with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> and his feeling was that for us to go at this juncture might be seriously misinterpreted, and that we would do better to wait until the end of the conference.)</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>I believe the time has come when you could give us a very real assist at your press conference Wednesday<note n="1" xml:id="d355fn1">June 3.</note> in connection with our negotiations. Up until now, there has not been a single indication from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> with respect to any of our proposals or with respect to the modification of his own proposals which would appear to justify a summit meeting. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has made threatening noises from Albania<note n="2" xml:id="d355fn2">For extracts from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speeches at Tirana, May 26 and 31, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting,</hi> pp. 303–305 and 306–310.</note> in his references to our negotiations which have been far from helpful. Extracts from these statements are being conveyed to Jim <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
<p>If you could make it clear during your press conference that developments to date in Geneva do not encourage you to feel a summit conference has been justified, this would, I think, give a real impetus to the possibility of our securing some progress on the Berlin situation which, <pb xml:id="pg_819" n="819" facs="0844"/>in turn, might justify such a conference. The private talks to date have gotten us very little further than the public talks except that I think the Russians are now beginning to believe that we will not give up our occupation rights or access rights. A statement by you along the lines suggested in a separate telegram Andy <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> is sending Jim <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d355fn3">See <ref target="#d351fn5">footnote 5, Document 351</ref>.</note> might well force them to discussions within the limitations we have set.</p>

<head>“Secret</head>
<item>“Dear Chris:</item>
<item>“Thank you for your periodic reports. I saw the press stories out of London concerning <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>, as well as <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s denial of their authenticity. It is my impression that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> has grown very much in maturity and ability in his job. Personally I would hate to see him transferred. Such things are barred from public comment by us, but I am hopeful that the reports are erroneous. It was unfortunate that such gossip should be published at this particular time.</item>
<item>“I think that your rebuttal of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s charge that West Berlin propaganda and subversive activities create danger for the East Germans and the Soviets was both necessary and effective. Regarding <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s typewritten draft protocol for West Germany,<note n="1" xml:id="d357fn1">Document 349.</note> it is a typical Soviet trick to advance a proposal that is completely unacceptable. They cannot conceive of a conference that must first of all be a test of patience and endurance.

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Discussion of Western and Soviet Positions on Berlin</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> opened the discussion by referring to the draft protocol<note n="1" xml:id="d358fn1">Document 349.</note> which the Soviets had submitted at the last meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d358fn2">See <ref target="#d348">Document 348</ref>.</note> He would speak frankly as there was no use having private talks unless we were prepared to be frank. Making clear that he was speaking for all three Western Powers, he said the Soviet document put forward proposals which the Western Powers had already clearly said were unacceptable and it put forward no new proposals. The Western objections were briefly as follows:</p>
<p>1. The document seemed to extinguish allied rights in Berlin which existed by right of conquest.</p>
<p>2. The proposal would establish a third state on Berlin soil.</p>
<p>3. There was nothing in the document about East Berlin, therefore, it was no solution to the Berlin problem.</p>
<p>4. It provided for the introduction of Soviet troops into West Berlin with no corresponding provision in regard to East Berlin.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_824" n="824" facs="0849"/>
<p>5. It associated the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> with the agreement by including them in the proposed international commission, giving the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> a kind of supervisory status and providing for reports to be submitted to it.</p>
<p>6. It made no provision for free political life and economic stability in West Berlin nor did it contain any provisions with regard to access. It also contravened the will of the West Berliners to which they had often given expression most recently in 1958.</p>
<p>7. The document constituted a wrong approach by putting forward something which we could not accept even as a basis for discussion. He realized that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said the same thing about the Western proposal.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said their document should be considered in connection with their proposals on West Berlin. The Soviet document related to guarantees. With respect to access, provision was made in the protocol for the conclusion of a special agreement on this question. He said the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was on the same footing as other powers since West Berlin was in the center of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He did not consider that the provision in the protocol regarding <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> participation should be considered a recognition of that government. This was a separate question but it was unjust to deny to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> the right of participation in the agreement. The Soviet proposal provided two alternatives with respect to Berlin, that is, there could either be the presence of troops of the four powers or of neutrals. He inquired whether there was anything unacceptable in the document.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said there were some things with which we could agree. We agreed our purpose was the right of West Berlin to choose its form of society. We agreed that free access was part of the necessary arrangement for a free way of life. We agreed that our occupation was symbolic and we also agreed that there could be a commission of some kind. These were elements on which we could negotiate. However, a protocol which envisaged equal <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> participation, which dealt only with West Berlin, and which brought Soviet troops to West Berlin furnished no basis for negotiation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked what kind of a commission we proposed.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said a commission was important but it was to implement certain arrangements between us. It was first necessary to agree on principles and then see how they could be carried out in practice. A question that always came between us was that of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. It was not possible to have a commission of the four of us and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed that the commission was not the important thing and that the main point was what kind of arrangement could be arrived at.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he agreed we should not start with the commission until we knew what it was to do. The Soviet protocol was based on premises that were unacceptable since it would start by wiping out our rights. We had made plain that we could not have those rights <pb xml:id="pg_825" n="825" facs="0850"/>extinguished unilaterally until there was agreement on the reunification of Germany. The framework had to be the rights that we now have. When <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> spoke of dangers we stated we were willing to talk about them. He said we also believed there were dangers to the people of West Berlin. If an agreement was carried out along the lines the Soviets proposed, we believed the people of West Berlin could be strangled. We had lived for some time with tensions—the present tensions that the Soviets had created. The position which the Western Powers had put forward today was a final one and we suggested that we start from this.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> had used the words “within the framework of our rights”. Could he give a definition of those rights?</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that the rights were clear and were part of the agreements we had with the Soviets. The elements of tension had been created by the Soviets saying they would turn over access routes to someone we did not recognize.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that tension was created by the presence of Western troops.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that for 10 years the Soviets had not referred to this as a danger. We had been prepared to talk in regard to Berlin and have presented a number of proposals in good faith. Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and the head of the Soviet Government had said that our proposals were not negotiable. We were equally frank in saying the Soviet proposals were non-negotiable. We were agreed on only one thing, namely, that Germany should be reunified. We should begin our talks on the basis of our troops remaining in Berlin and our having free access to that city. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> observed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> was now discussing the general question of Germany. He had thought we were discussing Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said we were discussing Berlin as part of our proposals. He had brought the matter up in connection with the subject of tensions.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Western Powers had not made any proposals to reduce tensions or to improve the situation. They had mentioned improvements but he did hot know what they had in mind. Could they submit in writing what they meant by “within the framework of our rights”?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said the Soviets had raised the question of Berlin on the ground of the dangers they saw there. The Western Powers were prepared to consider their views and proposals. First with respect to the views, he said he was not convinced by what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said of dangers as he had produced no proof. Nothing new had happened requiring drastic measures to prevent incidents. It was up to the Soviets to make proposals. The Western Powers were not completely negative and had included Berlin in their proposals. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had rejected these. The Western Powers had the Soviet paper which they could not take as a <pb xml:id="pg_826" n="826" facs="0851"/>basis for discussion. They had repeatedly said they were prepared to see what could be done on the basis that there was no possibility at this time of a solution of the German problem. He said they had put on paper what they thought were lines on which the Soviet worries could be discussed. He emphasized these were Soviet worries, not Western ones. He then read the Western document<note n="3" xml:id="d358fn3"><p>This proposal reads:</p>
<p>“1. There can be no modification of the rights of the Western powers in Berlin on the basis of which various agreements have been concluded with the Soviet Union. Among these rights are the right to maintain troops there and the right of unrestricted access to Berlin.</p>
<p>“2. Under certain conditions the Western powers would be prepared to declare their intention not to increase the present level of the forces stationed in Berlin.</p>
<p>“3. They would similarly be prepared to consider ways in which, in the greater Berlin area and while respecting fundamental rights and liberties, arrangements which might be made to avoid illegal or clandestine activities which might either disturb public order or seriously affect the interests of the different parties.</p>
<p>“4. If the Soviet Government wishes to modify certain of the procedures regarding the present access arrangements, the Western powers would be prepared to examine its proposals.</p>
<p>“5. The various arrangements which might be agreed to would continue in force until the reunification of Germany.” (<gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 64 from Geneva, June 3; Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/6–359)</p></note> and pointed out that the first paragraph answered the question <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had put with respect to rights. He pointed out that there were three paragraphs on which we were prepared to discuss certain points in order to meet Soviet views. One of these paragraphs dealt with the level of forces. Another dealt with such matters as agitation, subversion and espionage. Then there was the question of access. After reading the pertinent paragraph, he said it had been framed in this way since we did not know what the Soviets wanted. Free access already existed in two ways. The most important was the access for civilian needs, such as traffic in goods, post and telegraph, etc. This right was reaffirmed in 1949 and is under supervision by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> at the border point. In the second place, there was freedom of access for Western military needs which was covered by special agreements between the Western Powers and the Soviet Union. It was also covered or referred to in the <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> agreements<note n="4" xml:id="d358fn4">See <ref target="#d31fn5">footnote 5, Document 31</ref>.</note> in that the Soviets had not transferred this function to the East German authorities. The Soviets said they had no intention of interfering with these communications. The Western Powers did not know what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had in mind when he said he wished to change these arrangements. The last paragraph of the Western paper stated it would continue in force until German reunification. This was an idea which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> himself had expressed. These were ideas and not expressed in treaty language.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_827" n="827" facs="0852"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to make certain preliminary observations. We had stated our position and the Soviets had put forward theirs. He inquired how this document could be considered as a basis for negotiation. This was impossible because it was one-sided. They had come to Geneva to reach agreement on all questions, including Berlin. If this was the Western position the outlook was very gloomy.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he found Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remark very strange since in this document the West had made all of the concessions and there were none called for on the part of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> inquired what concessions were made.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> mentioned as an example that we gave up our right to increase our forces. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Soviets had been talking about reductions.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said we stated we could accept a limitation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said not one soldier was withdrawn—where was the concession?</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said we had the right to increase pur forces and were making a concession in offering to limit the number.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said we were worried about guarantees.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> denied this and said we were not worried.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said our only worry was that the Soviets might go back on their word.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that access was presently guaranteed. The Soviets wanted some change. We were prepared to examine their proposals.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Soviets wanted to give up their functions. We were worried about access. The Soviets were prepared to give guarantees on this subject. Some 14 years had passed and they wished to put things in order. The Soviets had no occupation rights but they fulfilled some functions regarding access.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said the Soviets had said they would take unilateral action to abolish their guarantees. We had protested this. Now the position was different in that he had not so far spoken of unilateral action. He had suggested that we look at the question of access which we were prepared to do but he was not specific. He merely said the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> existed.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was a substantial fact. With respect to unilateral action they had refrained so far from any such actions hoping they could reach agreement with the Western Powers. He would still like to hope but he could not understand when we represented paragraph 4 of our paper as a concession.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said we had a right at present to increase our troops.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said opinion differed on this. He did not see any willingness on the part of the Western Governments to facilitate a solution on a mutually acceptable basis.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_828" n="828" facs="0853"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked what he did not like about our proposals.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said it was not a question of changing a few words. What was important was the direction in which our document led. The presence of Western troops constituted the danger. The West had ignored Soviet worries and their position.</p>
<p>With respect to paragraph 3 he pointed out that East Berlin was a part of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The Government of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had made a declaration which constituted an obligation not to cause tension regarding East and West Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he would be glad to give <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> more illustrations of how the East Germans were carrying out their declaration.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he did not know on what date the declaration was made.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said the illustrations he gave were of events that had taken place since this conference began.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had spoken with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> representatives and they denied Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s allegations. He could not say himself. In his opinion the main source was in West Berlin. He had a long dossier which gave dates and named names establishing what was being done in West Berlin but he did not think this was the best route to follow. He had made proposals in regard to access.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> observed that they were not precise.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he would think the matter over and perhaps could formulate them more precisely. He said with respect to paragraph 5 of the Western paper there was no question and that he thought on this point an understanding had been reached. With respect to paragraph 1, he had made many statements about the Soviet position on rights and so had Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The Soviet position was clear and he inquired why this was raised in written form. Would the West consider that an agreement already existed and whether procedures should be worked out. There was another alternative which was to put aside the question of rights so that it would not interfere with the making of concrete arrangements. He stressed that these were preliminary views.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that the reason we attached importance to the reaffirmation of rights was that this question had arisen last November when the Soviets began by saying we had forfeited our rights by violating the Potsdam Agreement. Then, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said we did have rights. We had been in some doubts until <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> now said these rights exist. It was, therefore, natural that we should raise the question.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that we should not ask him to undersign rights of occupation in Berlin fourteen years after the end of the war. The Western logic was that “since you do not like the situation in Berlin, please confirm it”.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_829" n="829" facs="0854"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said with respect to paragraph 3 that we had mentioned Greater Berlin. If there were a source of tension in Berlin from subversive and other activities, it was on both sides. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> himself had mentioned the possibility of reciprocal arrangements in East and West Berlin. He knew that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> considered the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> responsible in East Berlin. If agreement were reached among the Four Powers on access, this meant that there would be some sort of agreement between the Soviets and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. He had mentioned a declaration between the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the Soviet Union. With respect to the subject of propaganda and subversive activities, we considered that the same basis could be used.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he had in mind the declaration which the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had already made. In West Berlin nothing had been done.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that if we made an agreement between the Four Powers all of them would be responsible. The Western Powers could get in touch with the West Berlin Government and the Soviets could get in touch with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> or East Berlin but we would be responsible each to the other.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out that he was being expected to undersign an agreement maintaining the occupation of Berlin, maintaining our troops in Berlin, and a provision for Greater Berlin. This did not constitute a proposition and he could almost assume it had been put forward to make him angry.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said quite solemnly that this was the very maximum to which the Western Powers could go and he was surprised that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not been appreciative of this.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he was sorry the Western Powers were so critical of the Soviet Protocol. He remarked that they considered the idea of a Commission was useful.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he was not sure he understood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Apparently he agreed with our paragraph 1 but was not prepared to say so. With respect to paragraph 2, the difference lay in whether or not Soviet troops were to be added to West Berlin. With respect to paragraph 3, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> objected to the Greater Berlin area but he could not understand that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> objected to doing something about propaganda and subversion. He had said nothing about paragraph 4. He said he agreed with paragraph 5.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said, with respect to troops, the West had talked about symbolic reduction of troops but now talked about symbolic troops. The Soviets talked about symbolic presence.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked what about <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s objections to the Greater Berlin area. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he did object to such an idea but agreed it was good to cease this kind of activity. The Government of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> had taken such an obligation. He would inform us of the date of their declaration.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_830" n="830" facs="0855"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked if he agreed on reciprocity.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that when the Central Government took an obligation it was more important than an undertaking by local officials.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said the important thing was not what they said but what they did.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he considered this activity was carried out by one side.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said it would be interesting to see the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> declaration.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Western Powers had been more precise when they talked about this subject than they were in the document.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> what his opinion was on paragraph 4.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had made several observations on this and the position was clear.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> observed that it was clear but not precise.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> inquired in what aspects.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said we did not see what would be the change a) in the civilian traffic or, b) in military traffic.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the functions which the Soviets fulfilled would be fulfilled by Germans. He pointed out that 90 percent of the traffic was already controlled by Germans.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked if for military traffic the Soviets would substitute German agents for Soviet agents.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied by saying, “Germans”.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked if the Soviets would guarantee the rights and the Germans would carry them out.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that if agreement was reached the Soviets would guarantee.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said we had agreements on military traffic and it was under Soviet responsibility. What we wished to know is would it remain under Soviet responsibility.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the Soviets would give a guarantee.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked if they would make some agreement with the East Germans.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied some kind of agreement with them would be necessary. The Soviets would cease to exercise certain functions. The Germans would take them over.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> remarked that the Soviets would have an agreement with the West and the Soviets would have an agreement with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said if we had an agreement the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would take part in assisting. If we did not want them to sign a document then they could issue a declaration. Then all four of us would take part in guarantees.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_831" n="831" facs="0856"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> asked what would happen if one day the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> decided to stop our traffic.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was an impossible example but pointed out that we would all be parties to the guarantee.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> pointed out that we had no power or responsibility in East Germany. The Soviets were responsible to us for access and the East Germans were responsible to the Soviets.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he could not accept the idea of the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> as agents.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said the four of us would guarantee freedom of access. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would make a declaration and the Soviets would make their agreement with the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that they would make an agreement but it would be a simple one.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> asked if the agreement would establish the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as an occupying power.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied in the negative.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said the Soviets proposed that they would turn over to someone else the responsibility that they had to us without consulting us. He inquired how we could guarantee the behavior of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. If the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> violated the arrangement, and this was a real responsibility [<hi rend="italic">possibility</hi>], whose responsibility would that become?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said if we did not believe in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and in the capacity of the four powers then an agreement would be very difficult.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked what would happen if the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> disagreed with the Soviet Union. As one of the participants would the Soviet Union be responsible.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that they would all look into it together. The Soviet Union had good relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and was sure they would fulfill their agreements because they took this matter seriously.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> asked whom we go to if an American convoy was stopped on the Autobahn.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the first question was to determine in the agreement what should be passed—the number of trains, etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> had raised a hypothetical situation and all of us would have to look into it.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that differences do arise and inquired if we would be expected to go to a government we did not recognize.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be participants whether their signature was on the same paper or not.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said we have had some disagreements on access. Under this agreement to whom would we go?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said we understood each other.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said we understood each other but did not agree.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_832" n="832" facs="0857"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said if he understood correctly there would be an agreement precisely on our access rights and a declaration by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. If there was any difficulty we would go to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said a system of guarantees could be worked out and these could all be in the same agreement or the Four Powers can sign an agreement and there would be a solemn declaration by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and all parties would be responsible.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said present obligations were clear. Our side carried out transport for the needs of a garrison with an obligation not to abuse this, for example, for commercial purposes. The Soviet obligation concerned transportation across the territory of their former zone—number of trains, etc. These arrangements could be confirmed or prolonged by agreement between the four of us. You tell us that your personnel are removed from check points and replace them with Germans. Then the Soviets make an agreement with the German authorities that they accept this responsibility. If difficulties arise we tell the Soviets in a form to be agreed upon and they arrange matters.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> did not raise any new questions in his statement.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> suggested an alternative would be to have Germans at the check point responsible to the Four Powers.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was not possible. As a sovereign state the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would undertake obligations. From the Western point of view it would be wrong to minimize their importance.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would take this responsibility in an agreement with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said their agreement would be very simple. The Soviets would cease to perform certain functions and on a certain date, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would take over the functions which they formerly fulfilled. This function was no longer that of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that it was a Soviet responsibility.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that this was for Four Powers.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> took over functions and responsibility. They were responsible to the Soviets.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he had already explained his position and did not accept that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be their agents.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that they would take over from the Soviets their responsibility and would be responsible to the Soviets.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said it might be useful to seek in black and white what kind of agreement <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had in mind to make with us and what kind of agreement with the East Germans.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said it seemed to him that they had explained their position but we should all think together about the form of guarantees.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_833" n="833" facs="0858"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said it was better to work from a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he wished to raise a new subject—that of the All German Committee. The Soviets had raised this in connection with the Peace Treaty and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> had mentioned it yesterday. The Western Powers knew the, Soviet position on the All German Committee, namely that it should be established by Germans. However, he said that we here could recommend to them to create such a Committee on the basis of parity—not 25—10. He pointed out that there are two sides. They may discuss the question of reunification of Germany by stages. They might discuss the question of the principles of a Peace Treaty as well. It would be advisable to establish a certain period of time for the Committee to complete its work such as within one year.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> asked if the Committee disagreed, would they then submit their two proposals to elections.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said no, that this was outside of his proposal.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> asked if the principles of a Peace Treaty were to apply after reunification.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that it be left to the Germans to decide this. Let them try for one year to undertake these tasks. The terms of reference would be (1) to discuss reunification by stages and (2) the principles of a Peace Treaty.</p>
<p>After an interval in which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> raised the question of Polish and Czech participation but quickly dropped it saying he regretted the Western attitude on this matter and made clear he wished to keep the matter open, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> that the matter that they had been discussing today was, of course, within the framework of their Berlin proposals.</p>
<p>It was agreed to hold another private meeting on Thursday and a plenary session on Friday.</p>

Paris for Embassy, <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CINCEUR1">CINCEUR</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> &amp; West. At today’s informal monthly meeting with Commandants, Major <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> gave his views on Geneva Conference. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said his concern and that of Senate center on three points (and he made clear he most greatly concerned re third point):</p>
<p>(1) <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> noted <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had utilized plenary session to make detailed accusations against West Berlin propaganda and intelligence activities. He hoped West powers would utilize plenary session to set forth factual and detailed account of Communist intelligence and propaganda activities centered in East Berlin. He felt West should point out these activities directed against not only West Berlin and <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> but other countries as well, such as Scandinavia. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> urged use of plenary session in order that exposé could be publicized world press.</p>
<p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> expressed concern lest in any understanding with Russians, West Powers neglect civilian access compared with garrison access. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said he is having prepared on urgent basis a study of civilian access which would contain number new ideas and suggestions. Study will be forwarded to <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> delegation Geneva. He mentioned also that Senator <persName corresp="#p_KG1">Guenter Klein</persName> would be returning to Geneva tomorrow.</p>
<p>(3) <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said it vital that DM West continue to be currency of West Berlin: “Should anything come between West German mark and the mark circulating in West Berlin” industrial and commercial life of Berlin would be jeopardized and he would “not wish to assume responsibility for consequences.”</p>
<p>Speaking of current economic conditions, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said present economic level West Berlin better than Senate had dared hope two months ago. He made specific reference to employment, production and orders. More tourists visiting Berlin now than at same time last year.</p>
<p>Of West Berlin morale, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said he could speak with less certainty than of economic conditions. His impression was that morale had not basically changed from that of one month ago, but that two new factors had had effect: (1) relaxation following stirring events of May day and airlift memorial ceremonies, which all the more apparent now that May 27 safely passed; 2) apprehension engendered by world press speculation on possible Western “concessions” at Geneva.</p>

<p>10647. Deliver following message to Prime Minister from the President. Advise date time delivery.</p>
<p>“June 3, 1959</p>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName>:</p>
<p>I am glad that you have given <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> such firm support. Before your cable<note n="1" xml:id="d360fn1"><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s message, June 2, was repeated to London at the end of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s message in this telegram. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> stated that he hoped there would be sufficient progress at Geneva to hold a summit meeting. In particular he thought that not very much progress was required, perhaps only an agreed formulation of the two positions would be enough. On June 3, however, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_WJH1">Whitney</persName> that he doubted whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> really was anxious for a summit meeting. The Prime Minister thought that the Soviet Union would break off the Geneva talks and sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany, an eventuality that he believed the West was completely unprepared for. (Telegram 6338 from London, June 3; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Central Files, 396.1/6–359)</note> arrived I had sent to <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> a message<note n="2" xml:id="d360fn2">See <ref target="#d357">Document 357</ref>.</note> telling him that I thought <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> had developed well in his post and that in my opinion he was doing a fine job. I think your statement should neutralize any damage done to his prestige by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> article of June first.</p>
<p>This morning I shall be in a press conference<note n="3" xml:id="d360fn3">See <ref target="#d351fn6">footnote 6, Document 351</ref>.</note> and I shall undoubtedly be questioned closely about any discernible progress at Geneva and therefore the possibility of a Summit Conference.</p>
<p>As you know, I adhere to my position that a Summit meeting based on nothing more than wishful thinking would be a disaster. The world would interpret such a move as being a virtual surrender, while Soviet prestige would be enhanced.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we agreed in our conversations at Camp David<note n="4" xml:id="d360fn4">See Documents <ref target="#d234">234</ref>–<ref target="#d241">241</ref>.</note> that we could afford to make a rather liberal definition of progress. While I agree that a document formulating our two positions would be a useful document, I do think we must also have something recognizable as a specific accomplishment. For example there might be included as a prerequisite in your formula something of this sort: “Since the Geneva Conference is partially a result of the crisis of Berlin, created by the <pb xml:id="pg_836" n="836" facs="0861"/>Soviet Union, there must be an agreement confirming the continuing status of Berlin pending the reunification of Germany.” I do not see how any of us can with self-respect go to a Summit meeting unless such a statement has been issued by the Soviets or an agreement to this effect has been consummated.</p>
<p>While I shall not try to give at my press conference a full list of the things that would spell additional real progress at the Foreign Ministers’ meetings, we might hope for a widening of contacts between the two sides of the Iron Curtain, particularly in the fields of press exchanges, books and travel by private citizens. Other ways in which progress might be achieved would be by some firm agreement for initial steps in banning of particular tests and control thereof.</p>
<p>I repeat that the production by the Foreign Ministers of a reasonable paper for us to work on at a Summit Conference, together with the assurance that there will be no further attempts to restrict our rights and privileges with respect to Berlin, constitute the very minimum that would justify a Summit meeting.</p>
<p>These are not new ideas; so far as I know, all of us are agreed on them.</p>
<p>With warm regard,</p>
<p>As ever, Ike”</p>

<p>1. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> concerned over State pronouncement that further high altitude flights not now planned in Berlin air corridors.</p>
<p>2. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recognizes importance political implications attendant on further high flights during Geneva discussions. Nevertheless <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> firmly believe flights should be reinstituted at earliest possible time on regular and frequent basis without restriction to visual flight conditions. By halting flight, Soviets in position to exploit and proclaim correctness of statements that flights were instituted as provocative gestures without real operational requirement. US placed in position of explaining reasons for terminating flights, since we stated high flights operationally necessary.</p>
<p>3. C–130 is primary theater logistic support aircraft in Europe. It designed have most efficient operation of high altitudes. Present situation precludes efficient and economical use available transport resources. Theater commander denied latitude of selection of best means available to accomplish his support mission for Berlin.</p>

<p>Department recognizes force argumentation of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. Nevertheless, while present negotiations proceeding or future negotiations in prospect or proceeding, i.e.—high altitude flights would undoubtedly become subject of Soviet propaganda exploitation, using theme that US had unilaterally changed status quo, after having warned Soviets that Soviet action changing status quo would damage possibility fruitful negotiations, conceivable, however, that at some stage high altitude flights could have useful impact as demonstrating US firmness of purpose. This question of judgement to be appraised in light of developing circumstances.</p>
<p>If decision taken to make flights, British and French will expect to be advised in advance.</p>

At one point <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested possibility of forum to hear complaints. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> insisted upon talking only about arrangements in West Berlin alone to end activities he alleged being carried on there.</p>
<p>Greater part of meeting devoted to statements along familiar lines by each side regarding their positions. Secretary again emphasized importance reaffirming Western rights in view fact Soviets once said we had lost them and now spoke of turning over protection these rights to someone else without our knowing whether this someone would protect our rights. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> insisted main question was status West Berlin and ending occupation there.</p>
<p>Secretary said Allied troops important reassurance to West Berliners, were symbolic and Soviets could take West Berlin tomorrow if they wanted unless it started world war. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> expressed doubts neutral troops would remain indefinitely and Berliners would not have same confidence in them as in Allied troops.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_839" n="839" facs="0864"/>
<p>After meeting <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked Secretary what he meant by remark to effect Soviets could capture West Berlin but this would mean world war. Secretary replied he only stated the obvious but such Soviet move would have consequences he had suggested. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said not good to make threats and these did not frighten Soviets. He could make strong statements too but thought this would not contribute to reaching agreement.</p>

<p>The conversation during dinner was nonsubstantive. The atmosphere was unstrained and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made a more than usual effort to be agreeable and witty.</p>
<p>After coffee the entire party settled down together and the Ministers launched into a discussion picking up where the conversation had ended in the afternoon.</p>
<p>In response to some remark of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s which I missed, I heard Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> say that the Soviet Union would naturally defend the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and its sovereignty as a member of the Warsaw Pact.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_840" n="840" facs="0865"/>
<p>The Secretary then said as he understood it the Soviets proposed to turn over their rights to the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the Soviets contemplated ceasing to exercise their functions which after the turnover would be exercised by the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>The Secretary remarked, in apparent summary of their private conversation up to that point, that the Ministers seemed to be moving rapidly towards nothing.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> answered that the Soviets came to Geneva to negotiate seriously but if the Western Ministers put up proposals such as the ones submitted yesterday, then the Soviets gravely doubt that there is any desire on the Western part to negotiate seriously.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> said that there was nothing new in our position. As the Soviets know we will not give up our rights or the retention of our troops in Berlin but we are making an effort to meet the expressed worries of the Soviets.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that our proposals were no good for that purpose.</p>
<p>The Secretary interjected that it was the Soviets who had created the present tension and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> countered by saying that it was Western troops in Berlin which created it. He added that we had also contributed to the present situation by what we had done in the Federal Republic of Germany and our earlier violation of the Potsdam Agreement.</p>
<p>The Secretary inquired who first broke the Potsdam Agreement and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that it would be a waste of time to argue points of past history. He said that the Soviets admit that the West have rights but that fourteen years have passed and there are now two states in Germany, which creates a changed situation.</p>
<p>The Secretary inquired directly if legal rights expire with time and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied, “Yes.”</p>
<p>The Secretary said that time had passed and wondered with the passage of time if Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, for example, should not now be free.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reacted violently and asked why the Secretary was introducing matters which had no connection with Berlin for purely polemical reasons. He said that he also could mention other things.</p>
<p>The Secretary returned to the question of why the passage of time affected our rights in Germany and asked wherein the danger lay which the Soviets professed to see.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reiterated that fourteen years had passed and the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> now existed as a state. West Berlin was in the center of <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> territory but apparently it is our desire to discuss internal matters unrelated to Berlin.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that we recognize as a fact that there is a so-called <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> and that West Berlin exists. We recognize reality and are prepared to <pb xml:id="pg_841" n="841" facs="0866"/>adjust to it reasonably, to which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> answered that he saw no evidence of any Western intent to adjust.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> repeated that the West would not change the status of Berlin nor withdraw its troops and that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should now realize this.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> inquired what proposals we had to make since those of yesterday obviously could not bring us closer to an agreement.</p>
<p>The Secretary remarked that he really didn’t know where we went from here.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> exclaimed, “You want us to undersign your occupation regime!” to which the Secretary answered that all we wanted was the Soviets to admit our rights.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> interjected that in three respects we had proffered concessions. He said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> by now should realize that we would not accept his free city proposal and apparently he would not accept our proposal for uniting Berlin. Within the limits of this basic disagreement we had offered to consider improvements in the propaganda situation and to place a ceiling over our troops and to consider any Soviet proposals on access. He added that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made no concession whatsoever. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> continued that in any arrangement which might be agreed would be the explicit understanding that it would last until Germany was reunified.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> added that in addition to those mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> we had made a fourth concession, namely, our willingness to consider an interim arrangement for West Berlin outside the Western Peace Plan.<note n="1" xml:id="d363fn1">See <ref target="#d295fn1">footnote 1, Document 295</ref>.</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he saw no sign of any concession in what we had said. On troops we were merely abandoning what we do not now have and we were asking him to countersign our occupation regime. He then asked as a question, what would we say to an agreement which said nothing on our rights.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> replied that if the Soviets agreed not to question any such arrangements for six months or some other brief period, that was one thing. On the other hand if they agreed that any such arrangements were valid until Germany was reunified, that was another.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked why we could not discuss arrangements now and further asked what was wrong with avoiding any invocation of our rights but merely agree on arrangements.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said that our difficulty is perfectly clear and of Soviet creation. He said the Soviets have disputed our rights and in fact in the note of November 27<note n="2" xml:id="d363fn2">See <ref target="#d72">Document 72</ref>.</note> had declared them null and void. This statement had <pb xml:id="pg_842" n="842" facs="0867"/>not been repeated by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at Geneva who had contented himself with saying that the Soviets do not like the present situation without disputing our legal position. Nevertheless the Soviets had originally raised the question of our rights in their notes and we are left wondering what would happen in the future.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said we have so far reached no agreement on arrangements and suggested that that is what should be done.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that it was the Soviets who had sowed the seeds of doubts which now grew in our minds. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> rejoined the doubts are not justified.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> added that we had thought the 1949 agreement<note n="3" xml:id="d363fn3">For text of the final communiqué of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, June 20, 1949, see <ref target="frus1949v03"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1949, vol. III</ref>, pp. 1062–1065.</note> was good but now the Soviets challenged it.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he realized we were worried about our rights, “but let us eliminate them from the picture.”</p>
<p>The Secretary noted that if we say nothing of our rights, would not the Soviets assume that we have given them up? He said that they had been challenged by the Soviets and their notes had denied their continued existence. He asked if the Soviets would publicly acknowledge our rights in a form, for example, such as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had done in his Leipzig speech.<note n="4" xml:id="d363fn4">For text of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech at Leipzig on March 7, 1959, see <hi rend="italic">Pravda,</hi> March 27, 1959; an extract from the speech is printed in <hi rend="italic">Moskau Bonn,</hi> pp. 518–524.</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he suggested this question of rights be set to one side and agreement reached on arrangements.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> reminded <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the Soviet Government had spoken of concluding a separate peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> thereby extinguishing our rights. This posed an obvious problem for us.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> answered that the peace treaty was another matter and that if we reach agreement on arrangements for West Berlin then each state involved in the agreement will continue to fulfill its obligations.</p>
<p>The Secretary then said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said that no arrangements were possible until the occupation status of West Berlin had been given up.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked what our ideas were on West Berlin. He said they had had nothing from the Secretary on this point.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that he was repeating himself but that he had noted three concessions we had offered and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had added a fourth.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> ridiculed the proposal on troop ceilings.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> reminded Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that on the question of access procedures we had indicated the possibility of the Soviets using Germans, to which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied, “After all it’s their country.”</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_843" n="843" facs="0868"/>
<p>The Secretary said after all the Soviets have obligations to us. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s reply was, “Our past obligations.”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> then suggested putting matters another way. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had asked us what our concessions or proposals were and he now asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> what were his. The Secretary noted in an aside that every Soviet proposal so far involved taking away our rights.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> again asked what we proposed to him. He said that on the third point (illegal and clandestine operations) he saw a certain forward step and he was thinking along approximately the same lines but that this could not be separated from the other elements.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that he had thought there had been some progress in the talk yesterday about access arrangements.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he had discussed that fully yesterday and had nothing to add. He saw our cause for concern and realized that this was an important matter for us. He thought that it was possible to find a satisfactory understanding on this point but that it could not be agreed apart from the other related points.</p>
<p>In reply to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s question as to what elements there were to be considered apart from propaganda, access and troops and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s companion question as to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s view on the troops, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> answered that he had expressed himself many times. He understood that we wanted a guarantee on access but to require the Soviets to accept an agreement not to increase Western troops in Berlin was too much. He then asked how could we expect an agreement to be reached which involved maintaining the present situation in West Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked why the Soviets were worried over our symbolic troops in Berlin. Was it a question of prestige?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not reply directly but said that there was a physical relationship to the troops and the situation in the city and that whereas they might be only 11,000 or possibly 15,000, this number was worse than 50,000 Western troops in some other location in Europe.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> asked how many Soviet troops were in East Berlin and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he thought none. When <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> then asked how many Soviet troops were within a few miles of Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he did not know.</p>
<p>There was then some half serious talk about the rotating symbolic Four Power guard of Spandau Prison in West Berlin which was a Soviet military presence which <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said we did not dispute.</p>
<p>The Secretary then said to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, “I would like to ask you if we were to sign a satisfactory agreement with no mention of our rights would you consider that we had given up all our rights?”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> turned aside the question by asking why it was being raised and referring to the fact that he had suggested that in any <pb xml:id="pg_844" n="844" facs="0869"/>agreement there be neither any positive nor negative indication with respect to our rights.</p>
<p>The Secretary said this would leave us in a position where we did not know where we stood. We might say we had maintained our rights and the Soviets would claim we had abandoned them. He then asked if our old agreements would still stand, to which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that they would not be involved.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> then said in other words our old agreements would stand if they had not been renounced.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> as a hypothetical question what public reply the Soviet Government would make if, having reached an agreement on West Berlin making no mention of our rights, the three Western Governments were to declare concurrently with the agreement or immediately afterwards that the Soviets had acknowledged that we were legally in Berlin and had not disputed our rights of presence there and access.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked why anyone should say anything about rights since they would not be involved in the agreement and that it would be contrary to our agreement to mention them.</p>
<p>Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pushed him on this point, pointing out that it would be impossible not to answer publicly questions concerning the status of our rights and noting that we had <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s public statement that we were legally in West Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> kept insisting that the agreement would require that there be no mention of rights.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that it would be impossible for him to go home and face the Congress without being able to say exactly where our rights stood and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> noted that the challenge to our rights was the whole cause of the controversy and the reason for our presence in Geneva.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was reminded that the Soviet note of November 27 had declared our rights null and void, to which he replied that we had given too narrow an interpretation to the language of the Soviet notes.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that the main question to be settled was the question of our rights and their acknowledgment.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> countered by saying that the main question was the presence of Western troops in West Berlin. For the fiftieth time he inquired what constructive proposals we had to offer, upon which unanswered question the meeting broke up at 11:20 p.m.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic">Possible Visit by Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> to Geneva</hi></p>
<p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that Senator <persName corresp="#p_KG1">Klein</persName> of Berlin has returned to Geneva and told <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> this morning that Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> was unhappy about the extent to which the German Foreign Office was keeping him informed about the Conference.<note n="1" xml:id="d364fn1">A memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName>’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KG1">Klein</persName> at 8:30 a.m., US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/78, is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1339.</note> <persName corresp="#p_KG1">Klein</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> would be happy to come to Geneva on Monday on his way to Paris for an engagement on Tuesday. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> thought it would be excellent if the Secretary were to invite <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> to a lunch to be attended also by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName>. The Secretary said he thought this was a very good idea. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> suggested, however, that, since <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> might be expected to make some public statements on the Conference in Paris, it might be preferable to ask <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> to come to Geneva after his visit to Paris. The Secretary indicated agreement.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s Views on Limitation of Forces in Berlin</hi></p>
<p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> called attention to a telegram from Paris<note n="2" xml:id="d364fn2">Telegram 4469 from Paris, June 4. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 762.00/6—459)</note> reporting General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s concern over a possible agreement involving the reduction of allied forces in Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> observed that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> was concerned about quantitative limitations on allied forces in Berlin and said it was not clear whether <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> was referring to a ceiling on troop strength at present levels or to a reduction of forces.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic">Tactical Matters</hi></p>
<p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that as of last night neither <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had a prepared statement for today’s plenary. There was some <pb xml:id="pg_846" n="846" facs="0871"/>discussion of the US draft of a common declaration on Berlin,<note n="3" xml:id="d364fn3">For text of this draft, transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 78 from Geneva, June 6, see <ref target="#d372">Document 372</ref>, and footnotes <ref target="#d372fn3">3</ref> and <ref target="#d372fn4">4</ref> thereto.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> indicating that he thought it not desirable to discuss it at the Coordinating Group meeting today<note n="4" xml:id="d364fn4">A memorandum of the conversation at the Coordinating Group meeting at 10:30 a.m. during which the Deputies reviewed many of the points discussed here by the U.S. Delegation, US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/81, is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1367.</note> since it was essentially a fall-back paper. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> agreed, noting that the paper needed reworking. The Secretary observed that the reference in paragraph 1 of the declaration to reunification should be lifted out and made a separate paragraph. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said it might be desirable to use the paper at the private session on Saturday, and the Secretary added that <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> hoped we could use it at that time.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Illegal Communist Activities in West Berlin</hi></p>
<p>4. There was extensive discussion of the desirability of the Secretary making a statement at the plenary today on illegal communist activities in East Berlin. The Secretary thought that, if we could not add a great deal to what Berlin Interior Senator Lipschitz had said to the press yesterday about the Senat <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> Paper it might not be desirable for him to make such a statement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> expressed the view that it would be useful to put on the record our data on these activities, noting that to date only one side of the picture had been presented. Both Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> indicated that they thought this material had been fairly well got into public channels. The Secretary then suggested that we might see how his draft speech dovetailed with the material made public by the West Berlin Government, particularly making sure that we do not appear to be echoing the Germans. The Secretary remarked that a decision had been reached two days ago for him to speak at the plenary on the subject but that this was before Senator Lipschitz’s press conference.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Press Leaks</hi></p>
<p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said that Hightower of the <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> had told him that he had had from “British and French sources” information about yestersay’s private session. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> also called attention to the <gloss target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss> account in the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Geneve</hi> of yesterday’s private meeting. He emphasized that the US had scrupulously abided by the agreement on no publicity about the private meetings and said that British and French action made it much harder for us. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that we could not forget that we have a bludgeon to use on the British and French. We can say that the leaks have become so regular and accurate, and that we are so satisfied that the US is not to blame, that the only way for us to <pb xml:id="pg_847" n="847" facs="0872"/>proceed would be for the Secretary to deal with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> alone. He admitted that this was a heavy stick, but he thought we should not forget that we have it in our closet. The Secretary observed that it was interesting that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not directly asked to see him alone. Mr. Bundy noted that there have been certain indirect approaches in this respect.</p>
<p>[Here follow paragraphs 6 and 7 on unrelated subjects.]</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Role in Berlin Settlement</hi></p>
<p>8. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> said he thought that if we reached the stage where we begin drafting a communiqué on the Foreign Ministers’ Conference, it would be desirable to bear in mind making some reference to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He thought it important to do so: 1) because of charges that the Administration pays only lip service to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; and 2) in view of the danger of the Berlin situation, prospects for lessening friction might be increased if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> were to assume some kind of minor role in the area. The Secretary commented that the discussions to date have not lent themselves to consideration of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role. He thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> had a valid point and that if we had some agreement to be carried out, then we might draw on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> agreed that it would be desirable to get across the point that the US would not object to some kind of international presence in Berlin. The Secretary pointed out, however, that the terms of reference were very important and indicated that mere generalization would not be desirable. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> itself, he said, would not accept the role unless it knew exactly what was involved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> suggested that if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> were to pick up the declaratory passage in Stage I of the Western Peace Plan, then we might in the communiqué recite language of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and induce the Soviets to reaffirm their Charter obligations.</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>Informal discussions during the last 36 hours have centered entirely on talking points which we had put on paper representing our <pb xml:id="pg_848" n="848" facs="0873"/>views as to what should be included in a Berlin settlement.

He has made a point of not mentioning our rights in any form and we are insisting this is the key to our position since the Soviets began the effort, to deny these rights. He is likewise most anxious to have occupation forces reduced considerably and we are unwilling to go beyond a ceiling limitation within existing numbers.</p>
<p>I can sense rather than report some progress. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is obviously nervous and seems to be moving slightly in our direction. Your press conference<note n="2" xml:id="d365fn2">See <ref target="#d351fn6">footnote 6, Document 351</ref>.</note> was a great help to us and all Allied Ministers agree that it struck exactly the right note.

Chancellor is now in meeting with Cabinet and will lead special faction meeting at one o’clock.

<p>There is unprecedented confusion and discouragement throughout <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss>/DU faction where <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s tactics are considered embarrassing and clumsy. Even among those at lower levels completely devoted <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> policies most frequent remark is that “this is case for psychiatrist.” <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> leaders especially, but also others, express concern that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> will have lost respect and authority in party, that stability and orderliness Federal Republic politics and <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> will be questioned everywhere abroad. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is reported to have said to von Hassel who warned against these consequences that there would indeed be uproar but it would die down in few days. At least one <gloss target="#t_CSU1">CSU</gloss> deputy, Kemmer, added that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s popularity remains unweakened and public would continue willing accept his decision as wise and necessary in any case.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> letter to faction proposed <persName corresp="#p_EF1">Etzel</persName> as presidential candidate and much of irritation in <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> is being directed at him for willingness be party to such disruptive measures.

<p>1053. Geneva for <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName>. On return [from?] Geneva yesterday I requested appointment Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>. He received me at his house late last night in usual friendly manner but stated he particularly glad <pb xml:id="pg_852" n="852" facs="0877"/>have chance talk at length because he had never been more depressed in his life and wished unburden himself. Principal causes his low state mind:</p>
<p>1. He is extremely upset over apparent decision not hold presidential elections in Berlin on July 1 particularly after it has been so frequently stated publicly that they will be held here. Furthermore five years ago previous presidential elections held here and precedent created. If it abandoned now, can only appear to Russians and Berlin population that West is beating retreat from Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> is convinced that such retreat will not favorably impress Russians but merely egg them on as favorable gestures to Russians are not appreciated by them but merely excite their derision. He added that <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> had learned through its Ostburo that after his colleague Ollenauer visited <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Embassy East Berlin<note n="1" xml:id="d368fn1">This meeting took place on March 9.</note> he and Socialist Party had been subject of derisive witticisms by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, who had made fun of them as easy to fool. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> also depressed by circumstance that he unable ascertain who is responsible for decision not to hold presidential election here. In so far as he can learn everyone concerned disclaims responsibility and puts it on to someone else. Germans generally blame Allies and he had heard that Allies disclaim any responsibility.</p>
<p>His depression re this matter further increased by efforts being made by some circles even to prevent President <persName corresp="#p_HT1">Heuss</persName> from coming Berlin formally to take possession Schloss Bellevue which has been restored as official presidential residence here. He feels that if <persName corresp="#p_HT1">Heuss</persName> is forced to call off an already announced visit and rescind invitations already given out for dinner and reception on June 18 Berlin will really have been abandoned in eyes of world.</p>
<p>2. He had learned through German channels that Western Foreign Ministers had presented memorandum to Russians on June 3<note n="2" xml:id="d368fn2">See <ref target="#d358fn3">footnote 3, Document 358</ref>.</note> which reportedly made major concessions with regard to Berlin and Allied rights to protect city. He had ascertained that German Delegation in Geneva had this memorandum and had requested to be informed concerning its contents. His request had met with flat refusal accompanied by explanation that paper was not one intended to be seen by Berlin’s Mayor. He remarked with wry, bitter note that as chief magistrate of object to be altered he thought he had right to know what proposed to be done to him and his people—after all the Russians know.</p>
<p>I had already received Geneva’s 45 to Berlin<note n="3" xml:id="d368fn3">Telegram 45 transmitted the paper referred to in <ref target="#d358fn3">footnote 2</ref> above. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/6–359)</note> and was able assure him that Berlin had not been sold out. I did not tell him that I had seen <pb xml:id="pg_853" n="853" facs="0878"/>text but merely that I had learned in Geneva that Russians had been complaining in various ways that Western powers are maintaining troops in Berlin as threat to peace of Europe and are engaging in propaganda and various other activities further to aggravate threat. I added that Western powers had, I understood, decided make it very clear to Russians that they had no intention yielding any their rights whatsoever but that they were willing listen to any specific suggestions Russians might wish make as to what the Western powers might do, without infringing their rights, to meet specific Soviet grievances. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> seemed reassured.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> grateful for information furnished him recently by U.S. Mission and asked me to send his personal thanks to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>. He still feels very strong sense of grievance over incomplete information he is receiving through German channels and is therefore especially thankful for reassurance he has received through us that confusing and disheartening press reports have no factual basis.</p>
<p>I told <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> I had been glad be able report in Geneva that Berliners were keeping up their spirits. He added that this was true, that morale was still good, but that he was receiving increasing reports to effect that people throughout city who had not hitherto shown interest in such things were giving more and more attention to discouraging press political reports. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> made it very plain that Berlin morale will be subject most severe strain when Berliners become aware that presidential election will not be held here and that some public gesture on the part of the West will be necessary to counteract bad effect of such announcement.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> took up following additional points:</p>
<p>A. He would be leaving Berlin next morning to visit Copenhagen. After returning for weekend would leave Tuesday for a 2–1/2 day visit Paris. Some his colleagues have suggested that Western Foreign Ministers might be critical over his leaving city now. He asked me to report that he can be reached at any minute through German diplomatic missions in Copenhagen or Paris and that he felt it would be harmful for him put off his visits.</p>
<p>B. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> remarked parenthetically after his adversion to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s reaction to Ollenauer visit that controversy which had arisen in <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> about <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> journalists’ visits to Soviet Union was apparently resolving itself satisfactorily. I believe he inserted this remark to register opinion that controversy embarrassing to negotiations in Geneva was not likely to break out in the Social Democratic Party and that the proWestern elements in party were gaining strength.</p>
<p>C. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> described as unfortunate <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s announcement that he wished continue as Chancellor and would not be candidate for <pb xml:id="pg_854" n="854" facs="0879"/>presidency.<note n="4" xml:id="d368fn4"><persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s decision was announced on June 4.</note> It will greatly confuse political situation and not be conducive to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s own prestige while at same time continuation in Chancellor’s office will subject him to physical and mental strain which might terminate his activity under circumstances that could further complicate situation. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> had not had time think over full implications of announcement but his initial reactions remarkably nonpartisan.</p>
<p>Re <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>’s complaint under heading (2) above, with telegrams [I am?] now receiving I can reassure him regarding what is not being done in Geneva. His discontent with his own people over their failure better to inform him and bad effect of their tactless remarks, such as that matters concerning Berlin are not matters about which he can always properly query them, present problem that unfavorably affect Allied interests but cannot be remedied without German corrective action.</p>
<p>Re <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>’s concern about presidential election, I recommend that we tell Germans go ahead and hold election here. If election is not held here we will be blamed. Resulting bad effect on Berlin morale will very likely be such that some extremely strong gesture from Western side will be required to repair damage—and such gesture might involve much more objectionable implications than holding election here.</p>

Following is summary uncleared memorandum of private meeting at <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s Villa 11 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. devoted to Berlin.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_855" n="855" facs="0880"/>
<p>Discussion revolved around rights, troop numbers and separate treaty. We stressed need to know where we stood on rights. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> repeatedly stated Soviets wanted no mention of rights in agreement. Under repeated pressing he still would not explain <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> position on what effect a new agreement would have on our rights.</p>
<p>Regarding access, he took position this could be easily settled if status of West Berlin agreed upon. He pictured our talking paper<note n="1" xml:id="d369fn1">See <ref target="#d358fn3">footnote 3, Document 358</ref>.</note> as backward step, and as take or leave it approach and tried to elicit more details our position. In discussion of troop levels <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> denied they were interested in naming figure but said our proposal for ceiling was backward step. He then indicated that level of troops would be political not technical decision.</p>
<p>Pressed by Secretary and others for reaffirmation of Soviet recognition of Western rights in Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that whatever agreement is reached will be observed fully until German reunification is achieved, that question of Western rights should not be involved and that, in fact, failure to raise this issue would be in interest of West. He would not say that this would preclude signature of a separate peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Soviets were not, he said, suggesting either affirmation or denial of Western rights. An agreement reached among the four re Berlin would be observed regardless of any other agreements. Continued Western insistence on question of rights elicited only the response that Soviet Union does not deny the existence of such rights—but <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued to insist that any agreement on Berlin should contain no reference to them.</p>

<p>2. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR has declared the intention of the Soviet Government to withdraw its forces from Berlin. The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of France, the United Kingdom and the United States declare that it is the intention of their governments not to increase the combined total of the forces they now maintain in Berlin. They further declare that they may be able to reduce such forces, but only to the extent, consistent with their responsibilities, that developments in Berlin permit.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 91. For the President from the Secretary.</p>
<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>Today marks the opening of the fifth week of our conference and I have reached the conclusion that we are at a crossroads which requires a new initiative on our part. The situation today, as I see it, is that we have presented the Western peace plan and persuasively supported it in semi-public plenary sessions. We have also in same forum disposed of Soviet package. For past two weeks real dialogue has been in private meetings with severely restricted attendance.</p>
<p>These sessions have concentrated on possible nature of arrangements for West Berlin pending reunification, the latter an event probably years distant.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_859" n="859" facs="0884"/>
<p>During last week of private meetings it has been accepted, I believe, by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that we will not consider his free city proposal. He has equally made it clear that Soviets will not consider our united Berlin proposal. Much underbrush has been cleared away. Significantly <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has acknowledged that our present presence in Berlin is by right. He consistently refuses, however, to contemplate any reference to our rights in any agreement which might be reached here. He has not insisted on the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> being a party to such agreement and he has accepted our reiterated refusal to accord <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> recognition. He affirms that any agreement reached here will be scrupulously adhered to by the Soviets until reunification and also by <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> who would accept obligation in bilateral collateral arrangement between Soviets and <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> or some comparable method which I think could be worked out satisfactorily to us.</p>
<p>Essence of the position as I see it today is that an agreement reached here on Berlin with Soviets which lacked any reference to our rights (and to variety of agreements and arrangements based on them during past fourteen years) would make it difficult in future to contest claim by Soviets on such future day as they choose to conclude separate peace treaty with <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> that all rights, obligations and arrangements not specifically covered in any agreement reached and recorded here at Geneva would from that day forward be extinguished. It is conceivable that some other way could be found to protect us on this point, such as a declaration by us which the Soviets would accept without denial, but I am dubious, particularly in view of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s recent statement in Budapest<note n="1" xml:id="d373fn1">At a press conference in Budapest on June 7, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated that the Soviet Union could not accept an agreement on Berlin that perpetuated the occupation regime. Extracts from the press conference were printed in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> June 8.</note> which. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reflected in sterile private session.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I believe a new attempt to break the deadlock is required. To be effective with the Soviets it must come from the United States. Otherwise we will not only waste time from now on but more important risk misinterpretation by the Soviets of the solidity of our basic position. Accordingly I would appreciate your guidance on the following course of action which I recommend. If approved by you I would then seek the agreement of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> to my talking without delay to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> alone along the lines I am about to suggest.</p>
<p>I would then plan to tell <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>:</p>
<p>(1) That the conference is clearly now getting nowhere though each side has usefully obtained a clearer picture of the other’s position.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_860" n="860" facs="0885"/>
<p>(2) That the Allied position on the following points is immovable and not open to negotiation:</p>
<p>(A) That any agreement reached here must reflect the fact that it is without prejudice to the continuation in force of our rights of presence in and access to Berlin.</p>
<p>(B) That we might ourselves consider in the future some modest reduction in the strength of our garrisons, depending on circumstances, but that we will not admit a Soviet detachment to join them in West Berlin nor reduce them to what he apparently considers “symbolic.” In this connection I would emphasize that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has agreed our garrisons have no military significance.</p>
<p>(C) That we have no intention of recognizing the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>. He accepts though he disagrees. Hence provision for the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> to respect any agreement reached with Soviets is matter to be worked out between them and <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> in a form acceptable to us.</p>
<p>(D) That no agreement is in order on propaganda and similar activities since Soviets state they attach little importance to this. Each side, however, might undertake to exercise restraint in common interest of avoiding aggravation tensions.</p>
<p>(E) That clarification of access procedures would of course protect all civilian traffic as well as garrisons’ needs and in effort to meet Soviets’ expressed desires we could accept turnover by Soviet to <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> of ‘functions’ relating to military traffic on basis implying no Western recognition <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> and providing it accepted that in case of any future complaints on our part our recourse would continue to be to the USSR.</p>
<p>(3) I would plan to conclude by telling <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that if agreement can be reached at this conference which takes into account the foregoing desiderata, then I believe you would be prepared to agree to a summit conference this summer or fall. I would ask him to consider my statement in all seriousness and add that I would be prepared to accept a brief recess if he desired to consult Moscow in light of what I had just told him. Finally I would suggest that the prolongation of a sterile conference would seem to add little to the relaxation of tensions which we seek and which purpose we assume Soviets share.</p>
<p>A word on the atmosphere. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> remains relatively moderate in debate both public and private. He and his entourage are making considerable effort to give impression of friendly and serious effort to reach agreement, but are completely inflexible.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> is an excellent partner, articulate and forceful. Relations with the French Delegation which is large and well staffed with Soviet experts are excellent. The West Germans are on the whole quiet but solid. They stay in the background and in the last few days have been obviously disturbed by <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s reversal of his decision on the presidency.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> has played the Allied game faithfully. He remains highly sensitive but I think our relations with him and his delegation are very good. Certainly they are far better than during the opening days of the <pb xml:id="pg_861" n="861" facs="0886"/>conference. In debate he is often too ready to inject a moderating remark and to profess to see points of agreement with the Soviet when in fact none exists. I now expect no real difficulty with sudden British initiatives. Indeed <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> has consistently hung back rather than tried to assume any role of leadership. I suspect British ‘flexibility’ will be held in reserve for a summit conference. This is not to say, however, that they do not very badly want a summit conference and if signs were to multiply that we will break up here without agreement our lines might not hold.</p>
<p>In sum, as I have written, I think the time has come for me to take a direct initiative with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in the effort to reach an acceptable agreement. I am satisfied that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will accept seriously what I say to him alone, whereas the same statement made in one of our private quadripartite meetings is likely to be interpreted by him as a negotiating position. There is a risk, of course, that this conference will end with no accomplishment and in this connection we are working very secretly on a contingency basis for a public presentation and posture to cover our disengagement. This risk, however, has been inherent since our acceptance of the conference and I believe the time has come to push the issue. I would appreciate your instructions. In light of <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">Neil McElroy</persName>’s participation in the Conference you may want to make a copy of this message available to him. Faithfully, Signed: Chris”</p>

<p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>Last evening <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> dined with me at my Villa. Following dinner and bridge we talked with <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> only other person present about state we now found ourselves in at conference. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> is firmly convinced we are at dead end now confirmed at highest level by <pb xml:id="pg_862" n="862" facs="0887"/><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s Budapest statement.<note n="1" xml:id="d374fn1">See <ref target="#d373fn1">footnote 1, Document 373</ref>.</note> To him disengagement only question before us and he urged strongly that we close conference in next day or so with agreement that Foreign Ministers reassemble here in mid-July (incidentally Soviet press spokesman at open briefing last night contrary to fairly consistent earlier expressions of optimism stated that conference was drawing to close and gave as reason that four weeks about normal duration such affairs).</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> strongly opposed <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s view though agreed some action needed to indicate to Soviets our disquietude over their intransigeance. He said he had considered at close of yesterday’s session refusing to agree to meet today but decided against doing so on grounds newspapers would blow it up into crisis. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>’s prescription is that we should state we desire recess of four or five days to reflect and consult. He is already planning to spend weekend in London and this would extend his period there. It would also enable him to attend a Cabinet meeting which otherwise would have to be set for Sunday, evoking memories of last Sunday Cabinet meeting at height Suez crisis.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>’s main argument, however, was concentrated on increased desirability of summit meeting, believing we had now reached point on matter of our rights which only heads of government could resolve. He believes West Berlin civilian population susceptible insidiously slow strangulation in absence of reaching new agreements with Soviets on access. Agreement he optimistically believes would ensure freedom and economic life West Berlin until day reunification comes. Question of rights in his mind becoming almost theological point. As I followed his argument he would seek detailed terms of agreement here which would then be presented to summit conference with preface pointing out West had one view on continuing validity its basic rights and Soviet another. Heads would then decide which basic view would prevail and he based expectation favorable decision on combination <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s vanity and your persuasiveness. He was unmoved by argument <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s Budapest statement had internally and externally nailed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s personal prestige to the mast and that public backdown at summit hence improbable. (At one point he characterized <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s statement as impetuous inadvertence rather than calculated pronouncement.) He referred to risks of war and at one point stated that he considered <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> a madman like Hitler capable of anything.</p>
<p>I did not commit myself to either view though I think it was obvious I found <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>’s arguments in good part unacceptable. I told them that I would have to await instructions in reply to a message I was despatching to you giving my estimate of where we now stood.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_863" n="863" facs="0888"/>
<p>At <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>’s suggestion we will meet again today at noon privately at my villa without the Germans or advisers. Incidentally neither <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> at any point suggested that I talk to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> privately in effort to break deadlock. I suspect you will shortly be receiving a message from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName> urging decision along lines <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> proposes.</p>

<p>In yesterday’s private meeting as reported last night we presented revised talking paper contained <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 90.<note n="1" xml:id="d375fn1">Document 372.</note> <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked clarification on some details but said overall impression was that points represented no change in substance from previous Western positions. Ensuing discussion revolved about status of our rights, Soviet attitude toward its commitments and fate of people of West Berlin.</p>
<p>When I made point that there was hardly any use talking if we did not know where we stood on our rights, he seemed very anxious to move on to discussion of other elements, particularly the question of troops. None of us rose to the bait. When pressed to the corner on rights his remarks made it clear that there would be no legal basis for the new agreement they want other than right of occupation and the only justification would be that it would improve the situation (as they see it). The statement by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> of June 8 which was read at meeting clearly worked to harden <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s attitude on rights from <pb xml:id="pg_864" n="864" facs="0889"/>his frequent assertions on Saturday<note n="2" xml:id="d375fn2">See <ref target="#d369">Document 369</ref>.</note> that while they wanted no mention of rights in the agreement, they did not take a negative stand toward them. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did say the question of rights could be dealt with after the character of arrangements on the other points was determined but he made clear that his position, like <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s, is that the occupation regime in West Berlin must be terminated. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> were firm maintaining Western position on rights.</p>
<p>I do not know if it is significant but at our private meetings <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has steadily been increasing numbers his delegation present. For first two meetings in accordance the understanding reached to which rest have adhered, he arrived with only <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> and interpreter.

<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>I met this noon at my villa with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> as agreed last evening.<note n="1" xml:id="d376fn1">See <ref target="#d374">Document 374</ref>.</note> We continued discussion of the best next step in the light of the present conference deadlock. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> reiterated the belief that the West should take the initiative in suggesting adjournment until <pb xml:id="pg_865" n="865" facs="0890"/>mid-July. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> after overnight consideration seemed inclined to agree.

I indicated the clear belief that some action was necessary to impress <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> with our seriousness but said I desired to reserve expressing an opinion on the various alternatives open to us until I had heard from you which might be tonight or tomorrow. We agreed to maintain the secrecy of our discussions and to meet again as soon as I received your expected message.</p>

<p>At private meeting today at Secretary’s Villa <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> presented set of new proposals described as taking into account Western positions <pb xml:id="pg_866" n="866" facs="0891"/>expressed in recent meetings. He said Soviet Union would not insist on immediate complete abrogation of occupation status of West Berlin. It could accept temporary maintenance of certain Western occupation rights in West Berlin for one year period. During this period an all-German committee of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GFR1">GFR</gloss> on parity basis should work out problem of reunification; agree on principles of a peace treaty; and facilitate development and broadening of contacts between each other. One year limit would be fixed for successful completion of negotiations in order prevent West Germany from delaying peace treaty indefinitely.</p>
<p>Soviet Union would agree to temporary one-year recognition of certain occupation rights in West Berlin on basis following conditions:</p>
<p>1. Western powers to reduce the level of forces and armaments to symbolic number.</p>
<p>2. Hostile propaganda against <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and other Socialist countries from territory of West Berlin to be stopped.</p>
<p>3. All organizations in West Berlin engaged in espionage and hostile activities against <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and other Socialist countries to be liquidated.</p>
<p>4. Western powers to assume obligation not to station atomic or rocket installations in West Berlin.</p>
<p>If these conditions accepted, USSR ready to maintain communications between West Berlin and outside world as now exist.</p>
<p>All above would constitute provisional status of West Berlin. This status would be guaranteed first by four powers, on basis of protocol of guarantee submitted by Soviet Union; secondly, by government of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> which has expressed in principle its willingness to respect agreed status of West Berlin. Soviet Union willing to make access commitments either in general agreement on West Berlin status or in separate document as Western powers desire. Documents would be registered with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
<p>If understanding reached making West Berlin free demilitarized city in conformity with Soviet proposals as put forward at this conference, access commitments would be maintained until reunification of Germany.</p>
<p>In view of Soviets, there should be four power supervisory commission to watch out for violations of agreements and to take appropriate measures to ensure fulfillment agreement without touching sovereign rights of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said if Western powers would not agree to above, he wanted to stress that Soviet Union will not give consent that present regime in West Berlin be continued. If Western powers or West Germany hampered achievement of peace treaty within time limit, Soviet Union with other belligerents in war with Germany would be compelled to sign own peace treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_867" n="867" facs="0892"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> refused to furnish paper on proposals to other Ministers but indicated he would put his proposals forward at tomorrow’s plenary meeting.<note n="1" xml:id="d377fn1">See <ref target="#d381">Document 381</ref>.</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> claimed time limit on work of All-German Committee similar to time limit we set for All-German Committee. Secretary pointed out their action at conclusion of committee’s work if agreement not reached would be unilateral peace treaty step, our action would be making progress on reunification by submitting both plans to the German people for vote.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> commented that Soviet offer was really accompanied by threat. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> remarked that we were being asked to accept 95 percent if not 100 percent of Soviet demands and being given one-year’s grace with curtailed rights to accept it. Secretary stated this amounted to postponing May 27 ultimatum to one-year from beginning of All-German Committee work.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> denied threat of signing peace treaty was really threat. It had long been discussed in Soviet statements and mentioned often here at Conference. This was different from West’s action on such agreements with <gloss target="#t_GFR1">GFR</gloss> as Paris Accords and on atomic weapons and missile bases.<note n="2" xml:id="d377fn2">For texts of the Nine- and Four-Power Agreements, signed at Paris, October 23, 1954, see <ref target="frus1952-54v05p2"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1952–1954, vol. V, Part 2</ref>, pp. 1435–1457; for text of the agreement for cooperation on the uses of atomic energy for mutual defense, signed at Bonn May 5, 1959, see 10 UST 1322.</note> Soviets were merely stating how they understood situation. If they signed peace treaty without warning this would be “fait accompli.” West had in past taken position if Soviets would not agree on method of reunifying Germany, then they would proceed (as in fact they did) with agreements rearming <gloss target="#t_GFR1">GFR</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He claimed we had told Soviet Union in San Francisco in 1951 that if they did not join us we would conclude separate peace treaty with Japan and then did. When it was pointed out we had preserved Soviet rights, he said Soviets had been interested in Japan becoming peace loving country posing no threat to anyone but instead rights had been granted for foreign military bases and foreign troops. In answer to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s question as to what would be position of our troops after Soviets signed peace treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> first sought to evade answer by saying Soviet desire was to reach negotiated agreement. He finally said in effect that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would then become sovereign nation to which occupation rights would not be applicable.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 90. For Secretary from Acting Secretary. After our telephone conversation<note n="1" xml:id="d378fn1">No record of the telephone conversation has been found.</note> I discussed <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 91 and 92<note n="2" xml:id="d378fn2">Documents 373 and 374.</note> with the President and gave him your brief report on today’s meeting. The President asked me to answer your telegrams and to tell you that in view of the rapidly changing circumstances he felt that final decision should be left in your hands.</p>
<p>He agrees with the idea of a private talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> provided <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> are agreeable and provided the situation still permits such a conversation. The President was in accord with the general line of your suggested démarche to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. We talked of the question of our rights and the President indicated that he would be satisfied if we maintained them by any means that you found satisfactory. Specifically he saw no objection to your thought that it might be possible to preserve them by a unilateral declaration not objected to by the Soviets. The President also indicated his hope that there might be some agreement at Geneva to increase individual contacts between East and West Germany as he feels this could only redound to the advantage of the West.</p>
<p>I then showed the President some excerpts from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech at Budapest, in particular <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s remarks regarding a possible summit conference. The President reacted strongly and said that we should make clear that we could not allow a break-up of the Foreign Ministers Conference without results on any theory that the Ministers lacked authority to reach agreement and that only heads of government were competent to make agreements. He pointed out that in the case of the US and the other Western powers the Foreign Ministers are the official representatives of the governments and can make decisions on their own within the broad outlines of governmental policy. The President suggested that you might tell <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> this and in particular say to him that you as Secretary of State have the President’s full confidence and are authorized to make agreements which will be backed up by the United States. To imply otherwise and to deny the competence of Foreign Ministers would be to deny the validity of the whole diplomatic process. The President thought you might bring this view out in public at anytime you felt it would be useful.</p>
<p>Should there be a breakdown we in the Department feel that there is considerable merit in <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s suggestion of a thirty-day cooling-off <pb xml:id="pg_869" n="869" facs="0894"/>period. The President agreed that this might be a practicable course provided you and your British and French associates feel it desirable. The main burden of the President’s views was that in view of the rapidly changing situation he thought that you should feel fully free to take whatever action you thought best at tomorrow’s plenary.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="italic">Secretary’s Evaluation of Conference Outlook</hi></p>
<p>1. The Secretary said that today would be crucial in view of the Russian ultimatum given to us yesterday at the private meeting.<note n="1" xml:id="d379fn1">See <ref target="#d377">Document 377</ref>.</note> He then outlined the substance of the Russian proposal commenting that it took us back to November 27; we have retrogressed seriously. He noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> had prepared a good draft of a statement<note n="2" xml:id="d379fn2">Presumably this is the statement circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/43, June 11, which is printed in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting,</hi> pp. 267–271 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 157–160.</note> for him to make at the plenary session today. The Secretary continued that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had refused to give us a paper embodying the Russian proposal. He observed that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> for the last two days had spoken in Russian and that there were more Russian advisers present. No doubt, the Secretary surmised, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was speaking for their benefit. He thought <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would publicize the Russian proposal at the plenary <pb xml:id="pg_870" n="870" facs="0895"/>today. Obviously, he continued, we are at the break-off point if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> puts up his proposal today. The Secretary then suggested we might consider recessing until July 20. The French feel this is the best thing to do now and that the British, although hesitant at first, appear to think it is the best move. The Secretary said it was necessary for us to point out that the Russian proposal is an ultimatum. He concluded by saying that we have reached a serious point in negotiations and the prospects are not cheery.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Conference Tactics</hi></p>
<p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> thought that there was an important difference between this ultimatum and the ultimatum of November 27 which, as he argued it, seemed to lie in the fact that the present proposal would not become a threat unless or until we accepted it. He suggested that we should guard our flank against <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> saying at the plenary session today that what he was putting forward was a proposal and not an ultimatum. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> expressed the view that we should publish the Common Declaration or Communiqué we gave the Russians on June 8<note n="3" xml:id="d379fn3">See <ref target="#d372">Document 372</ref>.</note> in order to bring out as soon as possible our position if the conference should break up. The Secretary thought that since this is really our minimum position there would be disadvantages in disclosing it at this time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> suggested that if the Soviets refuse a recess and break off the conference, we should then publish our offer.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> suggested that the Secretary not propose a recess at first; a private session could be held. Afterwards we might propose a recess. The Secretary said that we made it clear yesterday to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that this proposal is a threat. He thought it interesting that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> refused to give us the text of his proposal, but instead said he wished to do so at the plenary session. The Secretary digressed to comment on the dangers that faced the Alliance. He thought that the Russians may very well be acting tough because they think that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is about to break up (viz. the French attitude) and that there are internal strains in the UK (viz. recent criticism of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Press Matters</hi></p>
<p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said that we should create the impression in the press that the present situation has been produced by the new Soviet move and that the conference has really been thrown back to November 27 last. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> said that he thought an abrupt recess would cause concern all over the world and he thought it important to place the onus for this directly on the Soviets. In this connection Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted Mr. <pb xml:id="pg_871" n="871" facs="0896"/><persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> is preparing a question and answer guidance for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName>.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Possible Recourse to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on Berlin Issue</hi></p>
<p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> expressed the view that the Russian proposal may have been calculated to force us to break off negotiations and thus open the way for the Russians to conclude a peace treaty with East Germany within two or three days. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> agreed that this might be a deliberate move. If a treaty appeared to be in prospect, we should consider moving into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as soon as it was signed. The Secretary said there was no question about this and asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> whether he had prepared a draft resolution for the Security Council. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> indicated that he had done so<note n="4" xml:id="d379fn4">The draft resolution has not been found.</note> and that the problem was being studied in Washington this week. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> said that if there is a recess followed by signature of a peace treaty, we must be sure that our case is as clean as is possible. We must be able to say we did all we could to continue the negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that we would be covered by having suggested a recess. If the Soviets act unilaterally, during this time it will be they who will bear the onus.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Briefing on Private Meeting for Germans</hi></p>
<p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that the British had agreed to brief <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> on yesterday’s meeting but wanted to defer doing so until this morning. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> came into the Delegation Office last night at 11 o’clock asking to see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> to get a run-down of the private meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that he had given <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> a sanitized version of the private meeting to be transmitted only to <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d379fn5">A seven-line memorandum for the record of <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>’s briefing of <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> is in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1384.</note></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Stand-by Plane for Secretary</hi></p>
<p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> expressed the view that it would be wise psychologically and otherwise for the Secretary to order a plane to stand by. (See attached telegrams—<gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 100 and <gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 92.)<note n="6" xml:id="d379fn6"><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 100, June 10, requested that a plane be put on standby.

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 99. For Acting Secretary from Secretary. I am most grateful for message from President contained <gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 90.<note n="1" xml:id="d380fn1">Document 378.</note></p>
<p>I met this morning with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d380fn2">At 10:15 a.m.</note> and read them paraphrase your cable and then read draft statement I had prepared overnight<note n="3" xml:id="d380fn3">See <ref target="#d379fn2">footnote 2, Document 379</ref>.</note> totally rejecting <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s proposal if he repeats it as expected at this afternoon’s plenary.</p>
<p>We three agreed:</p>
<p>(1) Best not to break off conference but propose recess until July 15.</p>
<p>(2) Request no meeting tomorrow but plenary Friday, at which time one of us (supported by other two) would make statement persuasively presenting and explaining five-point proposal given <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in private session June 8,<note n="4" xml:id="d380fn4">See <ref target="#d372">Document 372</ref>.</note> thus leaving public record in best possible condition should conference in fact be terminated by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> refusal to agree resumption date.</p>
<p>(3) At session today we would give no hint of any request for month’s recess. This would be done at Friday’s plenary.</p>
<p>(4) Meanwhile it was agreed that I should see <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> alone tomorrow afternoon when both <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> will have received as they expect their governments’ authority to propose recess.</p>
<p>We recognized this delay may enable <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to fuel his proposal sufficiently to make its unacceptability less clearcut but believe this risk outweighed by desirability obtaining opportunity to deliver well prepared statement Friday re West interim solution for Berlin. Importance latter accentuated by recognition Soviets might move suddenly on <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> peace treaty thereby increasing likelihood reference Berlin to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
<p>Von <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> then joined us and we went over substantially same ground with his concurring in our conclusions. He stated positively that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> proposal of yesterday would have no resonance in Germany even with <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss>. He felt recess rather than end conference far best course since otherwise spotlight would be focused on possible summit which under present circumstances he considered would be fatal.</p>
<p>The four of us then agreed that we would each communicate to our own press correspondents terms of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s proposal (which have <pb xml:id="pg_873" n="873" facs="0898"/>been given out right and left by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> to Communist reporters who in turn have leaked to other members press corps) and characterize it as unacceptable as well as very possibly designed to break up conference. There was no dissent from expressed view that it would be worse than futile to continue conference on present basis. Choice was between termination and recess. Suggestion was made which found general favor but no definitive agreement that Deputies to Foreign Ministers be asked meet in Geneva July 8 to prepare ground for reopening Ministers meeting week thereafter.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> speculated on possibility Soviets genuinely thought yesterday’s proposal a concession. This view was not shared, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> characterizing it in terms “<persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> won out over <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>”. We briefly discussed joint visit for few hours to Berlin en route home but no decision taken. I am hosting luncheon here Friday for <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> with <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> attending.</p>
<p>I emphasized to my colleagues that overriding consideration was maintaining the unity of our alliance in face Soviet maneuvers and I mentioned possibility <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> might have been deceived into thinking us weak and potentially divided by reason of certain regrettable internal developments in some of our countries. I can honestly say that I do not believe my relations have ever been as good with my three colleagues as they are today. We are all in good spirit.</p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> opened with twenty-minute presentation devoted new Soviet proposals on West Berlin (identical proposals advanced June 9 <pb xml:id="pg_874" n="874" facs="0899"/>private meeting).<note n="1" xml:id="d381fn1">For text of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/41, June 10, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting,</hi> pp. 260–266 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 152–157.

Regarding the Soviet proposals of June 9, see <ref target="#d377">Document 377</ref>.</note> Charged main obstacle any agreement on Berlin results from West’s insistence maintain at all costs outmoded occupation regime. Soviets therefore taking important additional step to contribute success of conference by new proposals providing for temporary maintenance of certain Western occupation rights West Berlin for limited period one year. During this year, All-German Committee to be established basis parity for <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to promote greater contacts between two Germanies, prepare for German unification and consider peace treaty. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stressed parity basis essential for negotiations between equal partners. Re West Berlin, claimed Soviets entitled to require certain steps be taken in agreeing to continue temporary occupation rights. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stipulated four requirements West Berlin: reduction Western forces and armaments to token levels; termination of hostile propaganda against <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and other Socialist countries; liquidation all organizations for espionage and subversion against <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and other Socialist countries; and ban on atomic or rocket installations. If four conditions accepted, Soviets willing continue present communications between West Berlin and outside world.</p>
<p>Above provisional status West Berlin to be guaranteed by four powers as well as <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. And if agreement reached on Soviet “free city” proposals already made, guarantees re West Berlin’s communications would be maintained until Germany unified.

<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> warned that if West refuses carry out these proposals for West Berlin, Soviets not prepared to permit continuance occupation rights, and that if West blocks carrying out of agreed measures within year’s time, Soviets and others would feel compelled to sign peace treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 93. Following message for the Secretary from the President.</p>
<p>“June 10, 1959</p>
<p>Dear Chris:</p>
<p>Yesterday was one of my busiest days, starting at seven and, without respite, ending at 11:30 as I arrived back at the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House from Atlantic City. Because of my preoccupations I could not personally answer your cable asking for certain decisions,<note n="1" xml:id="d382fn1">See <ref target="#d378">Document 378</ref>.</note> and I suggested to <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, after a personal conference with him, that he do so on my behalf. I am sure that he reflected my views accurately.</p>
<p>Of course we stand firm on the conclusion that I cannot attend any so-called Summit meeting unless there is sufficient progress in your present meeting to give some hope of accomplishment at the projected later meeting. I continue to believe that it would be not only a mistake but a great disservice to the world to go to a Summit meeting that would be barren of promise.</p>
<p>In this connection I suggested to <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> that you might find it useful to remind your colleagues at the Conference that the United States does not send her Secretary of State to an international conference to act as an errand boy. Consequently, from our viewpoint, there is no validity to any argument that a Summit meeting would be certain to bring about some beneficial results, while a Foreign Ministers meeting would be certain to show complete failure. Within the limits of policy approved by the President, the Secretary of State has considerable latitude as to tactics and substantive detail. Incidentally, this demand for so-called Summit talks is a rather modern development. The history of the meetings that have been held does not impress me as presenting a record of brilliant accomplishments.</p>
<p>With respect to the matter of assurances on our rights and responsibilities in Berlin, I have little concern as to the manner of its accomplishment so long as there can be no possible mistake of our common understanding, including the understanding of all other governments.</p>
<p>I rather concur in the thought that a recess might be a better tactical move than complete cessation of the meeting. If, of course, there were some unexpected break and some clear and definite progress should be <pb xml:id="pg_877" n="877" facs="0902"/>accomplished, then the entire situation would be changed. The present outlook for such accomplishment seems to be indeed dim.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how pleased I am with the obvious skill with which you have conducted these difficult negotiations on the part of our government. Your combination of firmness and correct deportment and conciliatory attitude is commanding the respect of all thoughtful readers.</p>
<p>With warm regard,</p>
<p>Sincerely, DE”</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 396.1–GE/5–2359) <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 212, June 9, reported that the question of the site for holding the election of the President of the Federal Republic of Germany had not been raised recently by <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName>. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 396.1–GE/6–959)</note> We are informed Secretary will be briefed June 11 re <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName>’s views on question holding election Federal President Berlin. These views made known to us and lead to following observations:</p>
<p>We confronted with dilemma which intensified by hectic German political conflict triggered off by <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> decision remain on as Chancellor. Our views and actions must reflect developments in Geneva conference taking place over next 48 hours.</p>
<p>We continue believe we must leave burden of decision whether Berlin to be site of election to Germans, and that failure to hold election in Berlin could be heavily damaging blow to Berlin morale at crucial point in East-West relations.</p>
<p>We gave our tacit approval to holding Presidential election Berlin in 1954. Bundestag has been meeting Berlin since 1955. If Germans <pb xml:id="pg_878" n="878" facs="0903"/>decide on Berlin for 1959 election, Western powers, as occupiers Berlin, should assure members of Federal Assembly that we will underwrite the security of their presence in Berlin, and their ability to travel to and from Berlin. This assurance should go long way to reducing absenteeism which <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName> concerned about.</p>
<p>We assume that on July 1 the conference will either be standing in recess or adjourned sine die. Under these circumstances Allied initiative to veto holding Presidential election in Berlin or failure to assure protection to movement of Federal Assembly members to and from Berlin could cripple morale in Berlin, and cause serious deterioration confidence of Germans and others in firmness Allied purpose. Election of Federal President in Berlin has elements of symbolic importance, particularly as relating to aspirations to reunification, which should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>East German threats to retaliate if elections held in Berlin presently emerging from low level. If it discerned that Western powers retreating in face of these threats, East Germans and Soviets will undoubtedly be encouraged to make further efforts to prove out their pretensions that West Berlin part of territory of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Should be noted 1954 elections and annual Bundestag Meetings have not excited any similar actions or threats.</p>
<p>We appreciate problem of absenteeism caused by holding elections in Berlin, and whether Berlin votes made to count, could make outcome of election problematical now that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> has withdrawn his candidacy. Factor in this problem is whether <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> can be rallied round new candidate.</p>
<p>Secretary will be hearing very firm views <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> this question. Seems important not to dishearten Berlin leader on whom we depend, although we appreciate this must be weighed against displeasure of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> that Western powers unwilling to take this decision for him. He undoubtedly looks to us to take the action which will settle issue the way he wants it settled. We judge <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> not giving primary consideration effect on Berlin morale of transfer of site of election, but sees problem more in coldly partisan light hurtful effect on <gloss target="#t_CDU1">CDU</gloss> chances of holding election Berlin.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 105. I called on <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at his villa at four this afternoon as arranged. I had <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> with me. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was attended by <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> and an interpreter who incidentally is extremely poor.</p>
<p>Just prior to this call I had met with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> at which meeting we had agreed that I would not propose recess but would confine myself to impressing on <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seriousness with which we took last two days’ developments with particular reference to ultimative aspect of proposal he had introduced Tuesday in private session and then insisted on making public at Wednesday’s plenary. Abandonment proposal to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> today of three or four week recess was in large part based on <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s communication to me during morning of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s objections and fact that <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had July commitments which made difficult establishment resumption date for conference.<note n="1" xml:id="d384fn1"><persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> talked with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> at 11:45 a.m. and the Foreign Secretary told him that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was opposed to a lengthy recess in the conference. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested that it would be better not to raise the question with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> until he had a chance to raise the question at a British Cabinet meeting on Monday, June 15. (Memorandum of conversation, US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/94; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1340)</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> received me in serious but friendly manner. We talked for nearly two hours but he insisted on speaking Russian himself and having my remarks translated to him in Russian despite his fluency in English. Apart from reiteration his disclaimers any intent to pose threat or ultimatum (which disclaimer he authorized me to announce to press) there was little of real significance which emerged from our talk. He rehearsed at length previously expressed arguments for Soviet proposals over past month with particular emphasis on free city. I gained distinct impression he was stalling probably in absence any reaction from Moscow to what he must have reported last night concerning strength of Western reaction to his proposal. In any event he gave no serious indication of regarding this, my first private bilateral talk with him, as welcome initiation of series US-Soviet dialogues. We meet tomorrow at ten in plenary and we agreed to resume private meetings Monday with my parting emphasis on fact that results such private meetings for first three days of next week would determine fate of conference. Detailed report of conversation follows.</p>
<p>Secretary opened by stating he had certain matters on his mind relating to justification for continuing negotiations. He said <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s <pb xml:id="pg_880" n="880" facs="0905"/>proposal presented at private meeting<note n="2" xml:id="d384fn2">See <ref target="#d377">Document 377</ref>.</note> to us had been so disturbing as to result in his requesting that aircraft for return to Washington be placed on four-hour alert. His impression was that, as confirmed at plenary yesterday,<note n="3" xml:id="d384fn3">See <ref target="#d381">Document 381</ref>.</note> Soviets in effect were putting up ultimatum for solution Berlin and conclusion treaty with <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> which made it almost impossible to contemplate continuation present negotiations. He realized that Soviet spokesman previous evening had asserted no dictate was intended but wording of proposal seemed to place it on take it or leave it basis giving no indication that it was document subject to negotiation. Furthermore had suggested strangulation access to Berlin when separate treaty was signed.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that he came to Geneva with authority from President to negotiate agreement. There were however certain principles approved by the President which underlay US position as follows: (1) no negotiation under threats presence of which would of course make Summit impossible; (2) allies have certain rights and Soviets certain obligations with respect to Berlin which cannot be unilaterally abrogated but only modified by consent of parties; and (3) West Berliners view us not as occupiers but as their protectors against surrounding hostile forces.</p>
<p>The Secretary went on to say the President had reaffirmed to him after <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s Budapest statement that as Secretary of State he speaks for US Government with authority enter into agreements, within broad policy guidelines, which US Government will honor. In absence such authority diplomatic process breaks down and if Foreign Ministers can make no progress how can Heads of Government expect to.</p>
<p>Secretary said his purpose in call was not to negotiate but to avoid misunderstanding by making clear that progress at conference was necessarily within limits of what US could agree to and by securing clarification of apparent ultimative aspects of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s proposal of day before.</p>
<p>The Secretary concluded by saying that he sought to satisfy himself that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement constituted proposal for negotiation and not fixation of conditions with time limit accompanied by announcement specific actions would be taken at end of specified time limit. If progress was to be made hard work and frankness were required. Unhappily previous day’s plenary session has turned us back to last November.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then asked if the Secretary’s time permitted the use of an interpreter and, upon the Secretary’s agreement, the conversation was thenceforth conducted through him.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_881" n="881" facs="0906"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> opened by stating formally that he considered bilateral exchange of views between Ministers useful as well as Conference sessions. As to substance, he said that when he had outlined new Soviet proposal on Tuesday he had clearly stated it was not to be considered as a threat or ultimatum. He had repeated this at the plenary session and hence failed to understand why this question should again be asked. It must be assumed, he said, that Soviet Government would be obliged to act as stated in event no agreement reached. He complained over Western tendency to place false interpretations on Soviet proposals and look in every corner for evil motives.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said he understood US and allies would not negotiate under threats and he repeated that in his proposal there were no such threats or ultimatum.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then turned to Summit Conference, which he said Secretary had linked to Foreign Ministers Conference. To Soviets, he said, a Summit Conference is too important to be made an object of bargaining, and he added that he had understood President to say at <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House when four Foreign Ministers saw him<note n="4" xml:id="d384fn4">See <ref target="#d338">Document 338</ref>.</note> that a Summit Conference could turn the tide and end cold war if mutual desire existed to attain positive results. He said if US interested in peace then it was unthinkable to bargain over Summit Conference. “We think if one or another state such as US raised artificial barriers to Summit or series of Summits by referring to unsatisfactory results at Foreign Ministers Conference then such state assumes very heavy responsibility.”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Secretary should understand Soviet reaction when told Summit depended on Ministers’ talks, which in effect meant Soviets must pay concessions to secure Summit. In fact he said it made Soviets think in terms of ultimatum being put to them.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> resumed with reference to Secretary’s second point, which he described as Allied occupation rights and regime in West Berlin. He said Soviet position clear it could not agree to occupation regime for indefinite period of time notwithstanding apparent Western satisfaction with present situation. Soviets and <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> do not like it and believe West Berlin source of daily friction. He then detailed inconsequential incident of recent chase of Algerian by two French military policemen across <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> border, concluding with statement that such incidents frequent and will not all be insignificant.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then reverted to earlier Soviet proposal for Free City and repeated in detail arguments already used in its support. He did however place emphasis on variant involving symbolic quadripartite troop contingents which he said would create “new qualitative status” with <pb xml:id="pg_882" n="882" facs="0907"/>access thereby assured as well as guarantees for regime. He said he considered this “good way out for Western allies” and asked why we were frightened of this proposal.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> went on that, having met wall of resistance, Soviet decided to submit its last proposal, which provided for a short period of continuation occupation status on curtailed basis. This was linked with establishment all-German committee toward which he had been surprised Western Ministers had not on previous day reflected positive attitude.</p>
<p>The Secretary interrupted <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at this point to say he had no desire to retread history of previous month but had called to talk on (1) the threat or ultimatum aspect of Soviet proposal, and (2) prospect for Summit Conference. On first point, Secretary said he hoped for precision from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on denial ultimative appearance. Conditions posed for continuing occupation were humiliating, almost insulting. Threat was that at year-end rights would be extinguished and both civil and military access placed in hands of <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> with power strangulation without reference our rights or Soviet obligations. The Secretary said he trusted this threatening element would be removed and that Soviets would make clear proposal was put forward for negotiation and not as threat, which reminded him of past history of Hitler’s dictats to inferiors.</p>
<p>On Summit Conference, Secretary noted, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said in effect no relation existed with Ministers’ Conference. Secretary could not share this view and recalled that during entire exchange of notes emphasis was placed on purpose of Foreign Ministers to prepare way for profitable Summit which could discuss broader issues and decide narrowed points of issue. He reminded <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that President had said on occasion referred to (as he had often stated publicly) that he would go any time anywhere to Summit if he felt it could achieve agreements and thereby lessen tensions. Hence Ministers’ task is to prepare for such a meeting. Secretary added that President had set no single specific precondition but that Ministers must provide some hope that a Summit could achieve some positive result and thereby avoid failure which would increase tensions. Definite relationship existed between present Conference and Summit but no element of ultimatum.</p>
<p>Secretary then reverted to necessity removal <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s implied threat in order to resume negotiations. He hoped after five weeks’ exchange of views groundwork was laid for some agreement. Secretary concluded by saying he hoped by hard work and long hours in first three days of next week, and assuming removal any ultimative aspect, it would be possible reach sufficient agreement to record real progress.</p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then angrily challenged Secretary’s reference to Hitlerian tactic in connection Soviet proposal and asked if intent was to aggravate situation or to provoke sharp exchange.</p>
<p>Secretary retorted he had given his own reaction to proposal and was not attempting pass judgment on Soviet intent.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said he would confine himself to substance and had nothing to add to past statements on subject threats or ultimatums. He said he interpreted Western position as making proposals and then saying if they were not accepted there could be no agreement. This was faulty method negotiation and induced Soviet belief we had no serious intention of reaching agreement. Moreover Soviets would never agree to undersigning indefinite continuation of occupation regime of Berlin.</p>
<p>Secretary replied he thought we could agree on term “indefinite.” West had no desire to keep troops in Berlin or retain occupation status forever. We sought interim agreement until reunification Germany. Since both Soviets and we agreed on this object matter could be discussed further though we could not accept Soviet position that matter exclusively for Germans themselves to decide. He reminded <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> West had made proposals going long way to meet expressed Soviet desiderata and had proposed thirty-month period for conclusion agreement on modalities with provision lack of agreement would result in Germans themselves freely expressing their desires. However he had no desire to negotiate at this meeting but wanted to make clear we ourselves have given no ultimatum but have stated firmly that our legal rights cannot be unilaterally extinguished. On free city proposal we had expressed ourselves. Secretary then said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had been clear on absence any intended threat or ultimatum in his proposal and asked if he would have any objection to Secretary telling press after meeting that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made statement to this effect.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that on Tuesday, Wednesday and again today he had said that it was incorrect to represent Soviet proposal as form of dictat and that he had no objection whatsoever to the Secretary so stating to the press.</p>
<p>The Secretary then commented that if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had used the word “indefinite” instead of “one year” the entire presentation of this proposal would have left a different impression.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> with a three quarter smile asked the Secretary not to expect any changes today in the Soviet proposal. He then observed that in the Western press there had been growing pessimism, starting a few days ago with homeopathic doses but ending today with an elephantine dosage.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that he shared that pessimism.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_884" n="884" facs="0909"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said we must now both look for an agreement which the Soviets sincerely sought. More than Soviet good will was needed however and there was no point in continuing to force our own proposals on him. He then made a joking reference to fact he had not ordered up a plane for himself, to which Secretary replied that his considered interpretation of last Soviet move had been that it represented intention and desire to end conference.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was the wrong interpretation and in fact proposal had been designed to meet our desire to retain occupation status in Berlin. He then referred to Secretary’s earlier mention of three days of private talks and said that Soviets were prepared to work long hours with no deadline set for conclusion their efforts.</p>
<p>Secretary said he considered next few days would enable arrival at conclusion as to whether any agreement was possible. In leaving <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> noted that US-USSR relations were not satisfactory, not due any lack of desire on Soviet part but because of apparent absence such desire on part US.</p>
<p>Secretary said we had expressed ourselves on this matter many times. Need now is to agree on practical measures which would lead to improvement and that he hoped present negotiation would not prove futile. Secretary then left, interview having lasted nearly two hours.</p>
<p>From <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s villa Secretary drove to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s where he reported conversation in detail to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>. Thereafter four agreed on common line to be taken with press.</p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, in twenty minute statement<note n="1" xml:id="d385fn1">For text of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s statement, circulated as <gloss target="#t_RMDOC1">RM/DOC</gloss>/46, June 12, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting,</hi> pp. 279–284 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 164–168.</note> traced course conference to date, noting Western Peace Plan put forward after much thought and designed meet Soviet criticisms of earlier Western proposals. Said conference had concentrated during past fortnight on limited proposals re Berlin and he had thought there had been some signs of limited progress on limited front until Soviet proposals made public June 10 put us back to situation at time of Soviet note November 27. These proposals contained no new element and were presented under double threat that if not accepted Soviets would turn responsibilities over to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and would do so in any case at end of one year. Soviet all-German committee proposal simply revival of idea peace treaty must be negotiated by two Germanies.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then gave background against which Soviet proposals must be viewed. West had two sorts of rights—those flowing from basic fact Nazi surrender and those based on specific agreements. Quoted <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s March twentieth statement<note n="2" xml:id="d385fn2">The statement was made at a press conference at the Kremlin on March 19 and printed in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on March 20. For an extract from the press conference, including the statement mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, see <hi rend="italic">Moskau Bonn,</hi> pp. 534–538.</note> that West had legal rights in Berlin but these would be extinguished by signature Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> treaty. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said West maintained such unilateral action would be illegal and a blow at mutual confidence.</p>
<p>West could not agree, as Soviets suggested, to say nothing re rights because no guarantee question would not again be raised by Soviets or, in Soviet view, extinguished by signature treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. However, West still believed there are ways to solve this problem. Re situation in Berlin, which both sides agree abnormal, conference has considered three facets (1) presence Western troops (2) various activities (3) free access. Re (1) and (2) <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> reviewed Western proposals, saying re (2) that if Soviets object to our formulation that arrangements would cover “greater Berlin,” we would define them as covering East and West Berlin but they must be reciprocal. Re (3) maintained Soviets cannot unilaterally tear up agreements but West thought it possible to work out way to satisfy Soviet wish to give up some of functions they now exercise. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> concluded by noting <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had asked what sort of Berlin there would be access to. Answer was one (a) that posed no military threat (idea suggested by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that West would place nuclear arms or missiles in Berlin was ridiculous); (b) where troops did not interfere with life of city; (c) where there would be freedom and no violence or subversive activities directed against its neighbor.</p>

Soviets put forward proposals for temporary Berlin regime, to facilitate liquidation outdated occupation regime. West says occupation would last only until German reunification. But reunification impossible under Western proposals. West must realize Soviets, <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and other states do not like occupation regime and desire new arrangements satisfactory to all states concerned. West says troops are no danger to Soviets and must stay in West Berlin to guarantee social order there, but why are guns needed to support an order which no one wishes to change? Re Western objection to one-year time limit for work of all-German Committee, West itself proposed two-and-one-half year limit and thus accepts principle. If one year too short, why not propose another? Re parity, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> has shown this is only arrangement compatible with facts and international law. West says membership should depend on population but this not so in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or at this conference. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> accused West of threatening Soviets by insisting on maintenance of occupation regime in West Berlin.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then turned to Summit conference, saying it cannot be approached on basis of deal that it depends on progress at Geneva. If powers really desire find solution for problems, then Summit, or series of summits, could bring about lessening of tensions and strengthening of peace. Anyone who sets “artificial obstacles” on road to summit would accept “grave responsibilities”.</p>
<p>Re <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s statement that Soviet proposals old, maintained two new elements were one year time limit and linking of Berlin proposals with activities of all-German committee. Re statement Soviet suggested ban on missiles and nuclear weapons ludicrous said what is ludicrous is attempts to minimize this issue and West should have no trouble accepting Soviet proposal. Ended by reiterating Soviet desire reach agreement but repeated Soviets could not sign agreement which perpetuated occupation regime.</p>

Soviet proposals only increase tension by linking questions which may be soluble with those which are not. Connecting all-German committee established on parity basis with proposals on Berlin is merely device for shifting to Federal Republic blame for failure this conference. Federal Republic agreed to an all-German committee on understanding it would operate within framework of Western proposals for German reunification and its membership would be based on relative populations of two Germanies. Soviet proposals re all-German committee would perpetuate split because <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> representatives would be able prevent any reunification on basis of freedom. Denied there any universal rule supporting parity principle, saying even in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> some states have certain rights not possessed by others and Soviets themselves had assigned differing role as among states they propose take part in drafting and signing treaty with two Germanies. “Free city” proposal unacceptable because would establish three Germanies and would leave West Berlin open to arbitrary interference by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Berlin Problems</item>
</list>
<p>At <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>’s request, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> saw Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> this morning at his hotel. He seemed tired after what he described as his hectic two days in Paris, but reasonably relaxed although he said he had been harassed by journalists ever since his arrival in Geneva. He wondered whether he should keep the schedule of meetings with journalists which his press officer had already arranged. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> suggested maximum discretion in dealing with the press, particularly with reference to any subject which might be discussed with the Foreign Ministers during lunch. There was always the possibility that, if he created too much of a stir in Geneva, the Soviets and East Germans might decide <pb xml:id="pg_889" n="889" facs="0914"/>they wanted to send Mayor Ebert of East Berlin here to make a personal appearance.</p>
<p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName>’s query, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said that he was now reasonably satisfied with the arrangements to keep him informed. The Federal authorities were making their daily reports available to him through the Foreign Office representative in Berlin. Moreover, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName>’s briefings had been helpful. He said he had had a long talk earlier this morning with <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> during the course of which he complained about the refusal of the German Delegation to show to the Berlin representative in Geneva, or to him, the text of the proposal made by the Western Powers on June 3, 1959.<note n="1" xml:id="d386fn1">See <ref target="#d358fn3">footnote 3, Document 358</ref>.</note> It had seemed absurd to plead secrecy as a reason for not keeping the Mayor of Berlin informed when the Soviets obviously knew all about the proposal anyway.</p>
<p>At this point Senator <persName corresp="#p_KG1">Guenther Klein</persName> entered the room and joined the conversation. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said he was seriously concerned about the situation which had developed in connection with the presidential elections. If the Federal Government had some months ago decided that it was unwise to have them in Berlin and had taken normal measures to hold the elections elsewhere, such action would have been deplored but it would not have become a major issue. However, the whole situation had been handled with maximum stupidity, and failure to hold the elections in Berlin would now be interpreted only as a sign of Western weakness by the Soviets and East Germans. He said everyone in Bonn seemed confused and was giving different reasons for not having the elections in Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> had dwelt at some length on the necessity of avoiding any action which could be criticized as a Western attempt to sabotage the process of negotiations. On the other hand, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName> who, as President of the Bundestag, had to make the ultimate decision as to where the Federal Assembly would be convened, [<hi rend="italic">3-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. Personally, <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName> had said, he favored being firm on this, but he could not contemplate being responsible for a situation in which the entire German Bundestag as well as many other leading German politicians might be stranded in Berlin. If he could be assured that the U.S. Air Force would guarantee to fly the political leaders out should access be hindered, that would make a difference.</p>
<p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> showed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> a letter which he had written to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName>, dated June 11, in which he had stressed the various arguments in favor of holding the Federal Assembly in Berlin. In this letter he emphasized the unfavorable effect on the Soviets, as well as on the Western negotiating position at the conference, which such an <pb xml:id="pg_890" n="890" facs="0915"/>evident sign of Western weakness would have [3 <hi rend="italic">lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gerstenmaier</persName> would have to make up his mind in the next day or so, but was more or less committed not to do so until he (<persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>) had returned from Geneva and spoken to him tomorrow. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said that he had seen a memorandum of conversation drawn up by the German Delegation covering the May 22 meeting at which <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> had first raised the question of the Presidential elections with the other three Foreign Ministers.<note n="2" xml:id="d386fn2">See <ref target="#d325">Document 325</ref>.</note> It was quite clear to him from this that, while the Western Foreign Ministers had expressed preference for holding the elections elsewhere than in Berlin, they had certainly not made the kind of specific recommendations which the German Foreign Office had alleged, nor had they taken the initiative in raising the question in the first place, as <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> had apparently informed certain correspondents. (In a brief subsequent conversation with Senat Press Chief Hirschfeld, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> was informed that Sidney Gruson of <hi rend="italic">The New York Times,</hi> who is one of the correspondents to whom <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> had allegedly said this, was filing an article today asserting that <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName> had deliberately deceived him as well as other Western correspondents as to who had taken the initiative in this matter.)</p>
<p>Both Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> and Senator <persName corresp="#p_KG1">Klein</persName> talked at some length about their concern at that “failure” of the Western Powers during the conference to drive home the point that Berlin’s associations with the Federal Republic, both political and economic, must be maintained. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> admitted that he, as a leading proponent of the “Haupstadt Berlin” movement, which supports greater use of Berlin as the capital of the Federal Republic, had advocated action which went considerably beyond that which the Western Allies had considered practicable. However, he felt it somewhat unfortunate that the emphasis in the conference had been so completely on Three Power responsibility with nothing much said about the de facto relationship with the Federal Republic which had grown up. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> noted that freedom of access, as well as maintenance of the right of Berlin to choose its own social system, obviously implied continuation of the links with the Federal Republic, if the Berliners desired to maintain them. This was so implicit that failure specifically to underline it on every occasion did not mean it was not in the minds of the Western Ministers.</p>

Both <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, who was present, and I felt <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was stalling for time in the absence of any word from Moscow resulting from the strong reaction of the Western Ministers to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s proposal.</p>
<p>Because of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s strong objection to a recess for more than two weeks and previous engagements which would keep <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> away in the event of resumption, we agreed not to recommend a recess but to try early next week in three days of intensive talks to see if any material progress could be made. I am afraid that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> made a commitment in Moscow to press for a Summit meeting regardless of the outcome here and that this is making <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>’s position very difficult. In my opinion the outlook is still dim.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 107. For the President from the Secretary.</p>
<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>I had a talk with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> today. We were both in a somewhat depressed frame of mind because we were unable as yet to see anything coming from this conference which would justify your going to a Summit meeting. I know <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> feels the same way.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> was particularly disturbed because he felt this might mean a break between the three of us since he knew <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was committed to a Summit regardless of the outcome here. On the spur of the moment, I tossed out the suggestion that perhaps <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s best way of accomplishing his end would be to issue personal invitations to yourself, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> to come to London and join with him for <pb xml:id="pg_893" n="893" facs="0918"/>conversations on matters of mutual concern without an agenda. I added that I had not talked to you or anyone else about this thought so that it could certainly not be considered a suggestion from my government. I pointed out that if <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> wanted to do this, it would save all the embarrassments connected with fending off many other nations which would want to attend a formal summit and might appeal to you if <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> could be persuasive enough in his expression of confidence that such a meeting would be productive. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> seemed to be greatly taken with the idea as being one which might be tremendously helpful to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in his forthcoming political campaign.</p>
<p>My guess is that if we find we can make no headway next week <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will then discuss a Summit conference. He today repeated in the plenary session<note n="1" xml:id="d389fn1">See <ref target="#d385">Document 385</ref>.</note> that there could be no bargaining here in Geneva with respect to what would justify a Summit conference, completely ignoring statements made by the three powers in the exchange of notes leading up to this conference. I think we should be firm in not discussing a Summit if nothing is accomplished here. If <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>, on his return Monday, should come back to question me on my off-the-cuff suggestion, I would greatly appreciate your views. I have not told him that I was communicating with you.</p>
<p>Faithfully,</p>
<p>Signed; Chris.”</p>

<p>The President telephoned from Gettysburg to refer to <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 107 of June 12<note n="1" xml:id="d391fn1">Document 389.</note> and asked what I thought about it. I told him that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and I had discussed the message late last evening and that we were both puzzled about the apparent inconsistency of the suggestion that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> issue an invitation to the President, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">DeGaulle</persName> to come to London and join with him for conversations without an agenda and the statement made later in the message that we should be firm in not discussing a Summit, if nothing is accomplished in Geneva.</p>
<p>The President said that he agreed that this would be an unacceptable proposal and that he was rather startled by it for the simple reason that everyone would regard such a meeting as suggested in London as a Summit meeting. He failed to see any difference. I said that we thought that in the light of the public position that the President has taken on this problem that the present suggestion could hardly be accepted. The President said that he was not bothered so much because he had taken the position publicly, as he was over the feeling that no other position could reasonably be taken. He was turning over in his mind whether it might not be wise at this stage for him to send a personal message to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in effect saying that, while the President would be ready to agree that final agreements perhaps could only be made at some form of Summit meeting, an impossible situation is created when it is asserted on the Russian side that the Foreign Ministers can only be regarded as errand boys and incapable of concluding any agreement of substance. It would be suggested that some kind of a concession on the Berlin and German problem would be essential.</p>
<p>I said that I would discuss this with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, but that it seemed to me a rather good approach, subject to what the Secretary’s reaction might be at Geneva. I mentioned that both <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> are absent in their capitals over the week end, and that it might be well to send an urgent message to the Secretary seeking his <pb xml:id="pg_895" n="895" facs="0920"/>reaction. The President agreed, saying that he would contemplate that the message to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> be drafted in conciliatory terms. He also asked that the Department try its hand at a preliminary draft of such a message, pending the Secretary’s reaction. He thought this could be telephoned to him at Gettysburg.<note n="2" xml:id="d391fn2">At 3 p.m. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> summarized this conversation in <gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 102 to Geneva and asked for <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s reaction to the idea of sending a message to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1332) Four hours later a draft of the message was transmitted to Geneva in <gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 104. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>) On June 14 the U.S. Delegation informed the British of the President’s negative reaction to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> calling a meeting in London. In <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 111, June 14, <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> cabled that he approved the idea of sending a communication to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, but not until the Western powers had seen <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s position in the meeting on June 15.

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 112. For Acting Secretary from the Secretary. We meet with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in private session at 5:30 this afternoon at <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s Villa and will telephone <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> results. At 3:15 <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">von Brentano</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and myself are getting together, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> being due to arrive at three from London after attendance this morning’s Cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>This morning<note n="1" xml:id="d392fn1"><persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> at noon.</note> I called on <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> who had returned last evening from Paris. He is serene and as I had expected confirmed in his tough and I think realistic line by his talks over the weekend with Debre and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.</p>
<p>In reviewing together situation as it now stands we were agreed likelihood <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> will return with instructions to continue conference in indefatigable effort to assure summit meeting this summer. Both <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and I are completely satisfied that if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continues to insist on discussing his new proposal and refuses in effect to return to negotiating <pb xml:id="pg_896" n="896" facs="0921"/>position as it existed last Monday then it is not only futile but probably productive of increased tensions to continue this sterile dialogue. Under such circumstances we both favor recessing this conference until mid July. This however will go hard with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and may well be rejected by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> who has been confirming our estimate that he is seeking to drive us to a summit conference by the crisis route rather than by any significant agreement here. British fascination for a summit for summit’s sake of course probably contributes to Soviet belief that this maneuver will be successful.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> remains absolutely adamant on unwisdom of a summit conference on such a basis. This, as <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said, is “more for reasons of prudence than prestige” since an unsuccessful summit would have such serious consequences. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> added (and please protect him) that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had said that if there were a summit meeting under such circumstances he himself would refuse to go even if President attended. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and I agreed that this afternoon and if necessary tomorrow we would resolutely seek to return <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to discussion of our old five-point paper,<note n="2" xml:id="d392fn2">See <ref target="#d372">Document 372</ref>.</note> possibly indicating orally if course of conversation so warranted that in first paragraph we could accept clear implicit treatment of our rights rather than explicit language.</p>
<p>We talked a little of incomprehensible West German timidity over thought of any dealings with East Germans and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> remarked that such dealings bound to come and would be better started under <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> if he could be persuaded than by his successor.</p>
<p>I told <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> in extreme confidence that President was giving some thought to possibility of a message to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to be despatched in next few days. This seemed to appeal to him. I indicated that if this were the President’s decision I would be talking to him and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> about it.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s parting remark was that he rather imagined the final outcome of the process in which we are all now engaged would be a <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit to Washington.</p>

<item>Problems Relating to the Conference</item>
</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> opened the meeting by saying that he had not heard a word from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> over the weekend. US reaction to the Soviet proposals had been unfavorable and even indignant. It now seemed impossible to go back to the discussions before the presentation of the latest Soviet plan.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> mentioned that the French had had a Cabinet meeting on Saturday and had agreed the <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> plan was unacceptable. He also saw difficulty in going back to the discussions since there did not seem to be much to talk about. The best thing now would be to break off for a recess. (However, it might put us in an unfavorable position to take the initiative on this and we should try to put the burden on the Soviets.)</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said the British agreed that the Soviet plan was not a basis for discussion. The question was how to deal with the present situation. There should be one more effort to get some agreement at the conference on Berlin. In any event, there were two things that had to be worked out. One was to formulate our proposals on Berlin in a new document which would have public appeal and represent our actual negotiating position. The Berlin proposals in the Western Peace Plan had <pb xml:id="pg_898" n="898" facs="0923"/>admittedly been an opening tactical position. The second thing was to decide on our position concerning a summit meeting. The British were concerned that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might take the initiative himself and invite heads of government to such a meeting on the grounds that the Foreign Ministers could do nothing. The British position on this would be to give an affirmative answer. They did not want a rift with their Allies but they were not prepared to lead their, people into a dangerous situation without one last effort toward settlement. Under these circumstances, they would prefer the initiative for a summit meeting to come from the Western Powers. They did not agree with the appraisal that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> no longer wanted a summit meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said any discussion of the summit here would revolve around time, place, and agenda. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had made the U.S. position on a summit meeting clear and there had been nothing here to justify holding one. We would not go to a Summit unless the threat of pressure on Berlin were removed. If the Foreign Ministers could not work out anything in all this time here, how could the heads of government succeed?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said the problem of a summit meeting would be discussed here whether or not we all wanted such discussion. If the question is raised by the Soviets, we should ask for 48 hours recess to make our replies.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said he wouldn’t bargain about a summit meeting. Perhaps he would not talk about it.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> thought it might ease the situation if the Western Powers took the initiative on a recess. We could then ask the Soviets what basis they thought there was for a summit meeting.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> remarked that if no summit were agreed on, there would be no pressures on the Russians but there would be every sort of world pressure on us. The Russians would seem to be cooperative while we were negative.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had created the present crisis. We had gone some distance in an effort to reduce tension. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> wanted to get rid of the tension by demanding further things from us. Public opinion had not been fooled and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had miscalculated.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he believed that the two sides had substantially narrowed their differences here at the conference. He believed that we had the makings of an agreement. The Soviets apparently would not object to our own reassertion of our rights, even though they did not subscribe to them nor accept them. The question was whether they would be expressed or not, in any agreement. There was agreement between the two sides, more or less, on troops, atomic weapons, espionage and propaganda activities in Berlin, a declaration by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and a commission <pb xml:id="pg_899" n="899" facs="0924"/>procedure for dealing with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. The heads of government could come to agreement along the lines laid out there. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could not go away from a summit meeting without some agreement.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he doubted we were near agreement. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said that we had only changed a few words and commas in our position.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> repeated he thought we had the makings of a bargain. There was agreement on the need for a temporary arrangement on Berlin to last until reunification. The Summit could start where we left off.</p>
<p>(<persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s remarks at this point were not audible to the reporter.)</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said when President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had indicated he would not go to a summit meeting without a Berlin settlement, this constituted some pressure.</p>
<p>When <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> sees within what limits we will make agreement and until he is confronted by our position, he won’t believe that we cannot be squeezed. (This remark by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> is as recorded by the reporting officer.)</p>
<p>(<persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s remarks at this point were also inaudible to the reporter.)</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said we seem to be back at the beginning.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said a new formulation would be a question of drafting. We might be willing to discuss with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> our formulation but the time limit and changes as proposed are completely unacceptable.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> wondered what we would talk about if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did in fact agree to go back to the earlier two papers.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> thought we could not just simply ask the Soviets to forget their new proposals, we would have to make a positive offer.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> remarked that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made the point in his private talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> last week<note n="1" xml:id="d393fn1">See <ref target="#d384">Document 384</ref>.</note> that we could not expect him to change his proposals, although he did endeavor to minimize the threat associated with them.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> suggested that the Western Powers might propose a recess under the circumstances.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> thought that we should recess for 48 hours to develop our final presentation to be made at a Plenary Session on Wednesday. If the Soviet reactions then were negative, there would be no point in going on. The other Ministers agreed.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> suggested that the new presentation of our Berlin proposals be accompanied by a statement expressing our regret that the Soviet Union had not been prepared to contribute toward the success of the conference nor had been willing to make any concessions. We <pb xml:id="pg_900" n="900" facs="0925"/>should say that, consequently, the Western Foreign Ministers had thought it better to recess the meeting. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> then suggested that the question of a summit meeting be referred to a resumed Foreign Ministers Meeting following the recess. He thought it would be extremely dangerous to move on to a summit meeting from the present position which could be construed as being based on the latest Russian proposals. The Russians would be able to develop their proposals in world public opinion and generate pressures from all sides. If we reacted to pressure to go to a summit meeting, this would tempt the Russians to increase pressures upon us at the summit meeting itself. There would always be part of the world press and public opinion for the meeting and for some agreement regardless of what it might be. The recess could be used to see how it would be possible to come to a summit meeting.</p>
<p>The Ministers then talked about tactics for the meeting with the Russians later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>It was agreed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> would open the discussion on the basis of the second half of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s speech at the Plenary Session,<note n="2" xml:id="d393fn2">See <ref target="#d385">Document 385</ref>.</note> calling for a return to the type of discussions going on before the latest Soviet proposals.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> commented that we should not expect any new proposals from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. At dinner Friday night <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had been quite tough and a hot discussion had ensued, during which, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said, he had traded blow for blow with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d393fn3"><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> briefed <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> on <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>’s dinner with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at 1 p.m. on June 13. The German Ambassador reported that nothing had emerged from the dinner that might indicate Soviet intentions or suggest a way out of the impasse in the conference. (Memorandum of conversation, US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/99; Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1340)</note> He and his colleagues at the dinner all agreed that the Soviets were in a rigid posture and were not prepared to make any concessions.</p>

<pb xml:id="pg_902" n="902" facs="0927"/>
<p>“June 15, 1959</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Chairman: The point seems to have been reached in the discussions among the four Foreign Ministers in Geneva at which I feel impelled to address to you this personal and private note. I shall give it no publicity whatsoever unless you should desire otherwise.</p>
<p>It has been my sincere hope that the progress at the Foreign Ministers meeting would be such as to justify a summit meeting at which final settlements of some of our problems could be reached. This note is a personal effort to explain to you why I feel that recent developments at Geneva imperil the achievement of this objective.</p>
<p>The Soviet Delegation, while unwilling to discuss in a serious way the broad peace plan which we put forward, has now, after some weeks of both private and plenary sessions, put forward proposals with respect to Berlin which are from our viewpoint a clearly unacceptable challenge to our position in that city. At the same time Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has stated that ‘in the opinion of the Soviet Government there is no foundation for any link between the results of this conference and the convening of a summit meeting.’ Because of your original acceptance on March 30 of my March 26 proposal<note n="1" xml:id="d395fn1">See <ref target="#d244">Document 244</ref>.</note> with respect to the current negotiations between us, I had come to believe that we were coming closer together in this important matter. You will probably recall that in part of my March 26 proposal I said, ‘The purpose of the Foreign Ministers Meeting should be to reach positive agreements over as wide a field as possible and in any case to narrow the differences between the respective points of view and to prepare constructive proposals for consideration by a conference of Heads of Government later in the summer. On this understanding and as soon as developments in the Foreign Ministers Meeting justify holding a summit conference, the US Government would be ready to participate in such a conference. The date, place, and agenda for such a conference would be proposed by the meeting of Foreign Ministers.’</p>
<p>You in your March 30 reply then stated: ‘The Soviet Government expresses the hope that all participants of the conference of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs will make their positive contribution to the work of this conference and that it will be an important step in the cause of creating a firm peace in Europe. The Soviet Government, on its part, will do everything possible to assist in the attainment of this goal.’</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that both you and I continue to hold to the spirit of this understanding and will do what we can in assuring that the Foreign Ministers’ talks will produce satisfactory results.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_903" n="903" facs="0928"/>
<p>It seems to me, unfortunately, that the latest Soviet position at Geneva as presented by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> creates an impossible situation for the United States in that it implies the convocation of a Summit Meeting without prior progress of any kind.</p>
<p>I am quite prepared to recognize that final agreements on the critical questions affecting world peace could probably be best concluded at a meeting of the Heads of Government. However, I want to say very earnestly that our Secretary of State has gone to Geneva with full authority from me and from the US Government to engage in serious negotiations of the type contemplated in the exchange of communications between us which led to the holding of the Foreign Ministers conference. I have no way of knowing, of course, Mr. Chairman, to what extent your own Foreign Minister is empowered by you to negotiate with this same degree of flexibility within the framework of what I thought was a firm understanding between you and me. But I do assure you that our purpose in the Foreign Ministers meeting has been to clear the way for a fruitful or at least hopeful meeting of Heads of Government.</p>
<p>I hope you will urgently consider the situation as it now stands. I write to you in no sense of attempting to bargain or to establish conditions. It is my thought only to see whether we will be able to achieve some greater measure of understanding between ourselves and eventually to reach settlements in some of the issues that divide us. Only thus, I think, can we bring about a real relaxation of the present tensions in the world. It would give me great satisfaction if we could meet later this year for that purpose.</p>
<p>I add only that if such a meeting were to offer hope of success it would certainly have to take place in an atmosphere in which neither side was posing a threat to the other and on the basis of such preparatory work by our Foreign Ministers as could give us reason to believe that the Heads of Government would be able to reach agreement on significant subjects. Anything less, it seems to me, would be a betrayal of the hopes of men everywhere.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1332)</note> This morning <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked to see me privately and by arrangement came to my villa at three p.m. He was accompanied only by <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> and interpreter. I had with me <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> and interpreter. He opened by asking my view as to where conference now stood. I told him that we had been literally shocked by his proposal of last Tuesday. I told him that we had asked for today’s recess in the knowledge that the President was sending a personal letter to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> which I then read to him.<note n="2" xml:id="d397fn2">See <ref target="#d395">Document 395</ref>.</note> I concluded that I was gloomy as to the prospects for the conference. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thanked me for the courtesy of informing him concerning the President’s message but said he would not comment on it since his Prime Minister would make an appropriate reply.</p>
<p>We then went back and forth over the old harrowed field of past discussions on Berlin. If anything he made even more clear than on any past occasion Soviet intention to get us out of Berlin. I told him that more than two million West Berliners counted on us for their safety and future and that we would not abandon our protective role. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stressed his disappointment over our negative reaction to his all-German committee proposal which he asserted had been largely borrowed from our plan and which he alleged was blocked by Federal Republic intransigeance. Incidentally he made plain that in Soviet view German reunification was so distant in future that tying interim Berlin solution to reunification was tantamount to perpetuating occupation regime indefinitely.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then brought up certain other subjects, namely, a denuclearized zone in Europe, the nuclear test talks, global disarmament and a nonaggression pact or declaration. He said that all of these had been mentioned at one time or another and said that Soviets were ready to exchange views if we were interested. I told him I thought we might exchange views on possible procedural steps to restart disarmament talks. A security zone in Europe, however, I said was inextricably tied to reunification and hence did not seem to me subject to discussion in light of Soviet rejection of any progress toward reunification. Nuclear test talks, I said, while going slowly were under negotiation in another <pb xml:id="pg_906" n="906" facs="0931"/>forum and to my mind not suitable for injection into Foreign Ministers conference. On non-aggression declaration I said I did not object in principle but that it seemed to me counter productive since it would duplicate provisions in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter to which we had both solemnly subscribed. I asked if his real purpose was to achieve a sort of recognition for the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> by having it co-signatory to any <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact non-aggression treaty. He said if this were only obstacle way might be found around it.</p>
<p>I concluded by suggesting that we be practical in assessing where we were and expressed hope <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would make prompt reply to President’s message. I told him that by early tomorrow we hoped to give him a draft of what we considered a fair interim solution for West Berlin (contained in following telegram).<note n="3" xml:id="d397fn3"><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 121, June 16. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/6–1659)</note> If this was unacceptable to him (as the present conversation seemed to indicate it would be) and in light of the Soviet obvious desire to force us to give up our rights, then I thought that it was impossible to reach any agreement, in which case my personal view, I said, was that we should set a future date to meet again. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that he would see what we produced in the way of a new draft but added that to date he was very pessimistic.</p>
<p>Throughout conversation <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was friendly in manner and temperate in expression. It was apparent, however, that he was strictly on fishing expedition and if he has instructions giving him any leeway there was no evidence whatsoever to this effect.</p>

<p>Dear Friend: <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> has told me of your message to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d398fn1">See <ref target="#d395">Document 395</ref>.</note> I hope that it will be salutory and that the Foreign Ministers may be able to bring their meeting to a close with agreement on a Summit Meeting.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_907" n="907" facs="0932"/>
<p>This, however, is the favourable view, and the discussions so far give small grounds for optimism. It is at least as likely that we shall find, after the next few days, that the Foreign Ministers can make no further progress on Berlin and are reaching a deadlock. What will happen then? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may at once make a public declaration that, as the Foreign Ministers have failed to reach any agreement, the Summit Meeting should be held without delay. Indeed, it is likely that he will publicly propose a date and place for such a meeting. We shall then find that we are, in effect, summoned publicly to a Summit by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>—in circumstances in which we shall find it equally difficult to justify to public opinion either an acceptance or a refusal. This will present us with a very embarrassing dilemma.</p>
<p>We must, I think, avoid that situation. We could do so if we forestalled Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> by ourselves proposing that the Heads of the four Governments should meet to consider the situation arising from the deadlock in the Foreign Ministers’ meeting. What I have in mind is, not that we should have the formal Summit Meeting which has been envisaged, with a throng of official advisers, and assessors from the two Germanies, and arguments about the Poles, the Czechs and the Italians, or even with an elaborate agenda; but that the Heads of the four Governments should meet informally (with their Foreign Ministers and a minimum of advisers) to talk over the situation and try to find a way through the difficulties. If we want an agreement—and surely we do—this, I am convinced, is the way to do business with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministers cannot go on much longer at Geneva; and, if in the next few days deadlock on Berlin appears to be inevitable, I believe that the wisest course would be to suggest as a next step a meeting of the kind indicated above. If you were prepared to suggest this yourself, and to invite the other three to come to meet you in the United States, this would make a great impact and I am sure that your initiative would be widely welcomed and regarded as eminently justified. But, if for any reason you do not wish to take this initiative yourself at this stage, I would be willing to make the first move and to suggest a meeting in London—or, if there were a general preference for meeting on neutral ground, at Geneva or at any other suitable place.</p>
<p>We must be prepared for the possibility of a breakdown at Geneva; and I feel most strongly that, if this happens, we must be ready to make a fresh move and to do so without any delay. We have managed to maintain our public position so far but if after a breakdown we allow the initiative to pass to the other side our public position may rapidly deteriorate. Certainly in this country—and I believe in the free world generally—public opinion will expect the Western leaders to do something. It seems to me that an initiative either by you or by me is the least that we could do.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_908" n="908" facs="0933"/>
<p>I feel that this may be an important turning-point in this long struggle, and I want to be sure that the free world by its clear demonstration of nobility and idealism is recognized as acting rightly, thus bringing the greatest influence on the uncommitted nations and on moderate opinion generally.</p>
<p>All except the first paragraph of this message was drafted before I knew of your message to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. No doubt your answer will depend upon the answer you get from him but I thought it right to let you have my thoughts.

<p>10996. Please deliver following message from President to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> immediately. Advise time delivery.</p>
<p>“June 16</p>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName>:</p>
<p>I shall probably want to write you further as soon as we know <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s reaction to my letter of June 15.<note n="1" xml:id="d399fn1">See <ref target="#d395">Document 395</ref>.</note> As you probably know, it was a most urgent suggestion to him to reconsider the Soviet position at Geneva, which has in fact retrogressed in recent days, and to live up to <pb xml:id="pg_909" n="909" facs="0934"/>his own pledge to us last March that the Soviet Government would do everything possible to make a positive contribution to the work of the Foreign Ministers Conference. As to his reaction to my message I am not particularly sanguine but I also do not believe that we have yet necessarily reached an impasse.</p>
<p>As respects the question of a Summit meeting, I reiterated to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> the formula that we agreed to at Camp David last spring and made it clear that such a meeting ‘would certainly have to take place in an atmosphere in which neither side was posing a threat to the other, and on the basis of such preparatory work by our Foreign Ministers as could give us reason to believe that the Heads of Government would be able to reach agreement on significant subjects.’</p>
<p>From this statement I could not and, in my opinion, should not retreat. One reason for this conviction is that if I should agree, in the absence of the stated prerequisites, to go to a Summit meeting, such a reversal on my part at this time would seriously impair any influence that I might hope to exercise with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Moreover it would be interpreted here as a dangerous exhibition of weakness, as indeed I would interpret it myself.</p>
<p>Frankly, it seems to me that any encounter of the three Western Heads of Government with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would, in fact, be a Summit meeting. I think the public would see no difference between an informal and a more formal gathering and I can’t see what advantage there would be in the ‘informal’ formula for us. As you say, we would certainly want our Foreign Ministers. They would want at least a few selected advisers. Adding the clerical housekeeping and security personnel, we would willy-nilly have a full-fledged Summit conference on our hands with world attention focused on it. The presence of a thousand representatives of the press would be the frosting on the cake.</p>
<p>I fully agree that public opinion is a factor of greatest importance and realize that you have some particular difficulties in this respect.</p>
<p>However, I do believe that should <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> face us with a call of a Summit meeting, we are not necessarily limited to a yes or no answer. I think, for example, that we would be in good posture to demand that the Foreign Ministers Conference be resumed after a few weeks recess. Possibly in some way or another we might find an opportunity to impress upon him personally the seriousness with which we regard any failure to bring about a resumption of that conference. For instance, if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should decide to replace Koslov in visiting the Soviet Exhibit in New York later this month, I would be ready, assuming no objection on the part of our allies, to meet with him in an effort to get the Foreign Ministers Meeting back on the tracks. While such an occurrence would seem most unlikely, yet it is the kind of thing that could be done without presenting <pb xml:id="pg_910" n="910" facs="0935"/>the picture of a ‘summit’ meeting. It would indeed represent only a fortuitous circumstance of which advantage could be taken.</p>
<p>The essential element is of course the continued unity of the West. Above all this applies with special force to our two governments. I am therefore letting <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Chris Herter</persName> know that I believe the Western Foreign Ministers should take no initiative to break up the conference finally but, if necessary, should seek a recess of a few weeks during which we could develop an agreed allied position as to our next moves. I hope you might make similar suggestions to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>.</p>
<p>As I said in the beginning of this letter, I shall want to write you further as soon as we hear from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Meanwhile, I should be glad to have your reactions to the foregoing.<note n="2" xml:id="d399fn2">On June 17 <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> replied that he agreed if no progress were made the best solution would be to have a short adjournment of the conference until about mid-July.

<p><gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 114. For Secretary from Acting Secretary. Last night after discussing details of letter to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d400fn1">See <ref target="#d395">Document 395</ref>.</note> the President indicated that in view of the real possibility of an early impasse on Berlin we should consider necessary action to ensure complete solidarity of Western powers at the highest level. I inquired from him what he would think of the possibility of a Western Summit meeting with himself, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de <pb xml:id="pg_911" n="911" facs="0936"/>Gaulle</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> which would have as its objective the clearing away of the underbrush of minor disagreements among the Western powers and the establishment of firm agreement on basic policy versus the Soviet Union. He wondered whether you would consider that such a meeting might be helpful from a public relations point of view and as a means of impressing the Soviets with the reality of Western unity of purpose.</p>
<p>I suggested that if such a meeting were held in London it might be of some help to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in the event a Summit Meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not come off; I also suggested it would give a useful opportunity for the President to have a bilateral talk with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. The President readily agreed and said he would be glad to go to London if it should be decided to have such a meeting and would then be willing to fly to Paris for a short visit with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your views on this in case the matter should come up again prior to your return. In view of the tentative nature of the thought the President wants it held very closely, with no mention of it to the British, French or Germans at this time, or indeed to any except your most senior advisers.<note n="2" xml:id="d400fn2">In <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 123 from Geneva, June 17, <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> replied that a Western summit might indicate that the solid front achieved at Geneva was not as solid as it seemed although an early meeting between the President and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> was most desirable.

I have just returned from a very brief private Foreign Ministers’ Conference at which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was asked to comment on our paper given him last night.<note n="1" xml:id="d401fn1">The meeting took place at 3:30 p.m. A detailed four-page memorandum of the conversation at the meeting, US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/109, is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1340.

His preliminary remarks covered only two points: 1) That there seemed little new in our proposals and that we and the Soviets had had different approaches to the Berlin problem; 2) That in his view symbolic troops in Berlin would be in the number of 3,500 to 4,000. I suggested we meet tomorrow morning but he asked for the afternoon.</p>
<p>Just prior to the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> had been optimistic in talking to the press as to possibilities of agreement based on our proposals.

<p>6595.I called on Prime Minister this morning at my request to discuss generally his current assessment developments Geneva and his thinking re future prospects.</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> anticipates <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will show his hand within next few days, particularly in view President’s letter.<note n="1" xml:id="d402fn1">See <ref target="#d395">Document 395</ref>.</note> He had not seen letter, but <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> had described it as “hortatory”. I would say he was glad of letter <pb xml:id="pg_913" n="913" facs="0938"/>since it helped West keep initiative which he greatly fears losing to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He believes the President to be the one who can, and really the only one who can give the lead. “I am not in least anxious to lead myself for my own ends,” he added, “and I’m sure the President knows this.”</p>
<p>Re further steps to maintain initiative, <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> said one way would be for President to see <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> alone, but <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> regards that as dangerous for reasons he did not specify. He considered meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, and himself in Washington would be useful, and would anticipate such meeting with pleasure. He toyed with idea that perhaps the Queen might summon him to Canada when the President was there, but did not pursue the matter further.</p>
<p>If <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s propose postponement Geneva meeting for week or ten days, <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> would regard development as good sign. On contrary, if they propose adjournment of say four months, such proposal would be bad in that, in <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s view, during those four months (1) West would be torn by barrage of nagging public criticism and public tirades against H-bombs, etc., and (2) it would be <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>’s guess that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would make peace treaty.</p>
<p>Finally in summarizing his thoughts on current prospects for West, Prime Minister said he pins his hopes on possibility that we can persuade <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to agree to a provisional settlement of the Berlin situation for say three years, in which the juridical argument would be shelved by formula perhaps involving agreement to disagree on “rights”. If so, he still has some hope that progress can be made in other areas through a more general discussion at a summit meeting.</p>

<p>2570. Observe Presidential Handling. Geneva for Secretary. Kornienko, Acting Chief American Section MFA, summoned me at 1700 today and handed me <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s reply dated June 17 to President’s letter of June 15. The following is text:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_914" n="914" facs="0939"/>
<p>“Dear Mr. President: I received your kind message and highly esteem your concern to find a path for the liquidation of the tense situation between States and to introduce calmness into the world.</p>
<p>The Soviet Government on its part has never spared efforts in order to attain this goal and to create a situation of confidence and mutual understanding between States. When we received your message in February<note n="1" xml:id="d403fn1">See <ref target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note> which touched on the question of convoking a conference of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, we, as you remember, immediately gave a response<note n="2" xml:id="d403fn2">See <ref target="#d194">Document 194</ref>.</note> and set forth our conceptions concerning what the Foreign Ministers should concern themselves with and what might be expected from this conference. In our messages agreement was expressed that the Ministers of Foreign Affairs should consider the problems which await decision. At the same time we emphasized that the current international situation is very complicated and has so many difficult problems that a decision on all questions appears beyond the powers of the Ministers and such a nut can be too hard for them. Therefore we did not hide our opinion that for the solution of ripe international problems, such forces should be included which have greater plenary powers and rights, that is, the Heads of Governments and of states.</p>
<p>I should like to remark that the question of a meeting of the Heads of Governments was also touched upon during the talks in Moscow with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">H. Macmillan</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">H. Macmillan</persName> expressed then the just opinion that one meeting of the Heads of Governments may prove to be insufficient, that the Heads of Governments will not decide immediately all problems in view of which a first meeting may mark only a beginning and several meetings of the Heads of Governments will be required for the achievement of the necessary success.</p>
<p>It is impossible not to take into account that the peoples expect from the leading state figures that there should be taken without delay measures for the lessening of international tension and the strengthening of peace, and governments are obliged to reckon with this.</p>
<p>Having agreed with the proposal for the convocation of a conference of the Foreign Ministers, the Soviet Government, of course, hoped that this Conference will bring its useful contribution to the matter of the preparation of mutually acceptable, positive agreements. Sending its Minister of Foreign Affairs to Geneva, it empowered him to take all possible measures for obtaining the success of the Conference. It seems to us that despite the divergencies and difficulties which have appeared in Geneva, that work, which has already been done by the Ministers, has a <pb xml:id="pg_915" n="915" facs="0940"/>certain positive significance. The conference has permitted positions of the sides on a number of questions to be better clarified, to define the degree of the existing disagreements and to try in some measure to draw nearer the viewpoint of the sides on separate aspects of actual international problems.</p>
<p>The situation which has developed at the Geneva Conference of Ministers has impelled the Soviet Government to introduce recently new proposals taking into account the position of the Western powers and the real situation. At the same time we were anxious that the Conference of the Ministers would be as productive as possible and that it would take some step forward in the direction of the solution of such of the most acute contemporary questions as a peaceful settlement with Germany, the normalization of the situation in West Berlin, the rapprochement of the two German Governments with the aim of the achievement of the reestablishment of German unity. Of course, all this would clear the way and would create more favorable conditions also for the solution of other ripe international problems.</p>
<p>We consider that the Soviet proposals which were introduced in Geneva provide a good basis for agreement of the sides because they take into consideration the position of the Western powers and proceed from the necessity to concentrate attention on what can reasonably be decided already now. We consider that once an agreement in principle exists between our governments in relation to the necessity for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and a solution of the question of West Berlin, then the way can and must be found to work out a concrete formula of agreement on each of these questions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the US Secretary of State, supported by the Ministers of England and France, refused to discuss the substance of the proposals which give a basis for the gradual liquidation of the abnormal situation in West Berlin and Germany, and for the sides coming to an understanding without harm to anyone’s interests or prestige. At the same time they persistently seek to foist on the Soviet Union an agreement by which the preservation of the occupation regime in West Berlin would be confirmed for an indefinite time and which would also put off further the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.</p>
<p>As the main argument against the Soviet proposals, the US Secretary of State advances the question about the period of operation of a temporary agreement on West Berlin and about the all-German committee. I should like to think that such an evaluation of the Soviet proposals is based on a misunderstanding or incorrect understanding.</p>
<p>What is the essence of our proposals? Since the Western powers at present are not ready to come to an immediate and complete abolition of the occupation regime in West Berlin, the Soviet Government gave instructions to its Minister not to oppose the preservation in the course of a <pb xml:id="pg_916" n="916" facs="0941"/>definite period of the occupation rights of the three powers in West Berlin. We proposed to work out an agreement on a temporary settlement of the question of West Berlin which would operate in the course of this period. During that time the all-German committee should work out concrete measures for the preparation and conclusion of a German Peace Treaty and the unification of Germany. Thus the essence of the proposals of the Soviet Government consists in gradually liquidating the abnormal situation in West Berlin and in preparing a peace treaty and measures for the unification of Germany.</p>
<p>The question about the period for us is neither the main one nor one of principle. It surprises us that this question is represented now as the main obstacle to the attainment of agreement. Indeed also in the socalled “comprehensive plan” of the Western powers it was proposed for example to limit the work of the all-German committee by a definite period; however, we did not consider such a proposal about a period as an ultimatum. Naming a period from our side, we proceed from the fact that it is impossible endlessly to drag out a peaceful settlement with Germany and to preserve the occupation regime in West Berlin. It is impossible to permit such a situation so that the world would find itself in a state of tension because of the uncompromising position taken, let us say by the Government of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. Can one fail to take into account such statements of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> in which he openly declared that if any kind of organ for consideration of German questions will be created, then it will be possible to carry on negotiations in it for many years. In this time under the cover of such an organ the policy of militarization of West Germany and the policy of preparation of war would be continued.</p>
<p>The establishment of a definite period will serve only peaceful purposes, will answer the vital interests of the peoples. If the one-year period named by the Soviet Union does not suit the Western powers, then it is possible to agree on another period, acceptable for all interested sides. Both sides have named periods; now it is necessary to seek to find something in the middle (chto-to sredneye) and to reach an agreed decision. We are sure that if we will have agreement on the main, fundamental questions, then no difficulties will be met in agreement on the necessary periods.</p>
<p>I agree with you, Mr. President, that the situation in the Geneva Conference is now such that it demands of all its participants efforts in the direction of drawing together the points of view. The Soviet Government has given the necessary instructions to its Minister and we expect that similar steps will be undertaken also by the governments of the Western powers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the Ministers also do not succeed in reaching the necessary understanding, then in our opinion a Summit meeting <pb xml:id="pg_917" n="917" facs="0942"/>will become even more urgently necessary. We cannot, taking into account our responsibility before the peoples, fail to use all means for attainment of an easing of tension and strengthening of peace.</p>
<p>I would like to say that I consider this exchange of personal letters on an unofficial basis useful and we agree with you that these should not be given publicity.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 130. This morning before meeting of four Western Foreign Ministers, <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> called on me at his request. Purpose proved to be to express his deep concern over trend conference in past few days.

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 131. I met with Western Foreign Ministers at noon today. As usual <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had with him <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LJ1">Laloy</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> had <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGF1">Duckwitz</persName> plus interpreter; <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had Rumbold, <persName corresp="#p_HPF1">Hancock</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LDS1">Laskey</persName>; and I had with me <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>.</p>
<p>I opened by reading <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s reply<note n="1" xml:id="d405fn1">See <ref target="#d403">Document 403</ref>.</note> to the President. All agreed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s position as already exposed would now be frozen since <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not advance a single thought not already incorporated in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s proposals.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked what our position should be if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> were to accept our agreement<note n="2" xml:id="d405fn2">Regarding the Western proposal of June 16, see <ref target="#d396fn1">footnote 1, Document 396</ref>.</note> in toto except for duration provision which he would then offer to set at two years with understanding four powers would examine position at expiration that period. No one present felt it likely that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would accept all other paragraphs. I pointed out that as now drawn the paper constituted minimum position from which we could not afford to be whittled.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then asked if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> proved negative at private meeting this afternoon should we not suggest an immediate recess for a month. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> emphatically agreed as did I. It was further agreed that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> would broach this to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at lunch he is giving him today placing suggestion on legitimate grounds <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s engagements.</p>
<p>Assuming <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> accepts recess after consulting Moscow, we were agreed [it] desirable to avoid final plenary but would accept if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked for it. In any event the text of the Western proposal would be given out publicly before recessing. We will meet again following private session at <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s villa this afternoon.</p>
<p>Since dictating above I have received word from <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked for postponement today’s private meeting until tomorrow afternoon. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> was unsuccessful in advancing meeting until morning. Subject of recess was not broached at lunch.</p>

I am listing below series of questions which we think might be put to him, in private meeting such as suggested <gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 124,<note n="3" xml:id="d406fn3"><gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 124, June 17, reported that the President was impressed with the conciliatory tone of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s message and suggested that <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> meet privately with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to see if he had received new instructions. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note> and you will think of many others. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s postponement of session today also leads us to think he might be expecting new instructions conceivably going beyond blandly unyielding position of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s letter.</p>
<p>We would not expect this exercise to go on for any length of time though we could envisage it might extend into next week. If <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> has to be absent wouldn’t it be possible for him to leave a deputy behind if this proved necessary?</p>
<p>Following are suggested questions:</p>
<p>1. How can <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s statement that a Summit meeting becomes more necessary if the Foreign Ministers do not reach meaningful understanding square with the understanding concerning the terms of reference of the Foreign Ministers conference reached in the exchange of letters dated March 26 and March 30?<note n="4" xml:id="d406fn4">See <ref target="#d244">Document 244</ref>.</note></p>
<p>2. What does <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> mean when he stated that the “main obstacle to attainment of agreement” is merely a question of the time period? <pb xml:id="pg_920" n="920" facs="0945"/>Has he not been informed that the question of recognition of Western rights to be in Berlin pending German reunification is the central point of contention?</p>
<p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> states that it is “possible to agree on another period” than one year. Does this mean that the Soviets are prepared to recognize Western rights in Berlin for the period prior to German reunification? Why should any period be fixed in terms of time when clearly should be in terms of goal on which we all agree?</p>
<p>4. What is the “certain positive significance” in the work of the Foreign Ministers which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> sees?</p>
<p>5. The letter equates the time period in the Western Peace Plan with the Soviet ultimatum for the surrender of Western rights in Berlin in the course of one year: has the Soviet Prime Minister not been informed that, unlike the Soviet proposal, the Western plan would involve no unilateral action against Soviet rights as in case Soviet proposals?</p>
<p>6. The letter states that the Soviet proposal would entail no “harm to anyone’s interests.” Is it the Soviet position that the surrender of Western rights in Berlin would not damage Western interests? Or the security and well-being of the West Berliners?</p>
<p>7. If, as the letter states, the question of the duration of Western rights in Berlin is “neither the main one nor one of principle” can the Soviet Union not agree to the maintenance of those rights until German reunification?</p>
<p>8. What does <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> mean by stating that the Soviet proposal would “concentrate attention on what can reasonably be decided now”?</p>
<p>9. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> states that the Soviet Government has instructed the Foreign Minister to bend his “efforts in direction of drawing together points of view.” Does this signify Soviet willingness to negotiate on Western proposals on Berlin or on Western “Peace Plan”?</p>
<p>10. Does not the four powers “responsibility before the peoples” to use all means for easing tensions obligate the USSR to negotiate seriously at the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting as well as at a summit meeting?</p>
<p>11. Does <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s statement that the solution of important international problems is “beyond the powers of the ministers” not contradict Soviet note of March 30 which said the four powers have “reached agreement to start solving urgent international questions at a Foreign Ministers conference and a summit meeting”?</p>
<p>12. What “measures for obtaining the success of the conference” does the Soviet Foreign Minister consider he has taken when the latest Soviet proposals only reiterate Soviet positions advanced and rejected as a basis for negotiation prior to the conference?</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_921" n="921" facs="0946"/>
<p>13. As the letter refers to better clarification of a number of questions, could the Soviet Foreign Minister clarify what worries the USSR in the existing situation in Berlin?</p>
<p>14. Does Soviet Government advance seriously proposals the “essence” of which consists in “gradually liquidating abnormal situation”, i.e., Western position in West Berlin?</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Revised Soviet Proposal, Western Reaction; Conference Recess</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> opened by remarking that in spite of the differences and difficulties, the work of the Ministers had had certain positive aspects. The exchange of views had allowed a clarification of the issues and made it possible to specify the degree of difference on the various points. It represented an effort to bring views closer together. The Soviet Delegation, taking account of the position of the Western Powers and of the actual situation, had submitted new proposals on June 9 and 10 on the burning questions—Berlin and an all-German committee. They <pb xml:id="pg_922" n="922" facs="0947"/>regretted that we had taken a negative stand on these proposals. They had taken into consideration bur main objection, which concerned the time limit relating to the Berlin question and to the all-German committee. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said we had based our objections on a misunderstanding of the essence of their proposals. Since the Western Powers were not at present ready to agree to the immediate and complete abolition of the occupation regime for West Berlin, the Soviet Government had expressed the position that it would not object to the continuation of certain rights in West Berlin for a certain time. The Soviets had proposed working out an agreement for a temporary arrangement on West Berlin to remain in force for a certain period while an all-German committee would work out specific concrete measures concerning the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and concerning reunification of Germany. Thus the essence of their proposals was to work toward gradually liquidating the abnormal situation in West Berlin, and to prepare a peace treaty, and to make arrangements for the reunification of Germany. His next remarks, in verbatim, were:</p>
<list>
<item>“On the basis of the exchange of views held at our Conference and taking into account the considerations put forward by the Western Powers, the Soviet Government believes that it is quite possible to find an acceptable basis for agreement on the Berlin question and on the question of an all-German committee.</item>
<item>“An agreement on an interim status of West Berlin should, in the opinion of the Soviet Government, include agreement on the following:</item>
<item>“Reduction of the occupation forces of the Western Powers in West Berlin to symbolic contingents;</item>
<item>“Termination of subversive activities from West Berlin against the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and other socialist states;</item>
<item>“Non-location in West Berlin of atomic and rocket weapons.</item>
<item>“These are the measures relating to West Berlin that we should agree upon in the first place.</item>
<item>“The question of a time-limit of that agreement is a matter neither of major importance, nor of principle to us. The Soviet Government is proceeding from the premise that it is impossible to delay a peace settlement with Germany and to preserve the occupation regime in West Berlin ad infinitum. If the time-limit indicated by the Soviet Government does not suit the Western Powers, then we can agree upon another time-limit acceptable to all sides concerned. In the course of the Conference the Western Powers have indicated a definite time-limit for the functioning of an all-German committee, namely, two and a half years. We have indicated a one year time-limit. Now we should try to find something of a medium nature and to reach an agreed decision. We believe that it would be possible to agree upon a one and [a] half year time limit. We are convinced that if agreement is achieved between us on main questions of principle no difficulties will arise in agreeing on necessary time-limits.</item>
<item>“During the period agreed upon between the parties to the agreement the two German states will carry out measures relating to the establishment and activities of an all-German committee composed of the <pb xml:id="pg_923" n="923" facs="0948"/>representatives of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> on a parity basis. The committee should promote extension and development of contacts between the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, discuss and work out concrete measures for the unification of Germany and consider questions pertaining to the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.</item>
<item>“If during the agreed period no solution of the questions of a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of Germany can be reached within the framework of an all-German committee or otherwise, then the participants of the Geneva Conference of Foreign Ministers of 1959 could resume the consideration of the West Berlin question.</item>
<item>“Should we have to renew the discussion of the West Berlin question after the expiration of the said time-limit, such discussion should undoubtedly be conducted with due regard of a situation obtained by that time.</item>
<item>“For the duration of the agreement the communications of West Berlin with the outside world will be preserved in their present shape.</item>
<item>“As it has already been pointed out in the proposals of the Soviet Government of June 9–10, a supervisory committee composed of the representatives of the United States, the USSR, Great Britain and France is proposed to be established to supervise the fulfillment of the obligations of the parties arising from the above-mentioned agreement on an interim status of West Berlin.</item>
<item>“The above proposals of the Soviet Government meet the views expressed by the Western Powers and constitute a good basis for mutually acceptable agreement on the Berlin question and on an all-German committee.”</item>
</list>
<p>[After setting forth the above, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that the Ministers had, of course, not narrowed differences all the way. There were still great differences on certain questions, particularly on the question of troops.]<note n="1" xml:id="d407fn1">Brackets in the source text.</note> (After the meeting the Soviets released the verbatim text of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks up to this point—with the exception of the bracketed sentence above. The press release did, however, contain the following paragraphs which were not expressed by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at this meeting:</p>
<list>
<item>“The Soviet delegation takes also cognizance of the fact that in the course of discussions at the Conference the position of the Western Powers and that of the Soviet Union were brought closer together on many questions touched upon in these proposals. This applies among other things, to the reduction of armed forces and non-location of atomic and rocket weapons in West Berlin, the termination of subversive activities, as well as to the necessity of setting up an all-German committee to facilitate a rapprochement of the two German states and to make easier their reunification and to the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany.</item>
<item>“The Soviet Government hopes that the Governments of the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss>, Britain and France will approach with due attention the said Soviet proposals and a mutually acceptable agreement will be reached.”)</item>
</list>
<pb xml:id="pg_924" n="924" facs="0949"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked if it were <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s intention to give us a piece of paper on the points he had just made. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then circulated a document containing the above proposals, in Russian and what he called unofficial English translation, and asked that it be considered only as a talking paper. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> asked whether it would be published and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that it would not be published today.</p>
<p>The Western Ministers then asked for a recess in the session.</p>
<p>The second afternoon session began at 5:15 p.m.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that, acting for the Four Western Foreign Ministers who were in complete agreement on the situation and had reduced their views to writing, he would read a statement. He then read the following statement which was translated into Russian by Martinov immediately thereafter.</p>
<p rend="center">WESTERN STATEMENT OF JUNE 19</p>
<list>
<item>“The Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom and the United States have examined the statement made to them this afternoon by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. This statement was clearly timed to coincide with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech today<note n="2" xml:id="d407fn2">For an extract from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s June 19 speech, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting,</hi> pp. 316–328 or <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985,</hi> pp. 667–670.</note> in which the Western proposals of June 16 were characterized as ‘groundless and unacceptable’. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement does not differ in any important aspects from the Soviet proposal of June 9 on which the Western Ministers clearly expressed their views in the meetings of June 10 and 12.</item>
<item>“Although the latest Soviet statement extends the time limit of the proposed agreement from one year to a year and a half, it reserves to the Soviet Union freedom of unilateral action at the expiration of that period. Moreover it is clear that it is the Soviet intention that the Western Powers upon signing such an agreement would acquiesce in the liquidation of their rights in Berlin and the abandonment of their responsibility for maintaining the freedom of the people of West Berlin.</item>
<item>“It is true that there is provision for a resumption of the consideration of the Berlin question by the Four Powers during or at the end of the year and a half period. But if no agreement has been reached in the meantime the Western Powers would enter into any negotiation at the end of that period without any rights at all so far as Berlin or the access to it were concerned.</item>
<item>“In the light of these fundamental objections the Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom and the United States have concluded that the latest Soviet statement constitutes no change in the previous Soviet position. They consider that in the circumstances the wise course is to recess the Conference for a period. They accordingly suggest that the next meeting be postponed until July 13, 1959. This interval would give the Soviet Government the opportunity of considering the Western proposals further. It would give the Western Governments the opportunity to consider the position in relation in particular to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_925" n="925" facs="0950"/>
<item>statement of today and its connection with the future course of negotiations.”</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> remarked that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> described the prolongation of the time limit as representing no change. The Soviet proposals had referred to a year and a half, but he recalled that he had told us they did not foresee any difficulties about the duration of the period. We had named one period of time. They had named another. The year and a half represented something in between. This was not the main question nor was it a question of principle, as far as they were concerned. As to the matter of unilateral action, the Western statement charged that the Soviets in their proposals reserved their freedom to take unilateral action, as purportedly was indicated in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s statements in the Soviet Union and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s here. As we knew well, their proposals provided that if the all-German committee reached no agreement within the period prescribed, a conference of the same participants as this present one would be convened to discuss the whole question again. This made the whole question a subject of negotiation and it was not understandable why the matter of unilateral action was raised now. We said that during the period concerned or at the expiration of the time limit or even when the period was entered into, we were without rights. We were free to draw such conclusions but they were not bound to agree to them. They had made no special statements with regard to rights. These were our statements. They had hoped for a favorable response on their proposals. He realized that our reaction was the result of a first acquaintance with these new proposals. He urged that we give them serious consideration. The Soviet Government had not submitted these proposals to complicate the question but in order to facilitate negotiation. As to a recess, they preferred to continue the present talks and reach a positive result at this meeting. If their partners did not want to continue, they could do nothing but take this into account.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks about our not having understood their proposals added to his conviction that a recess was desirable. The U.S. would give serious thought to the Russian proposals and we were ready to be persuaded that we were wrong. He suggested July 13 as the date for reconvening the Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> remarked that this date takes into account the fact that <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> could not be here any earlier.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the problems of all the Ministers should be taken into consideration. He would prefer a two weeks’ recess, for example.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_926" n="926" facs="0951"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said this would be difficult for him. He had already been here six times as long as he had been in the State Department himself since taking over as Secretary. A three weeks recess would be the shortest period he could contemplate.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> insisted that his problems should be taken into account as well as others.</p>
<p>Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said they had tried to shorten the time but <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had a serious problem.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would not consider a resumption beginning with the deputies. He asked <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> to share the inconvenience on an equal basis. He suggested July 9 or 10.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he could make it on the afternoon of the 13th at the earliest. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> accepted and they both thanked each other for their respective accommodating attitudes.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> suggested a Plenary Meeting to wind up this phase of the conference. The Four Ministers agreed to a Plenary Session tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. which would be purely a formality and at which no speeches would be made.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then produced a draft communiqué in Russian which read as follows:</p>
<list><item>“The exchange of views at the Geneva Conference of Foreign Ministers, which began its work on May 11, significantly facilitated a mutual clarification of the positions of the participants of the conference on the questions discussed, which makes easier their further examination. The Foreign Ministers of the USSR, U.S., U.K. and France agreed to take a recess in the work of the conference and to resume the conference on July 13, 1959.”</item></list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said he could subscribe to the second sentence in this draft. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said they thought the exchange of opinions had been useful, but if we did not, that was a different matter. We ought to agree anyway on something to say to the press today. The Ministers then agreed to say that two private meetings had been held today and the Ministers had agreed to hold a Plenary Session on June 20 at 11:00 a.m.</p>

<item>Discussion of June 19 Soviet Proposals and Western Statement</item>
</list>
<p>The Ministers discussed the proposals just presented by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at the private meeting at his Villa.<note n="1" xml:id="d408fn1">See <ref target="#d407">Document 407</ref>.</note> All agreed that they should be considered together with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech,<note n="2" xml:id="d408fn2">See <ref target="#d407fn2">footnote 2, Document 407</ref>.</note> the first part of which had just come over the ticker.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he thought it would not be wise to take definite action on the basis of a fragmentary report of the speech. He said also that the extension of the time limit on negotiations to a year and a half would be considered a Soviet concession by much of world opinion, and particularly the population in Britain.</p>
<p>The other Ministers all pointed out that the main element in these proposals remained the same as before, that our rights in West Berlin would be eliminated either at the end of the period or sometime during the period. It was a clever paper.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> agreed that it was time for a recess.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_928" n="928" facs="0953"/>
<p>A short discussion on the various unacceptable aspects ensued. This involved the all-German Committee (and on a parity basis); the discussion of a peace treaty by the Germans instead of by the Four Powers; the difference in status at the end of the time limit envisaged by each side; and the absence of reciprocity with regard to subversive activities in Berlin.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> thought we ought to point out that the Soviets had called our proposal absolutely groundless and unacceptable and throw this charge back at them with regard to theirs.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> suggested we propose signature of a peace treaty with West Germany as a counter to their call for a separate peace treaty for the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> remarked that this had already been done in a sense in the Paris agreement.</p>
<p>The Ministers decided to draft a statement which would give the Western attitude with regard to the Soviet proposals and include provision for a recess.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> submitted a draft which was discussed and revised by the Ministers. (The final text appears in the memorandum on the private meeting at <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s Villa.)</p>
<p>It was agreed that this paper would be read by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> on resumption of the afternoon session with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
<p>The Ministers then proceeded to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s Villa. They returned at 6:45 p.m. following this session.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested we should all say to our own peoples that we had said that we wanted negotiations with the Russians; that we had realized that negotiations with them were long and difficult; and that we were ready to go on to seek some agreement. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said nothing about a Summit Meeting. If questioned by the press, we ought to say that what has happened here neither makes a Summit Meeting harder nor easier.</p>
<p>The Ministers agreed that the Western paper just read to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d408fn3">See <ref target="#d407">Document 407</ref>.</note> should be released at 7:30 this evening whether or not the Soviet proposals had been made public by then.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested that when the deputies meet tomorrow to draft a joint communiqué with the Russians, we should avoid having just platitudes. There should be some statement about the Ministers regretting that agreement was not reached—since this would strike a responsive chord with public opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> that he would not be going to Berlin as he had considered doing. It was better not to do so, now that a recess had been agreed upon.</p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> invited the other Ministers to meet with him at lunch on July 13 preceding the scheduled afternoon meeting to reopen the conference.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of the other Ministers, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agreed to report on the conference to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> next Monday.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said he thought the Four Ministers should do something between now and July 13 in order to prepare for the resumed negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> thought the deputies might meet on Saturday, July 11. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that there would be much to do through diplomatic channels. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> thought a working group might be needed.

<p>I said I hope that during the period the conference was in recess nothing would be done to aggravate the situation.

<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> raised the question of where we stood on the conference. I told him that as long as a time limit was placed on us either with respect to occupation troops in Berlin or possible studies by some all-German committee, we could not reach agreement. However, I said I would be discussing in Washington the possibility of a time limit of at least 2-1/2 years (which would carry the period beyond the German domestic elections) provided it were coupled with a clear-cut statement that a Foreign Ministers conference scheduled at the end of that time could discuss further possible arrangements without prejudice to the presently existing and continuing rights. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> told me that he had talked to both <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> at lunch time and that they were in agreement that in place of an all-German Committee we could properly advance a Big Four Committee with German advisers, the Big Four Committee having authority to request or instruct the German advisers to study between themselves (a) the bettering of interchanges between the two Germanys, (b) principles of a peace treaty, and (c) the reunification of Germany, bringing their conclusions to the representatives of the Big Four, still as advisers. I said I would give that suggestion considerable thought as it coincided very closely with my own feeling that this would be a desirable provision from the Allied side.</p>

<p>I mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> that the British press had been saying a great deal about the possibility of a Western Summit meeting. I asked <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> whether he had discussed this matter with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and he said that he had not. He added, however, that he personally felt that it would be a great mistake to hold such a meeting before our coming talks in Geneva since it would be regarded by the world as a panicky reaction and a sign of weakness rather than strength. He then repeated his personal satisfaction that we had been able to maintain such an effective united front in Geneva.</p>

<p>We discussed the present status of contingency planning. I raised the question of the possible admissibility of German guards at check points in the light of the paper which we presented to the Russians.<note n="1" xml:id="d411fn1">For text of this June 16 paper, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting,</hi> pp. 312–313; <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 237–238; or <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1945,</hi> pp. 665–666.</note> We both agreed this should be restudied for contingency planning purposes since it would be much simpler to insist on the continuance of present procedures with German guards than to make the issue one of the type of stamping now being done by Russian guards. With respect to probes, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> said that the British preferred <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s second alternative for the initial probe and that they were unwilling to make final commitments with respect to a military probe of reinforced battalion or divisional strength, feeling that the matter would undoubtedly be before the United Nations at that stage.

<p>2875. As Embassy has reported, the embittered relationship between Chancellor and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> reached new peak last week, when <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, during journalistic interviews, after terming his Vice Chancellor “Very talented man” proceeded to say he did not possess qualities and abilities requisite for Chancellorship.</p>
<p>Having already made <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> eat one dish of crow, he now seems ready to prescribe it as steady diet. Whether <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s relentless attacks are dictated by vindictiveness or by policy cannot be determined, but probably by both. Although accusation is made they result from senility, no one close to him has observed any changes in his customary mental acuteness or physical vigor. In fact, he seems, at least outwardly, to enjoy the fight he had precipitated.</p>
<p>But from standpoint parliamentarians and general public, his prestige has undoubtedly suffered greatly. Even if he can again bring <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> to heel, he will have suffered in common estimation, have afforded opportunity for denunciations his undemocratic methods, and have left permanent scars on his own party’s body.</p>
<p>Jealousy and dislike of <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>’s popularity, and his consequent capacity to take independent action, may well have influenced <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. However, I suspect a stronger factor is his belief <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> is not a good European in the Chancellor’s sense, and particularly might not carry on the Franco-German rapprochement policy so obsessively dear to the old man.</p>
<p>I have refrained from seeing Chancellor recently. I feel if I did so, regardless of substance of conversation, action would be widely and variously misinterpreted. In my opinion, U.S. officials should abstain from comment on this domestic affair, despite its foreign repercussions. It may become even more prickly. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> has compounded his original error over the presidential succession by other mistakes of judgment and in his present mood is likely to make additional ones. Critically compromised as he is, it must be remembered he is self-assured, more of a man than any of his adversaries, and will probably continue to dominate them but with diminished authority.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Secretary, The Foreign Secretary has asked me to send you the enclosed message,<note n="1" xml:id="d415fn1">Not printed. This brief note told <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> was asking <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> to explain to the Secretary of State his ideas on what should be done during the recess of the Geneva Conference.</note> with a copy of a separate message which the Prime Minister has addressed to the President.<note n="2" xml:id="d415fn2"><ref target="#d416">Document 416</ref>.</note></p>
<p>At the same time he has asked me to speak to you on the following lines. In doing so, he wishes me to stress that he is not trying to put his thoughts into a very concrete shape, but is sending them to you as quickly as possible, since there is not much time to lose. With that in mind, I am putting this oral message on paper to you, in the hope that you will see me as soon as you can to give me your comments.</p>
<p>When you parted in Geneva last Saturday you agreed that the fullest use would have to be made of the interval before July 13 in order to concert a Western position before the next round. In view of this he has been taking stock of the situation and reflecting in particular about the developments on the last Friday.</p>
<p>It seems to him that what happened was this. The Western side gave <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> a paper<note n="3" xml:id="d415fn3">Regarding the Western proposal of June 16, see <ref target="#d411fn1">footnote 1, Document 411</ref>.</note> which had the effect of preserving their own essential requirements while at the same time not explicitly requiring <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to put his signature to what he had declared to be fundamentally objectionable, i.e. the perpetuation of the occupation regime. On June 19 <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> performed the same manoeuvre in reverse. That is to say he gave you a document<note n="4" xml:id="d415fn4">For text of this paper, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting,</hi> pp. 329–331; <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 238–239; or <hi rend="italic">Documents on Germany, 1944–1985,</hi> p. 667. The verbatim remarks by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at the June 19 meeting (see <ref target="#d407">Document 407</ref>) are essentially the same as the paper cited here.</note> which secured what the Soviet Government has hitherto stated to be its essential requirement, i.e. the end of the occupation status, while not requiring us, at least outwardly, to subscribe to this. Just as there was a catch in the Western paper from his point of view, so there was in his paper from our point of view. The catch for him in our paper was that the arrangements which it described would unless modified by Four Power agreement continue in force until the reunification of Germany. This spelt for him “the perpetuation of the <pb xml:id="pg_936" n="936" facs="0961"/>occupation regime”. The catch in his paper from our point of view, particularly when it was read in conjunction with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech,<note n="5" xml:id="d415fn5">See <ref target="#d407fn2">footnote 2, Document 407</ref>.</note> was of course the reverse. There was the implication in the last sentence but two that at the end of the period of the provisional agreements, communications with Berlin would not necessarily continue “in their present shape”. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> rubbed in the element of the concealed ultimatum contained in this phrase when he said that if the All-German Committee failed to reach agreement, the Soviet Government would sign a separate peace treaty with the D.D.R., and that this would automatically end the foreign occupation rights in D.D.R. territory. There were of course many other divergencies between the two approaches, but this was in the view of the Foreign Secretary the principal one.</p>
<p>On Friday evening, however, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was off on a slightly different tack. He released a statement to the press<note n="6" xml:id="d415fn6">For text of this statement, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting,</hi> pp. 332–334 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd.</hi> 868, pp. 176–177.</note> saying by way of comment on the statement which you had made to him in the afternoon that if no agreement were reached within the All-German Committee during the specified time limit, the Soviet Government proposed that the four Foreign Ministers should resume their consideration of the West Berlin question and “make this question a subject of negotiations similar to those which we hold here now”. As the Foreign Secretary told you that Saturday afternoon, he had pressed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> earlier in the day to explain exactly what he had meant when he released this statement to the press. He asked him what would happen at the end of the period if there had been no agreement in the All-German Committee, and whether the status quo as regards access would continue after the end of the period. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he had not implied that there would be any unilateral action. The Soviet view was that if there was no agreement in the Committee, there should be a conference on the same basis as the present one. He confirmed that there would be no unilateral action during this conference. In short, what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seemed to be trying to do before the recess was to remove the flavour of ultimatum. It is true that he did not go so far as to say that if the conference which met at the end of the period failed to reach agreement, the procedures would go on as before. But he made it clear that during that conference nothing would happen. In fact what he was really saying was that the position would be exactly as it is today. We are, as it is, confident that the Soviet Government will not take unilateral action until the end of the present conference. But we cannot be certain that they will not do so if the present negotiations fail to result in Four Power agreement. In other words, <pb xml:id="pg_937" n="937" facs="0962"/>on <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s above explanation we would be no worse off during the conference which would convene at the end of the period than we are during the present conference.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary suggests we have seriously to consider what, if this is the position, are the merits of a moratorium of the kind which the Russians have proposed. The alternative course is to continue to press them for an explicit re-affirmation that the procedures concerning access would continue indefinitely unless modified by Four Power agreement. This would have been the effect of the West’s June 16 proposal, if they had accepted it. But of course they did not accept it, saying that the theme of occupation status ran all through it. Our proposal of June 16, if the Russians had accepted it, would in effect have constituted a new contract between the Four Powers guaranteeing free access to Berlin until reunification. This would have great advantages, but we cannot conceal from ourselves that it is very doubtful whether the Russians could be brought to conclude a contract of this character. Moreover, it could be argued that even if they did, there are many ways that could be taken to eat into it and almost nullify it by indirect pressures. It seems therefore that we should carefully examine the idea of a moratorium for say two and a half years, provided it is expressed in acceptable terms. One argument in favour is the point that we are more likely to be able to negotiate this with the Russians. Also it would leave us in fact if not in theory in as strong a position at the end of the interim period as would any agreement of a more contractual character apparently designed to last longer.</p>
<p>In order to get a moratorium on acceptable terms it might of course be necessary to agree to some modifications in the existing situation, e.g. in relation to “activities” in Berlin, the operation of the “procedures” by Germans if it is found that the Russians want this to be done at once, and even perhaps in relation to the level of Western troops.</p>
<p>The great virtue of a moratorium is that a great deal can happen during the period which it covers. Things may not necessarily run against us everywhere. If we can get some sort of system of contacts going between the two parts of Germany, the result may even be that we should be better placed at the end of the period than we are at present.</p>
<p>A major difficulty would of course be to decide what we should agree to have happen during the period as far as these contacts between the two parts of Germany are concerned. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has proposed a Committee composed of representatives of the two “states” on a parity basis. There is also the idea which was at one point privately advanced by the United States Delegation to the British and the French of a Four Power Commission to be set to work during the period of a moratorium. Perhaps some compromise between the two could be found. In this connection it was perhaps interesting that <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> told the Foreign <pb xml:id="pg_938" n="938" facs="0963"/>Secretary on Saturday that if a Four Power Commission with German advisers were established, he would not in the least bit mind West German advisers meeting alone with the East German advisers, provided they did so in order to discuss subjects remitted to them by the Commission itself. There may be the germ of a compromise idea in this remark of <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>’s.</p>
<p>As to the period of a moratorium, the Foreign Secretary would suggest we might go for two and a half years, as this would carry us over the German elections. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> might object on the ground that his one and a half years was itself a compromise between the one year period which the Russians originally proposed and the two and a half years suggested by ourselves in quite a different context in our peace plan. In the last resort we might settle for two years, since this would bring us to the eve of the elections, and the summoning of the conference might without difficulty be postponed for a month or two. But in the opinion of the Foreign Secretary we should certainly start by asking for two and half years if we hope to get two.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary has asked me to explain that what I am conveying to you are thoughts and not formal proposals. We have not spoken to the French or Germans along these lines, and should hope to have your comments before we do so. May I ask you to let me know as soon as it would be convenient for me to see you?</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Friend, I have been trying during the last day or two to take stock of the Geneva position. It is not very easy to follow developments there from a distance. I am now much clearer in my own mind after <pb xml:id="pg_939" n="939" facs="0964"/>hearing <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>’s explanation of the developments during the last few days before the conference recessed. I was very glad to learn how closely <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Chris Herter</persName> and he have been working together throughout. I thought that <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s general exposition of our case upon his return to Washington was admirable.</p>
<p>We shall never know for certain why on June 10 <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> appeared to revert to the method of ultimatum and repeated it in his speech of the 19th. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s latest paper of June 19 is obscure. Read in conjunction with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech it could still contain a concealed ultimatum insofar as it implies that the Western presence in Berlin is only tolerated on sufferance, and by reason of an interim agreement, and might cease to have any justification at the end of the interim period or when a peace treaty had been signed with East Germany. I think, however, that it is meant to be slightly more accommodating towards us. This may well be a sort of clumsy response to your initiative with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d416fn1">See <ref target="#d395">Document 395</ref>.</note> I believe he was in fact impressed by what you said, and made an effort at least to appear to meet your conditions for a Summit. His intemperate speech may, on this hypothesis, have been a tactical move to cover his retreat.</p>
<p>The question now is, what are we to do next. I have read <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>’s messages to <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Chris Herter</persName>, and agree with them. It seems to me that we have some fundamental questions to consider. Are we likely to get a settlement of the Berlin question now, which we can expect to last until “the reunification of Germany”? I do not think myself that there is any chance of the Soviet Government actually underwriting our occupation rights. In any case, the Russians have many physical and geographical advantages where Berlin is concerned, and could always exert economic and other pressures which it would be difficult to pin-point. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>, for example, told <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> that if there were 200,000 unemployed in West Berlin, the high morale there would rapidly disappear.</p>
<p>I wonder therefore whether there is not a good deal to be said for aiming now at some interim settlement which will be relatively easier for the Russians to accept and which they will be likely to honour. This at any rate would gain us substantial time. A settlement of this kind must, of course, be such that at the end of the interim period we are no worse off than at the beginning, in the sense that there must then be a new negotiation about all the topics in dispute. Moreover, it would have to be such that, while the new negotiation was on, no unilateral action would be taken by the Soviets. The Russians must not therefore be able to point to any phrases in an interim agreement which imply that at the end of the period we should have less justification for keeping our <pb xml:id="pg_940" n="940" facs="0965"/>troops in Berlin than we had at the beginning. We must not expressly or impliedly seem to set a term to our position in Berlin. The interim settlement must be a pause—though a prolonged pause—in the negotiations.</p>
<p>If the idea of an interim arrangement were accepted in principle, there would of course be argument about its duration. But this, not being a matter of principle, ought to be capable of negotiation. We ought also to be able to negotiate without much trouble a final formula about the use of West Berlin for propaganda or subversion, the exclusion of atomic weapons and the level of troops. The main difficulty about an interim settlement is whether we can devise some means by which contact between the two sets of German representatives can be arranged under acceptable conditions. If we could find an appropriate form for such contact, I doubt if we have anything to fear from the substance of the discussions. I should have thought there were quite a lot of subjects on which the West Germans could well take the offensive, e.g. religious freedom, free press, exchange of information, human rights and all the rest.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can add some general thought. We must maintain a public posture in which we can rally our people to resist a Russian attempt to impose their will by force. All the same, it would not be easy to persuade the British people that it was their duty to go to war in defence of West Berlin. After all, in my lifetime we have been dealt two nearly mortal blows by the Germans. People in this country will think it paradoxical, to use a mild term, to have to prepare for an even more horrible war in order to defend the liberties of people who have tried to destroy us twice in this century. Nevertheless, there is a double strain of idealism and realism in these islands to which I believe I could successfully appeal if we had first demonstrated that we have made every endeavour to put forward practical solutions and that the Russians were unwilling to accept any fair proposition. The corollary to this is that we and our allies should do and should be seen to do what ordinary people would think reasonable. For instance, it would not seem reasonable to ordinary people that West Germans who profess to desire closer contacts and reunification with the East Germans should refuse absolutely to discuss these matters in any forum with the East Germans.</p>
<p>I wish of course that we could meet and talk. It is so difficult to put on paper all that one feels. I hope therefore you will not mind my sending you these frank thoughts. Do tell me what you think.</p>
<p>With warm regards, As ever,</p>

<p>2653. Eyes only Secretary. Re <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2637.<note n="1" xml:id="d417fn1">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 762.00/6–2459)</note> Following is verbatim text of Thayer’s notes of that portion of <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> relating to Berlin and Germany.</p>
<p>“You may tell anyone you want,” <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said in some heat, “that we will never accept <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> as a representative of Germany. He is a zero. There is a current joke in Russia that if you look at Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> naked from behind, he shows Germany divided. If you look at him from the front, he demonstrates that Germany cannot stand.</p>
<p>“We will not agree to your taking over Western Germany. We will not agree to a united Germany that is not socialist. In fact, no one wants a united Germany. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> told us so; the British have told us so; and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> himself when he was here said he was not interested in unification. Why, then do you insist on talking about it?</p>
<p>“You state you want to defend the two million people in West Berlin. We are prepared to give any guarantees you desire to perpetuate their present social structure, either under the supervision of neutral countries or under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. However, we are absolutely determined to liquidate the state of war with Germany. It is an anachronism. Furthermore, we are determined to liquidate your rights in Western Berlin. What good does it do you to have 11 thousand troops in Berlin? If it came to war, we would swallow them in one gulp. We will agree to your maintaining them for a limited period but not indefinitely. If you do not agree to a termination of the occupation, we will do it unilaterally. Furthermore, we will put an end to your rights in Berlin. If you want to use force to preserve your rights, you can be sure that we will respond with force. You can start a war if you want, but remember it will be you who are starting it, not we. If you want to perpetuate or prolong your rights, this means war. You recognized West Germany on conditions contrary to those agreed upon during the war. We do not recognize the right of <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> to determine our position in Germany. If you continue to operate from a position of strength, then you must decide for yourselves. We too are strong and we will decide for ourselves.”</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_942" n="942" facs="0967"/>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> pointed out that this position was appallingly dangerous and suggested that the great achievements and the internal development of the Soviet Union would be sacrificed by any war.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> retorted that this was his position and that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> could tell Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> replied that he would carry no messages to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> as he was a private individual. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> retorted that “If I see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, I will tell him just as I have told you.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> expressed a hope that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would prove more amiable with the Foreign Ministers’ Conference reconvened on the 13th of July in Geneva. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> retorted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was reflecting the views of the <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Government and that if he did not, he would be fired and replaced, and the views of the <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Govt were what he had just said. “We have had German troops twice in the <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> Union and we know what it means. This the United States does not know nor has it experienced the tears that the Ukraine suffered under occupation.” When it was suggested that Russia brought the Germans on them by the Ribbentrop–Molotov Pact, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> scornfully rejected the argument as a “cheap” question. “We know England and France wanted to turn Hitler against Russia. Stalin did right in making a pact with Hitler and we would do it again. History”, he said, “may not repeat itself, but the day may come when Germany will turn against the West.” “Are you sure,” he asked, “that they won’t? Of course, <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> could not, but maybe <persName corresp="#p_SFJ1">Strauss</persName> or some other German would. West Germany knows that we could destroy it in ten minutes. If Germany faces the question of whether to exist or not, its decision may be different from that of today.” When it was suggested that Moscow and Leningrad were equally susceptible to destruction, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> retorted that Leningrad is not Russia. Irkutsk and other Siberian cities would remain, but “one bomb is sufficient to destroy Bonn and the Ruhr, and that is all of Germany. Paris is all of France; London is all of England. You have surrounded us with bases but our rockets can destroy them. If you start a war, we may die but the rockets will fly automatically.”</p>
<p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> suggested that if the <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s hindered the legal rights of supply of our troops in Berlin, it would be dangerous.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied heatedly that “We would do just that. We would liquidate your rights. We will permit the troops now there to remain but not any troops to enter. If you speak from a position of strength, we will answer with the same strength.” Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stated that the American determination to support two million Berliners should not be underestimated. “We will never permit their being sacrificed,” he stated.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> answered, “Don’t think that the Soviet Union is all ill-shod (lapki) as it was when the Czars sold Alaska to you. We are <pb xml:id="pg_943" n="943" facs="0968"/>ready to fight. We are not aggressive,” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said. “We will let Berlin have its social structure and guarantee it. We don’t need West Berlin. What are two million people to a bloc of 900 million people? If we took West Berlin, we would simply have to feed it. We would rather let you feed it.” Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> suggested that Soviet decisions with regard to Berlin should not be taken too lightly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that it had all been carefully thought out. “Don’t you think otherwise,” he said. “Your generals talk of tanks and guns defending your Berlin position. They would burn,” he said. “We don’t want war over Berlin. Perhaps you do if you want to prolong the current position.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stated that West Berliners were now perfectly satisfied. Why change the situation? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that he would guarantee the situation in West Berlin in any manner we saw fit, “but we must end the state of war and the consequences of war and not interfere in the internal affairs of Germany.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, “We cannot tolerate the condition any more and this is a historic fact. Furthermore,” he said, “<persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is the most unpopular man in Germany.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> pointed out that there had been many possibilities to throw out <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> but the Germans had not done so. On the other hand, there had never been any possibility to throw <persName corresp="#p_GO1">Grotewohl</persName> out. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> retorted, “What you and I think about freedom and slavery is quite different. We, for instance, consider the choice of Rockefeller impossible to understand, but we will let you decide for yourselves in the United States. You may have millions, but I have grandsons.”</p>

<dateline><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1959-06-25">June 25, 1959</date>.</dateline>
<p>I met with the President this morning at 8:30 to discuss the communication which he had received from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold Macmillan</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d418fn1"><ref target="#d416">Document 416</ref>.</note> and the one that I had received from <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d418fn2">See <ref target="#d415fn1">footnote 1, Document 415</ref>.</note> dealing with the negotiations on Germany at Geneva.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_944" n="944" facs="0969"/>
<p>At the outset the President showed me a telegram from Moscow<note n="3" xml:id="d418fn3"><ref target="#d417">Document 417</ref>.</note> outlining <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName>’s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The President was really concerned by the state of mind that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was apparently indicating, although he was not certain whether this was an additional effort to threaten us into a Summit Conference or whether it represented genuine views.</p>
<p>I then showed him the draft of a letter<note n="4" xml:id="d418fn4">Printed as attachment A.</note> we had prepared as an answer to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>. I asked the President not to pass on this until he had had a chance to think over the draft of a proposed communiqué in which we had outlined some positions which might be taken at the forthcoming meeting in Geneva (copy attached herewith). The President read through the paper with great care. He said that he felt that if we reached such agreement as appeared in the paper, even though the number of troops to be stationed in Berlin and the number of years that the arrangement should last were not specified, it would warrant going to a Summit meeting and that perhaps those two matters might be settled there. I said the paper had originally been drafted with that very thing in mind and actually specified that the blanks should be resolved at a meeting of the Heads of State but that I had then asked for a redraft so that it would come to the President, in the first instance, as a Foreign Ministers’ agreement. I told the President that the paper was not an agreed paper of the Department in that several of our senior advisers, including Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, had serious doubts as to whether the mention of any deadline would be considered an excessive weakening on our part. I explained to the President that whether deadlines were mentioned or not, we were actually under the threat of a deadline all the time and that part of our draft represented a moratorium for X period of time. I said I felt that the President should consider alternatives, the last one of which would, of course, be allied unity on the question of going to war, a unity it would be hard to achieve in the light of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s last letter unless a Summit Conference had been held and all remedies exhausted. I also told him that the draft we had prepared followed very closely <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>’s thinking, although we had reached our points of view somewhat separately. The President said he would give the matter further thought and that we would discuss it again. In the meanwhile he was going to try to redraft the answer to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and try to be a little more forthcoming than we had been in our suggested draft.</p>

<p>Draft Letter From President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName></p>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName>: I was glad to have your letter assessing the situation at the close of the present phase of the Foreign Ministers Conference and suggesting a line which we might take when the Conference resumes on July 13.</p>
<p>We too have been considering where we go from here. We are working very hard on the issues which the Conference has developed. Chris will be touch with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> on the thoughts which the latter has conveyed to him. I hope that we may be able to work out a concerted position in time to consult with the French and Germans before July 13th. The issues are so large and the time so short that this may not be possible. However, we shall do our best.<note n="6" xml:id="d418fn6"><p>On June 27, the President replied to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> with a note incorporating these two paragraphs and adding the following three:</p>
<p>“I agree with you, of course, that our tactical position in Berlin is indeed weak in that the Russians have many physical and geographical advantages. Their opportunity to exert economic pressure against the Western part of the city is obvious.</p>
<p>“Because Chris is, as I say, communicating to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> our current thinking for an ad interim arrangement, I think it would be futile for me to try to get into details at this point. I can say only that I have studied his paper and agree generally with it.</p>
<p>“Yesterday Mamie and I spent the day with the Queen and Prince <persName corresp="#p_ZPFD1">Philip</persName>. The Prime Minister of Canada was of course present. I noted with some interest that he repeated what I believe has been an earlier suggestion of his—that Quebec might be a nice place to hold a summit meeting if one should ever become practical. I merely replied that the place would be most convenient from my viewpoint, but the location and time made very little difference to me.” (Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204)</p></note></p>

<p>Draft Communiqué Containing Agreed Recommendations of Foreign Ministers</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministers of the French Republic, UK, USSR and the United States of America met in Geneva from May 11 to June, 19, 1959 [and] from July 13 to ————, 1959.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_946" n="946" facs="0971"/>
<p>The meeting was convened to consider questions relating to Germany, including a peace treaty with Germany, and Berlin. The discussions which were carried on in the course of the meeting regarding Germany established that the Foreign Ministers all agreed that Germany should be reunified, that there should be free elections held for this purpose, and that there should be a final German peace settlement at the earliest practicable time. The Foreign Ministers were unable to agree upon procedures for achieving these ends.</p>
<p>In order to further the solution of these questions the Foreign Ministers have agreed to recommend to their respective Governments the following proposals:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) That a four-power commission be established to continue the discussion of the German problem and to examine questions connected with the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.</item>
<item>(b) That the four-power commission make appropriate arrangement for the cooperation of German advisors, who would be requested to discuss and propose concrete measures for the reunification of Germany, with free elections at an appropriate stage in the process, and to propose agreed principles for a peace treaty with Germany. The advisors would also be requested to transmit proposals for the extension and development of technical contacts between the two parts of Germany and the free movement of persons, ideas and publications between the two parts of Germany.</item>
<item>(c) Unless agreement has been reached on plans for reunification and for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany at an earlier date, the Foreign Ministers will reconvene at the end of ———— years to continue their discussion of these subjects.</item>
</list>
<p>The Foreign Ministers will further recommend to their respective governments consideration be given to alleviation of tensions in Berlin by adoption of measures along the following lines in the light of the existing situation and agreements at present in force:</p>
<list>
<item>(a) The Western Powers would establish a ceiling upon the combined total of their armed forces in Berlin which would be in the neighborhood of ———— troops.</item>
<item>(b) The Four Powers would continue to arm their forces in Berlin only with conventional weapons.</item>
<item>(c) Access to Berlin by land, by water, and by air for all persons, goods and communications, including those of the forces of the Western Powers stationed in Berlin, would be maintained in accordance with the procedures in effect in April 1959. All disputes which might arise with respect to access would be raised and settled between the four governments except that a resident four-power commission would be established in West Berlin which would in the first instance consider any difficulties arising in connection with access and would seek to settle such difficulties. This commission would make use of German advisors as necessary.</item>
<item>(d) Measures would be taken, consistent with fundamental rights and liberties to avoid within or directed at Berlin activities which might <pb xml:id="pg_947" n="947" facs="0972"/>either disrupt public order or seriously affect the rights and interests, or aim to interfere in the internal affairs, of others. A representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations, supported by adequate staff, would be established in Berlin, with free access to all parts of the city for the purpose of monitoring propaganda activities in the light of the foregoing principles, and to report to the Secretary General any such activities in Berlin or directed at Berlin which appear to be in conflict with such principles. The four governments would consult with the Secretary General in order to determine the appropriate action to be taken in respect to any such report.</item>
</list>
<p>The Foreign Ministers will also recommend that the arrangements specified in sub-paragraphs (a) through (d) above will remain in effect until reunification of Germany provided that, in the absence of reunification, or agreed plans for reunification, the Foreign Ministers will meet at the end of ————— years to review these arrangements.</p>

He then read to <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> excerpts from the preliminary report received from our Ambassador in Moscow of the <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to supplement the summary of this conversation attached to the Secretary’s letter.<note n="3" xml:id="d419fn3">Not further identified.</note> In response to the Secretary’s query as to whether the <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> report would be published, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> indicated that, since <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> was seeing <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as a former ambassador to the Soviet Union and not in his capacity as journalist, it would presumably not be published.</p>
<p>After <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> had stressed the urgency of moving ahead with the Western preparations for resumption of the Geneva Conference, the Secretary said he had gone over at considerable length with the President certain ideas similar to those expressed by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> in his message. While there might be some possibilities in the moratorium concept, the Secretary indicated, we must have assurance that Western rights would not be diminished at the end of the given time period.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> noted that the difficulty was in determining the basic Soviet position in view of the different statements made by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, to the press and to individual journalists. The Soviets should be smoked out in the conference room, so that the West would know where it stood. If a satisfactory agreement could be reached on a moratorium period, the question would arise as to just what might be accomplished during the interval. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> had shown a certain receptivity to the idea of German advisers putting their heads together under cover of a Four Power commission. He noted that, in the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statement to <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, the campaign of invective against <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> continued. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> commented that the question about this most recent <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> effusion was whether it represented genuine conviction or was merely a case of play-acting. The Secretary added that, when <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> presented the Soviet “ultimatum” proposals at Geneva, this was interpreted by some as an effort by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to frighten the West into the Summit and thus to enter it on his part in a strong tactical position.</p>
<p>In response to <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName>’s query as to what he might say about United States thinking on the possibility of a moratorium, the Secretary said that we were trying to reduce the concept to a more precise form in order to see its full implications. The President had a draft in front of him,<note n="4" xml:id="d419fn4">See attachment B to <ref target="#d418">Document 418</ref>.</note> but no decision had been made and we could not be sure what would finally emerge. If agreement were reached on some formula, we might be in a more advantageous position than the British to take it up with the French and the Germans. We would try to have something more precise <pb xml:id="pg_949" n="949" facs="0974"/>by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> agreed that United States support of any proposal would carry more weight with the French and Germans than primary advocacy by the British.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> noted that, despite exaggerated press accounts, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had tried to be careful yesterday in the Commons relative to a Summit meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d419fn5">For text of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s statement to the House of Commons, June 24, see 607 House of Commons, <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Debates</hi>, 5th Series, cols. 1027–1028.</note> He had expressed the hope that the resumed Geneva Conference would permit a Summit meeting to take place. Obviously the British Government still wanted such a Summit meeting, <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> continued, but it also wanted to avoid any open break between the Western Powers on this subject. On the assumption that the optimistic interpretation of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s press statement of June 19<note n="6" xml:id="d419fn6">For text of this statement, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 332–334 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd</hi>. 868, pp. 238–239.</note> was warranted and would be reflected in the Soviet position when the Geneva Conference resumed, the British were wondering how tactically the subject of a Summit could best be handled. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> suggested that it would be desirable if the United States could take the initiative and not leave it to the Soviets to propose a Summit meeting. Perhaps the questions of a precise time period and of the level of troops might be left for decision at the Summit. The Secretary commented that all this depended on the actual progress made by the Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>Both the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> agreed that it would be better if the Italian proposal for a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ministerial meeting prior to the resumption of the Geneva Conference were dropped. The Secretary made the point that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ministers always seemed to want to know what the Western fall-back position is. As soon as this is discussed it tends to become public property. He believed that a factor at Geneva was that the Soviets had heard so much about Western fall-back positions that they could not believe we had none. [<hi rend="italic">5-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> again stressed the urgency of preparing a Western position for Germany. It was desirable, he said, to get something to <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> before he left for Madagascar in order to avoid any feeling that the United Kingdom and the United States were “plotting behind his back” while he was away on a trip. The Secretary noted that one problem was how much <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> could agree to which the Germans would not accept. It was possible that some tight arrangement existed between the French and Germans to support each others’ views in all respects. The Secretary added that we must make clear that a decision on a moratorium, which would be a big decision to take, must involve a careful evaluation of Western interests in terms of possible alternatives.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_950" n="950" facs="0975"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> expressed the opinion that, if agreement on the Summit could not be reached as a result of the Foreign Ministers’ meeting, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would then put on pressure and demand a Summit under crisis conditions. Under such circumstances, the British would be strongly impelled to accept.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said that he was taking the line with the Press that his call on the Secretary was to have a general tour d’horizon since it was their first meeting after the Secretary’s return from Geneva. In order to make this line an honest one, he wished to raise briefly a number of other subjects (covered in separate memoranda of conversation).<note n="7" xml:id="d419fn7">The only other memorandum of conversation between <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> on June 25 that has been found is a five-line memorandum on Laos.

<p>2665. Fol luncheon for <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> yesterday he, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, Kozlov, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and I had nearly two-hour discussion which centered mostly on Germany and Berlin. Following are highlights; full text by despatch.<note n="1" xml:id="d420fn1">Despatches 739 and 741 from Moscow, June 29. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> Trip)</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was serious but genial and repeatedly asserted his desire for a peaceful settlement of their differences with us. He suggested we should draw appropriate lessons from history which US did not appreciate as much as Soviet Union which had twice been invaded by Germany. I replied historic lesson we drew was that we should not repeat error following First World War of giving Germany grounds for thinking she was being mistreated. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he was not impressed by this argument. He expressed his contempt for <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> who had tried to flatter him and was trying to stir up trouble not only between Soviet <pb xml:id="pg_951" n="951" facs="0976"/>Union and West but also between Western allies, particularly France and Britain. I said our experience with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> had shown that he genuinely wanted to prevent a recurrence of German militarism and had wholeheartedly supported plans for European integration which would prevent this. He said we must face German problem seriously and recognize that <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> could never agree. West would never consent to a Communist Germany and he would never agree to <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s absorbing East Germany. Best plan was to conclude a peace treaty and liquidate remains of war. When I pointed out we had recognized present situation by providing for a phased plan he said we had allowed 2 and one-half years whereas he would prefer 250 years. When <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out our plan based on elections <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said West would not allow Vietnam to be absorbed through free elections and how could we expect Soviet Union to allow <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> to absorb far more important area of East Germany. It was clear that a reunited Germany would join <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. West wanted them to allow greater population of West Germany to decide issue. He had no good answer to my argument that our plan provided for possibility separate vote in two parts of Germany. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> asked me if we would ever allow West Germany to opt for socialism. I said he would doubtless not believe me but I was sure that if West Germany took such a decision in a supervised election that was not under pressure of threats, we would abide by the decision. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said I had best be careful and was I so sure that this might not one day happen after Soviets had continued to improve their own economic position and standard of living in East Germany had been raised. He said that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> did not want German reunification for fear Germany would go socialist.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said it was clear German question could not be settled now and he had therefore put forward his Berlin proposal. He had developed the free city solution personally although his associates agreed with him. He was prepared to give almost any kind of guarantee for the free city. He emphasized importance that Soviet Govt, which came to power after death of Stalin, attached to keeping its word and that it would faithfully fulfill any guarantee given. We should know that when discussions were resumed in Geneva we should not expect change in Soviet position as they could not go beyond proposals already put forward. He understood our position to be that if there was no agreement in Geneva there would be no summit conference. If this were so, very well, but he would then conclude separate peace treaty and our occupation rights would cease to exist. He kept his temper when I inquired how he could reconcile this statement with his previous remarks about the importance the Soviet Govt attached to keeping its word. This led to a long and inconclusive argument about who was to blame for breakdown of four power cooperation in Germany. He pointed to our conclusion <pb xml:id="pg_952" n="952" facs="0977"/>of separate treaty with Japan. When I said we had reserved Soviet rights he replied that they had been kicked out of Allied Council and we had established military bases in Japan. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> interjected they would give us same deal on Germany as we had given them on Japan.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> asked what was wrong with Soviet proposal. He emphasized that West Berlin and its population were of no importance to Soviet Union. I said I could believe this but Berlin was clearly important to East Germans who wanted to absorb it and Soviet proposals seemed to us clearly designed to facilitate this objective.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> referred to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s speech<note n="2" xml:id="d420fn2">For text of <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s address to the nation on June 23, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, July 13, 1959, pp. 43–45 or <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 342–346.</note> which he characterized as an incorrect statement of the position. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not intended to make public statement but would now be obliged to put record straight.</p>
<p>I referred to his earlier statement that Soviet Union had made its maximum offer and said I thought same was true of West although various combinations of essential elements of our offer were possible. He then suggested that perhaps we should cancel the meeting. I replied that I was not conducting negotiations with him but merely trying to explain my understanding of my govt’s position. I explained this in some detail referring to Soviet action in disposing of East Berlin and now trying to move in on West Berlin. When I outlined the concessions we had made and the distance we had gone to meet his position he said he had carefully examined our proposal which did in fact contain many constructive elements. It was not bad except for one fact and that was that it was to operate until German reunification which was completely unacceptable. It might be all right as an interim arrangement to operate until a peace treaty could be drawn up and concluded.</p>
<p>I referred to a remark he had made that our troops in Berlin had no military value and that even if we had 100,000 there they would be wiped out immediately in the event of war. I asked why was he then so anxious to get rid of them. He replied that while they would have no military value in the event of war they did have a military value now. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> explained that subversive organizations in Berlin operated under the protection of Western troops. If peace treaty were signed they could no longer fulfill this function. I said this indicated that Soviet Union or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would decide which organizations were legitimate and which were not. This would constitute interference in internal affairs of Berlin and showed clearly where Soviet proposals would lead. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said this was an exaggerated interpretation.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_953" n="953" facs="0978"/>
<p>I also referred to the lack of reciprocity in Soviet proposals on propaganda etc. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said it was obviously impossible to control activities in East Germany and allow Bonn to be free to continue them. I said we recognized this and were prepared to deal with it but could not accept arrangements on this matter that applied to West Berlin but not East Berlin.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> referred to holding of presidential election in West Berlin as a provocative act but not in any manner suggesting Soviets intended to do anything about it.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then told anecdote to illustrate theses I was merely repeating old arguments.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> emphasized strongly that both parties in US supported President’s position on Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> suggested that while political parties might be in agreement some of our people were not but he recognized they had to deal with our govt. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> concluded conversation by saying we should work out an interim arrangement that would lead to a peace treaty and he suggested this could be done in a way to avoid any aspect of an ultimatum.</p>
<p>Unless Dept perceives objection I propose inform my French, British and German colleagues of this conversation.</p>

Pertinent extracts follow:</p>
<p>(1) “Size of garrison has little bearing on over-all picture in military sense under all out war conditions. Under lesser conditions of <pb xml:id="pg_954" n="954" facs="0979"/>hostility or various stages of civil disorders, size of Berlin garrison important and vital. Under conditions limited hostilities or civil emergency, garrison must be capable of providing for security US personnel, property, units and agencies in Berlin.”</p>
<p>(2) “Requirements for military forces in event civil disturbances probably single most important military factor in strength of garrison. Soviets and East Germans have capability creating and directing civil disturbances which would be serious threat to security West Berlin even if present combined capability of Allied military and West Berlin police brought to bear. Even threat such action would require employment large part military force initially to protect property such as airport (for evacuation personnel), depots, barracks, sensitive installations, dependents quarters and accesses thereto. Present carefully considered and agreed Berlin Allied plans, under plausible conditions civil disorder, require employment entire West Berlin police force and military garrisons. This concept recently proven in comprehensive joint CPX in which Allied military and West Berlin police actively participated.”</p>
<p>(3) “Furthermore there danger if size of Allied garrisons curtailed to level where aggressiveness on part of Soviets and/or East Germans is encouraged or to extent where quick coup could wipe out or subdue entire garrison and face Allies with ‘fait accompli’ in Berlin.”</p>
<p><gloss target="#t_reftel1">Reftel</gloss> describes predictable <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> effort to audit our troop strength by control measures if garrison levels fixed by agreement.</p>
<p>From political and psychological point of view, reduction in garrison levels at this time—even voluntary—would have deleterious effect on Berlin morale. Fact of reduction itself would be judged by many Berliners as evidence Allied weakness foreshadowing eventual phase-out Allied physical presence in city.</p>

</list>
<p>Mr. Kozlov noted that he had spent a couple of days in New York and Washington and that so far it has been a very useful visit.</p>
<p>The Secretary expressed the opinion that Mr. Kozlov had had very good reception everywhere he had gone and that he must be tired of seeing his picture in the papers.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov recalled his visit to the construction site of the U.S. atomic ship <hi rend="italic">Savannah</hi> and said that American engineers were very much interested in the Soviet atomic ice-breaker <hi rend="italic">Lenin</hi>, a model of which is exhibited in New York. He also recalled seeing the full-scale model of the reactor that is to be used in the <hi rend="italic">Savannah</hi>. He said that American engineers showed great interest in the Soviet reactor model that is on display in New York; they would like to see it and exchange experiences with Soviet technicians so as to eliminate the deficiencies that might exist in their designs. Thus contacts had been found between the engineers of our two countries, in the most important, even cardinal area, of modern technology. It was now up to the diplomats to render assistance to such contacts.</p>
<p>The Secretary remarked that help from the other side would be needed too, and that both sides should display willingness to reach agreement if any success was to be reached in international negotiations.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov, referring to the Foreign Ministers Conference in Geneva, stated that the Soviet position was clear and that the West had <pb xml:id="pg_956" n="956" facs="0981"/>failed to give a reply to that position. The Soviet proposals were a real basis for improving the relations between our countries. The abcess in Central Europe must be removed—this would immediately bring about a healthier situation in that area.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that he wanted to speak frankly and reconstruct the history of the Geneva discussions. He said that the Soviet Union apparently felt that the situation in Berlin was displeasing to it and that it was fraught with danger, danger which is rather difficult for us to understand. As a result of this feeling, the Soviet Union, instead of taking diplomatic or other steps, took a very severe line and said that the Western powers should get out of Berlin and that if they didn’t get out of Berlin within a certain period of time certain things would happen. The first indication of Soviet dissatisfaction had almost been in the form of an ultimatum.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov replied that he believed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> himself is displeased with the situation in Berlin. After all 14 years have elapsed since the war and both sides should think out ways of changing that situation. Also speaking frankly, Mr. Kozlov said, the Soviet proposals were in no way an ultimatum—such an interpretation was an artificial one. The Soviet Union proposes that for one year or some other period of time an all-German committee should work and if that work should produce no concrete results new negotiations should be initiated. The Soviet proposal was for negotiations and thus was not an ultimatum. As to the period of time to be allowed for the work of an all-German committee, this question could be discussed again so as to reach agreement on a mutually acceptable time limit. The question of the time limit is not a question of principle; however, the question of liquidating the occupation regime in West Berlin is a question of principle, since the situation in West Berlin is abnormal. The people themselves dislike it and the parties concerned should agree to terminate that situation 14 years after the war.</p>
<p>The Secretary rejoined by saying that if Mr. Kozlov, in mentioning the people, wanted to say that the population of West Berlin was unhappy and wanted a change, then he should remember the fact that last December that population had had an opportunity to express its will in free elections and had indicated its preference for the continuation of the present situation. The U.S. is also of the opinion that the situation in Berlin is an abnormal one and that the Berlin problem should be resolved; however, as far as the time limit is concerned, the U.S. took the position that the time limit should be the time of the unification of Germany. The Western peace plan<note n="1" xml:id="d422fn1">See <ref target="#d295fn1">footnote 1, Document 295</ref>.</note> had been put forward in good faith and it provided for an all-German committee which would have to work out an electoral <pb xml:id="pg_957" n="957" facs="0982"/>law. Mr. Kozlov had mentioned the wishes of the people—the U.S. has no desire to go against the wishes of the people, but it knows of no way to learn about these wishes other than free elections. The Western powers had proposed that if no decision were reached by the all-German committee then two alternatives should be placed before the German people. If the German people, in a free vote, expressed themselves for separate solutions for the two parts of Germany, the Western powers would respect that wish. On the other hand, we had hoped that if the German people expressed themselves for a unified solution, that the Soviet Union would respect that wish too. However, the Soviet Union rejected all these proposals.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov said that no harm would be done if the two Germanys were given an opportunity to sit down, argue, and try to resolve their problem. Both sides would assist them in their work, but the main thing is for the Germans to sit down and to decide on the conditions for unification. If a solution is found, then the West Berlin problem will be resolved also. This would be particularly true in view of the fact that the Soviet Union has proposed that the West Berlin population select its own social system. The Soviet Union never has and never will insist on changing that social order, although there had been false statements to that effect. If the West Berlin population wanted to continue having their present social order, that would be all right with the Soviet Union. Access to the city would also be free. As far as the question of troops in West Berlin is concerned, it had been also constructively outlined in Soviet proposals. The Western powers say, Mr. Kozlov continued, that they cannot abandon to the Soviet Union’s mercy 2.2 million people— but the Soviet Union doesn’t want that at all. If the West Berlin population likes Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>, that is all right with the Soviet Union. However, the occupation regime can no longer be tolerated and especially so in view of the fact that the occupation regime includes propaganda against East Germany and the USSR. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> also speculates on the present situation and uses it for his own purposes; recently he took a step that the Soviet Union could not call a very good one. The Soviet Union wants to change this entire situation peacefully, through negotiation. Referring to the Secretary’s remark that the West Berlin population had expressed itself in favor of the present order, Mr. Kozlov said that the Soviet Union had nothing against that. True, the Soviet Union would never recognize <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s claim for West Berlin, but it would never disregard the will of the population, who should select their social order themselves. The Soviet Union is of the opinion that never, in any area of the world, can a social order, socialist or capitalist, be imposed from above by force. As for West Berlin, the Soviet Union would gain no advantage, political or economic, from a change in the social order there. The Soviet Union is prepared to give guarantees to world public opinion <pb xml:id="pg_958" n="958" facs="0983"/>that it would fulfill its commitments with regard to West Berlin and the G.D.R. has also expressed its readiness to do the same.</p>
<p>The Secretary said he wanted to comment on one particular point. Mr. Kozlov had said that in no area of the world could socialism or capitalism be imposed by force. The Secretary stated that Mr. Kozlov would probably realize that he would question that statement, particularly as far as East Berlin or East Germany was concerned. The Soviet Union has complete control over these areas and it was our hope that it would allow the people in these areas to express their will freely. The Soviet Union has some 27 divisions in East Germany and the people in that area have had no opportunity to speak.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov said that the German people had voted more than once for the existing social order and that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Ulbricht</persName> and other East German leaders had been approved by the German people and had been elected to the Reichstag, as representatives of the German people, even earlier, under the capitalist system that had existed before Hitler.</p>
<p>The U.S., however, should realize that there are two German states in existence now and that they should decide themselves with regard to the basis for the unification of Germany. East Germany and West Germany should work on this problem together. Two wars, in 1914 and 1941, had been fought because of the Germans, and it was now up to them to resolve their own problems. As far as Soviet divisions are concerned, they are stationed in that area under the provisions of the Warsaw Treaty, just as U.S. divisions are stationed in various areas under certain agreements, but that of course was the U.S’s own business.</p>
<p>The Secretary stated that he wanted to raise a point which had been discussed in Geneva several times but had never been clarified, although the Soviet delegation had given many indications as to its position on it. At one point in the course of negotiations the Soviet delegation stated that the Western powers had legal rights in West Berlin and that they had certain rights with regard to the access to Berlin. This was reflected in the <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>-Boltz letters.<note n="2" xml:id="d422fn2">See <ref target="#d31fn5">footnote 5, Document 31</ref>.</note> However, at the same time the Soviet delegation indicated that if the Western powers tried to defend their rights the Soviet Union would take certain steps which might lead to war. The Secretary said that he wanted to know whether his understanding of the Soviet position was correct.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov answered that of course force would be met by force but that the Soviet Union was against force. There should be no talk about force—there should be negotiations on the elimination of the occupation regime in West Berlin. Misunderstandings that have accumulated during the past 14 years should be removed through negotiations <pb xml:id="pg_959" n="959" facs="0984"/>so as to improve the general international situation. The Western position with regard to a reduction in the number of troops in West Berlin and with regard to non-stationing of atomic armaments in that city was also a basis for negotiations, because they were “rational seeds” which should be cultivated.</p>
<p>The Secretary stated that he could not understand how the Western decision not to station atomic weapons could be considered a basis for negotiation. The Western powers had clearly stated that they had no intention of stationing nuclear armaments in West Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov replied that this was a “rational seed” which could be cultivated and developed into something bigger.</p>
<p>The Secretary stated that in Geneva the Western powers had presented a paper on West Berlin<note n="3" xml:id="d422fn3">See <ref target="#d411fn1">footnote 1, Document 411</ref>.</note> which, they believed, went a long way to meet the Soviet point of view. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union rejected that paper. The paper, the Western powers believe, was a clear-cut document and it met the point of danger that the Soviet Union had been referring to. The Western powers hoped that this paper could be again discussed when the conference reconvenes in Geneva.</p>
<p>The Secretary noted that Mr. Kozlov had not answered the point he had raised earlier in the discussion and it is quite disturbing to the Western powers. The Soviet Union admits that the Western powers have rights in West Berlin and with regard to access to West Berlin, yet it says that if there is no success in negotiating then it will take unilateral steps which would render all agreements relating to that area invalid. It is difficult to believe that the Soviet Union, which is a great power in the world, would take a unilateral action, because no great power can renounce unilaterally one agreement without casting doubt on the validity of all other agreements.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov replied that if the negotiations on the West Berlin question should fail the Soviet Union would be forced to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic with all the consequences ensuing from that fact. He recalled that the U.S. itself had contracted unilaterally a peace treaty with Japan in spite of the fact that the U.S. and the Soviet Union had been brothers in arms in World War II. So the Soviet Union would be compelled to do the same, but, Mr. Kozlov said, he wanted to emphasize that the Soviet Union is not in favor of negotiations.</p>
<p>The Secretary stated that as far as the peace treaty with Japan is concerned, the U.S. had reserved completely all Russian rights with respect to that treaty. In this connection he wanted to recall the fact that the <pb xml:id="pg_960" n="960" facs="0985"/>Kurile Islands have been under the Soviet occupation regime for 14 years.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov replied that the Soviet Union could also reserve all rights of all states, including the United States, in the event that a separate peace treaty was signed with East Germany.</p>
<p>The Secretary remarked that of course this could be done very easily and that this was the import of the <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>-Boltz letters, but that in the talks in Geneva the U.S. had gained a different impression.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov observed that impressions may be different. In this connection he wanted to state that the statement made by the Secretary after Geneva had been disappointing.<note n="4" xml:id="d422fn4">For text of <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s address to the natiori on June 23, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 342–346 or Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, July 13, 1959, pp. 43–45.</note></p>
<p>The Secretary said he was sorry if the statement was disappointing to the Soviet Union but it was based on the conclusions reached as a result of six weeks of negotiations. Many things that had been said and proposals that had been made in Geneva gave no alternative for conclusions. The Secretary said that he wanted to cite the following example. The Soviet delegation presented a paper on the status of a free city of Berlin;<note n="5" xml:id="d422fn5">See <ref target="#d415fn4">footnote 4, Document 415</ref>.</note> this paper left the future of the city completely at the mercy of East Germany. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at one point stated that the best solution for West Berlin would be its incorporation in East Germany. Therefore, we believed that this was what the Soviet Union had in mind.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the U.S. is going back to Geneva with hope, but if agreement is to be reached, more give will be needed. The Secretary recalled that any Western proposals, excluding that regarding atomic armaments in Berlin had been rejected outright by the Soviet Union; nevertheless, the U.S. will go back to Geneva in good faith and with the hope that mutually satisfactory agreement will be reached.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov stated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said that the incorporation of West Berlin and East Germany was the best solution, but that he had not said that it was the only one. The Soviet Union realizes that it must take into account the views of the other side; it was for this reason that the Soviet Union had proposed the creation of a free city of West Berlin. The status of the Free City could be ensured by neutral troops and also guaranteed by the United Nations, if the U.S. so desired. However, during the next round in Geneva the negotiators must proceed from the actual situation; they should proceed on the basis that the occupation regime in West Berlin should be eliminated and that West Berlin should be made a free city. Mr. Kozlov said he wanted to emphasize once again that the social order for the city would be chosen by the <pb xml:id="pg_961" n="961" facs="0986"/>population itself, and that no pressure should be exerted on it from either side.</p>
<p>The Secretary said that he realized that Mr. Kozlov had to leave for another appointment and that if Mr. Kozlov wanted to continue the conversation he had set aside some time tomorrow. If Mr. Kozlov thought that there were any points for further discussion, the Secretary said, he would be glad to meet with him again.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlov replied that unfortunately this would be impossible in view of his busy schedule. He said that he would like to have another discussion with the Secretary because he liked his approach to problems. He suggested that perhaps at the end of his tour he might meet with the Secretary again.</p>
<p>The Secretary observed that he was to leave on the morning of July 11 and that if Mr. Kozlov could return from his tour about the U.S. by that time, he could meet with him again.</p>
<p>Before the meeting broke off, the Secretary and Mr. Kozlov agreed that they would say to the Press that they had discussed the problems before the Geneva conference and had exchanged views with regard to the positions the two respective Governments hold.<note n="6" xml:id="d422fn6">Following the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, Kozlov talked with the President from 11:15 to 12:30. Although this conversation dealt largely with other topics, Kozlov reiterated the Soviet view that the occupation regime in Berlin should be terminated. A memorandum of this conversation is in vol. X, Part 1, <ref target="#d79">Document 79</ref>.</note></p>

<p>I remained with the President after his interview with Mr. Kozlov<note n="1" xml:id="d423fn1">See <ref target="#d422fn6">footnote 6, Document 422</ref>.</note> in order to continue our earlier discussion of the paper I had left with him outlining the proposed U.S. position on Berlin.<note n="2" xml:id="d423fn2">See attachment B to <ref target="#d418">Document 418</ref>.</note> The President expressed general approval of the suggested approach but was doubtful about the advisability of distributing a specific paper even to the British since we would then have to give copies to the French and Germans, thus leading inevitably to publicity about alleged new Western offers.

<p>The President went on to say that tactically he felt the Western Powers should begin at Geneva by probing the Soviets to find out whether there had been any change in their position during the recess. We agreed that the Western Foreign Ministers could talk about the development of their position after they had reassembled in Geneva, thus avoiding possible leaks which would give the impression that the Western Powers were making concessions from the beginning of the resumed talks. With respect to the two blanks in the paper, the President agreed that these might be left for the Heads of Government to fill in at a Summit conference.</p>
<p>With respect to the type of arrangement to which we could finally agree, the President expressed the view that the cut-off point as to what we could accept would be what those people directly affected by the agreement might be willing themselves to accept, perhaps in a referendum.</p>

</list>
<p>In response to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName>’s inquiry, the Secretary said that Kozlov had nothing of particular interest to say this morning on the subject of Berlin.<note n="1" xml:id="d424fn1">See <ref target="#d422">Document 422</ref>.</note> He repeated his lines just as though he were a phonograph record; every one of the usual Soviet arguments was trotted out. At the White House<note n="2" xml:id="d424fn2">See <ref target="#d422fn6">footnote 6, Document 422</ref>.</note> he did emphasize that he could assure the President that the Soviets wanted to negotiate, not only on the subject of Berlin but on any other outstanding problems. Kozlov also led up to the possibility of the President’s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> after a discussion of their mutual interests in agriculture. There was no suggestion, however, of any specific meeting.</p>
<p>The Secretary went on to say that he had had an opportunity to talk with the President after his last meeting with <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d424fn3">See <ref target="#d419">Document 419</ref>.</note> While the President had in general approved the approach suggested, both he and the Secretary were doubtful about the advisability of distributing a specific paper. If it were given to the British, it would likewise have to be given to the French and Germans. This would almost inevitably lead to publicity about alleged new Western offers, which from a tactical point of view would be <hi rend="italic">highly</hi> undesirable. There was no objection to going over the substance of our thinking with <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName>, but we wanted to be able to say there was no paper in circulation. The Secretary reiterated the point that the Western Powers were handicapped at Geneva because of prior talk about fallback positions which the Soviets could not believe did not really exist.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said that his understanding of the situation was that the Soviets seemed to have given some indication of their fallSource: Department of State, Secretary’s Memoranda of Conversation: Lot 64 D199. Secret. Drafted by <persName corresp="#p_HMJ1">Hillenbrand</persName> and approved by <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> on July 7. <pb xml:id="pg_964" n="964" facs="0989"/>back position, and the task of the Western Powers now was to find out with some certainty what this was. As he understood it, the Secretary was suggesting that, tactically, the Western Powers should begin at Geneva by probing the Soviets. The Secretary agreed, and added that the Western Foreign Ministers could talk about the development of their position after they had reassembled in Geneva. This would help to avoid giving the impression through leaks that the Western Powers were making concessions right from the beginning.</p>
<p>The Secretary handed to <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> (for perusal but not retention) the paper which he had discussed with the President.<note n="4" xml:id="d424fn4">See attachment B to <ref target="#d418">Document 418</ref>.</note> He noted that there were two blanks in it which might be left for the heads of governments to fill in at a Summit Conference.</p>
<p>The Secretary commented that the President had introduced a new thought when he said that the type of arrangement we could agree to when dealing with people who were not our own was something which they themselves could accept. The cut-off point as to what we could accept would be what they themselves might be willing to accept, perhaps in a referendum.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> asked whether the United States draft communiqué precluded a turnover at the check points by the Soviets to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> officials. The Secretary indicated that this would probably not be a sticking point, but was not directly relevant to the proposal in question, since this envisaged a moratorium. The Secretary pointed out that, in his recent Moscow statement, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made no reference to civil access in Berlin.<note n="5" xml:id="d424fn5">For text of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement on June 28, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 349–360.</note> Any agreed position on access bringing this within the scope of a Four Power commission would be a net gain for the West. The present draft essentially contained only two new things: (a) substitution of a Four Power commission with German advisers for the all-German committee proposed by the Soviets and (b) introduction of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on a reciprocal basis for both sections of Berlin to monitor certain propaganda activities. Relative to the latter item the Secretary said he did not believe the Soviets could accept this, but the burden of responsibility for refusing it would be on them and this would be an advantage from our point of view. The most difficult aspect for us was acceptance of a time limit. This would require, of course, that at the end of the period negotiations would be within the framework of unimpaired Western rights.</p>
<p>The Secretary indicated that he was somewhat surprised to learn that the French, without consulting either the United States or the United Kingdom, had invited the Italians to a dinner party in Geneva on <pb xml:id="pg_965" n="965" facs="0990"/>July 12. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> could get there in time for dinner but no earlier. It would be up to <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> to take care of the other arrangements. The Belgian Minister Wigny was on the warpath. The Secretary pointed out that Luns was likewise certain to be irritated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that Luns would be in Geneva on July 12–13. The Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> agreed that the further arrangements for Sunday were essentially <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s responsibility.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said that he had received a message from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in response to a previous inquiry as to whether the British had any items they might wish Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to take up in Moscow later this month.<note n="6" xml:id="d424fn6">See <ref target="#d466">Document 466</ref>.</note> The Prime Minister had indicated that it seemed too early to make any specific suggestions, since these would be dependent on developments at Geneva. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> would, of course, be in touch with the Secretary, and if the British had anything to suggest, this presumably could be done at the last minute.</p>
<p>In response to a query, the Secretary confirmed that he planned to depart from Washington early on July 11, although his travel plans were still somewhat contingent on the type of plane which could actually be used. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> said he would like to see the Secretary once more before his departure for Geneva, but thought it would be better to limit his visits in order to avoid giving the impression that something was cooking.</p>

<item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, Assistant Secretary, <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss></item>
</list>
<p>[Here follow four paragraphs discussing unrelated subjects; for text, see volume X, Part 1, <ref target="#d81">Document 81</ref>.]</p>
<p>Kozlov then raised the question of Berlin and said that we were totally wrong in claiming that the Soviet Union wanted to annex West Berlin. I said that we had never claimed this but that we had pointed to <pb xml:id="pg_966" n="966" facs="0991"/><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s statement repeated by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the most logical and correct solution for West Berlin was for the East German regime to absorb it. He said that this was entirely true given the geographical facts but that statesmen cannot always achieve the most logical solution of a problem; they must in fact seek what is possible.</p>
<p>Kozlov then launched into a standard tirade on the folly of reunification which he said the British did not want, the French did not want and even <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> did not want. I told him that I thought he was incorrect in this but that in any event the United States would not cease to seek the reunification of Germany by peaceful means since we were satisfied that in the long run it would be disastrous for everyone if Germany were to be kept divided. I said that with a country located where Germany was with an industrious and nationally minded population, long-continued division would almost inevitably lead to irresponsible leadership. I said what really puzzled us was the failure of the Russians to understand our desire to see Germany reunited while moderate leadership was still available and when a reunified Germany could be established under such leadership on terms where it would never be a menace to any of its neighbors. I said that we, like the Russians, had fought two wars against Germany in my lifetime and that it was impossible for us to understand why the Soviets did not share our point of view on a point where it seemed that both our interests were identical.</p>
<p>Kozlov launched into a personal attack on <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>. I said that we could not accept such views and that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was not only a friend but we felt a wise statesman. He said, “I am warning you <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> will turn against you and if not <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> then his successor. You will recall this warning of mine of July 3.” I said he was wrong. He then said that a future West Germany might turn against the West just as Hitler had signed the pact with Stalin in 1939. He said that Russia had signed that pact because the United States and the West were seeking to direct Hitler against the Soviet Union and that the Soviet Union had taken the historically correct decision in the circumstances. I said that there had been no such desire or intention in the West and that in point of truth the Soviet pact with Hitler had been responsible for World War II because it gave Hitler the encouragement to attack France and the United Kingdom. He continued to argue the point and I finally said that I thought we could agree sooner on past history—even his version of the War of 1812—than we could on modern history. He said that he would remind me again of his “warning of July 3.”</p>
<p>At this point Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> came up and the plane was towed up for boarding.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_967" n="967" facs="0992"/>
<p>I said goodbye to Kozlov, wishing him a pleasant and an enlightening trip through our middle and far west. I said that we should continue our conversation at some point and that I thought it would last several days since he had not convinced me and obviously I had not convinced him.</p>
<p>The conversation was conducted throughout in good temper and Kozlov made a point of cordiality in saying goodbye.</p>

<p>55. For Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>. <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 2.<note n="1" xml:id="d426fn1">Telegram 2, July 1, asked <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> to seek West German views on the possibility of a four-power commission on Berlin with German advisers and for any further information the Embassy had on a proposal that Eckhardt made at the end of the first part of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Meeting. Presumably the proposal is that in <persName corresp="#p_EFV1">Eckardt</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Erinnerungen</hi>, pp. 580–582.</note> I saw Foreign Minister last night.</p>
<p>1. He said he had met with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> at Geneva on June 20. He had explained to them what limits were on German Government action regarding question raised first paragraph <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>. Neither he personally nor Federal government was prepared to agree to all-German commission as long as that commission does not have definite task assigned to it, that is, something within stipulations Western Peace Plan.</p>
<p>2. He had gone on to tell his British and French colleagues that he could imagine one could revert to some of the ideas suggested by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> during preparations for the conference. These envisaged establishment of a 4-power commission to consider problems connected with reunification of Germany. There would be no objection to German experts being called in in advisory capacity, provided they would have no executive or legislative powers, and further provided their functions were clearly defined by the 4-power commission so that they would act merely as an auxiliary to that commission. In such case, said the Foreign Minister, no question of parity between two Germanies <pb xml:id="pg_968" n="968" facs="0993"/>would arise, since it would not be an autonomous organization. Hence, the number of experts would not matter.</p>
<p>3. On July 3 Foreign Minister had discussed above with <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGF1">Duckwitz</persName> and will take it up today with Chancellor. Thereafter, he will inform the Allies of the German position in this respect, if possible before the Geneva Conference reconvenes. However, he is not certain he can meet this deadline.</p>
<p>4. Re second paragraph <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, Foreign Minister said in last days of conference, <persName corresp="#p_EFV1">von Eckardt</persName> had submitted a paper on his personal initiative, to the German delegation. Foreign Minister had not been in agreement with some of his ideas, but is continuing to consider his proposals. He said he was unhappy that an informal private paper submitted by a non-member of the Foreign Office had been brought to the Allies’ attention. I told him, in defense of <persName corresp="#p_EFV1">von Eckardt</persName>, that this Embassy had no copy of the proposal, nor did I believe the Department had ever received one. Additionally, I said I had recently mentioned the matter myself to <persName corresp="#p_EFV1">von Eckardt</persName>, who answered that the paper was purely a representation of his private views.</p>
<p>5. I did not tell Foreign Minister that two days ago <persName corresp="#p_EFV1">von Eckardt</persName> had said to me he intended to renew his suggestions to the Chancellor and Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>6. I think at this point it would be mistake for Department to mention <persName corresp="#p_EFV1">von Eckardt</persName>’s proposals. He will have more of them and some of them may be worth consideration, but only if they are put forward with approval of Foreign Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> and I met with the Secretary today to review questions connected with Berlin contingency planning. The following are the principal points discussed and decided:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_969" n="969" facs="0994"/>
<p>1. The Secretary reviewed his conversation with British Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> in Geneva last month<note n="1" xml:id="d427fn1">See <ref target="#d411">Document 411</ref>.</note> which had led the British to believe that there was some change in the U.S. position on the question of access identification and checkpoint procedures as worked out by the Embassies in Bonn. Specifically, that we might be prepared to reconsider the acceptability of East German stamping. The Secretary made it clear that he had been talking with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> not within the framework of the contingency planning at all but within the context of a possible arrangement with the Soviets which would retain responsibility and amount to an agency relationship between the Soviets and the East Germans. The Secretary authorized us to take the necessary action to clear up the British misunderstanding on this point.</p>
<p>2. We discussed the question of the planning with respect to possible recourse to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the event of the breakdown of negotiations and unilateral action on the part of the Soviets. The Secretary confirmed his agreement with the procedures contemplated in the contingency planning paper on this subject.</p>
<p>3. We discussed with the Secretary preparatory and precautionary military measures which had been taken under the President’s authorization to undertake such measures “of a kind which will not create public alarm but which will be detectable by Soviet intelligence.” We said that we feared that the measures taken so far had been relatively innocuous and had not made a measurable impression on the Soviets. We accordingly raised the question as to whether the President’s authorization should not be sought to move into a more advanced phase of preparatory measures of a kind which might cause a certain amount of public uneasiness, short however of creating an atmosphere of crisis. We were not ready to suggest specific measures but if the President approved in principle, we would work these out together with the Pentagon and in consultation with the British and French. The Secretary agreed with this proposal and asked that a paper be prepared for him for the purpose of discussing the question with the President on the following day after the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Reduction of the Berlin Garrison</item>
</list>
<p>1. At a meeting of the Coordinating Group, Berlin Contingency Planning, on 22 June 1959,<note n="1" xml:id="d428fn1">No record of this meeting has been found.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, Under Secretary of State, indicated that Allied force ceilings in Berlin should be examined as an area by which the United States might induce a concession by the USSR which would justify a summit meeting.</p>
<p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that a minor “symbolic” reduction of the Allied Berlin garrison would not significantly affect the capability of the force to retard Soviet Bloc aggression. However, even such a “minor” reduction would be morally and psychologically damaging to Allied interests. Furthermore, the current site and composition of the garrison have been carefully tailored to the mission assigned and cannot be reduced without a commensurate readjustment of mission responsibilities. Any significant reduction of the forces in Berlin would compel the Joint Chiefs of Staff to consider the evacuation of U.S. dependents from Berlin because their protection during Communist fomented civil disturbances could no longer be insured.</p>
<p>3. In a full-scale military engagement the Soviet Bloc forces, vastly superior in numbers, could overwhelm the Allied garrison forces. On the other hand, the garrison forces, in conjunction with the West Berlin police, could resist Soviet aggression long enough to capture free world attention and to facilitate Allied decision on the implementation of forceful counteraction, including the substantial use of military force and, if necessary, preparatory measures for general war.</p>
<p>4. Another danger in formally agreeing with the Soviets upon any restriction or reduction in the size of our Berlin garrison is that the Soviets thereafter will undoubtedly use such agreement to impose further controls and harassments upon the exercise of Allied rights in Berlin. This would probably result in Soviet insistence upon their right to insure through detailed checks at their control points that the Allies were not exceeding the numbers and types of U.S. military personnel agreed for the Berlin garrison.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_971" n="971" facs="0996"/>
<p>5. In view of the foregoing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the following views be transmitted to the Secretary of State:</p>
<list>
<item>a. A reduction of the Allied Berlin garrison should not be effected as long as East Germany remains under Communist domination.</item>
<item>b. A reduction of the Allied Berlin garrison should not be tendered as a concession to the Soviet Union in the current (recessed) Geneva discussion.</item>

<head>OTHERS PRESENT</head>
<item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName></item>
<item>General <persName corresp="#p_GBGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName></item>
</list>
<p>Mr.<persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> came in to see the President to discuss with him his outlook toward the negotiations resuming in Geneva on July 13th. He said he proposed to probe the Soviets immediately on one item to which they have shown some sensitivity. He recalled that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at once responded at length after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> had referred to the two-year deadline as an ultimatum, including that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> had misinterpreted the nature of the Soviet proposal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that if the Soviets are willing to leave the matter that allied rights will not be terminated at the end of such a period, even though they do not formally recognize allied rights, he thought there was a basis for negotiation.</p>
<p>The President said that it must be clear that our rights stand until we adopt some more acceptable arrangements. In the meantime, we could cut our forces in West Berlin, agree that neither side would interfere with economic activities, cut down on propaganda from both sides, etc. In the meantime we would undertake to confer with our associates to see what further steps might be instituted.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_972" n="972" facs="0997"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he thought that, if negotiation seems to move satisfactorily, the two items of the length of any agreement and the total number of troops to remain in West Berlin might be left blank, for determination at a summit meeting. He said that State is now thinking that a summit meeting on honorable terms is desirable.</p>
<p>The President referred to a phone call he had made to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>. He said what he is thinking of is suggesting to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that he visit the Russian exhibit in New York and spend a day or two here in Washington. The President would then visit the U.S. exhibit in Moscow and have a day or two’s talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Really what he would have in mind saying is that we would like to negotiate improved arrangements and relationships but we could not ever do so with a gun pointed at our head. He would recall that the United States and the USSR had won the war together and had jointly taken on obligations thereafter. Under our obligations, we cannot and will not abandon two million West Berliners or the West Germans.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he saw reason for such a course of action. Although the public around the world does not seem much concerned, it is evident that in the “chanceries” a feeling of tension and uneasiness is arising. A conversation between the President and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would do no harm and might do some good. The key point is to find a way of doing it without appearing to be kowtowing or weakening. Timing will have to be very carefully studied.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> next referred to the nuclear test talks. These are at a difficult point. The Soviets are insisting upon the acceptance of the principle of quota, leaving the exact number to be haggled over as a political question. It is clear, and becoming clearer, that inspection against underground tests is a very uncertain and expensive operation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJA1">McCone</persName> and many others would much rather start with a ban of atmospheric tests only. He added that the inspection systems being discussed would be very costly and of doubtful efficacy. Within the State Department there is division of opinion regarding the continuation of the talks. He thought there was a consensus, however, that they should not be broken off. We then come to the question, “how long should they be allowed to drag on?” He said the British are so anxious for an agreement that they would sign almost anything.</p>
<p>The President reverted to the question of a talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He indicated he was prepared to say he was ready to negotiate on any subject, but had to make it very clear that we would not let down our friends. He commented that the creation of the feeling that these issues can only be decided at summit meetings plays into the Soviet hands, since they can exploit the flexibility available to a dictator.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he would be leaving on Saturday, and would of course stay in very close touch with the President. The President said he <pb xml:id="pg_973" n="973" facs="0998"/>thought there had been complete success between himself and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> in exchanging views during the earlier session so that each knew the thinking of the other. He said he tries to avoid holding press conferences at times when they could embarrass Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s negotiation. In addition, he strives to make clear that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> has real authority to negotiate.</p>
<p>With regard to the summit meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said there are two related questions to be considered. One is the timing of the possible visit with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The second is a meeting of the President with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. Regarding the latter, diplomatic channels have just about been exhausted in doing anything constructive.</p>
<p>The President said that the itinerary he was thinking of would be Paris (where he could see <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>), Moscow, Karachi, New Delhi, perhaps Japan, and then home. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he understood that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be invited here on an informal basis. The President confirmed this, stating that the meeting would be without agenda and without communiqué, unless they happened to come to some agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said there is a feeling worldwide that no one in the world other than President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would have so much influence on the situation, and this would seem to be an effective plan to bring that influence to bear.</p>
<p>The President said he would like to see some study as to the sequence of events. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that the British are very anxious to have the summit meeting before the election—which seems to mean late August or early September for the summit meeting. He doesn’t fully understand this, since it would seem that a promise of holding a summit meeting shortly after the election might in fact be much better than one which turned out to be inconclusive. The President said he could go to Moscow about the first of August, and then to the summit about the first of September. He would be in Moscow about a week after the Vice President under this plan. In any case, the President said <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could be told that if he were to come over here for two or three days, the President would return the visit some time later in the year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said there might be a good possibility of having the summit meeting in Quebec, with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> coming to the United States a day or two in advance. The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> to think about the matter and visit him in the Mansion late in the afternoon on Friday if he came up with any ideas.</p>

<p>49. Paris for Embassy, <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CINCEUR1">CINCEUR</gloss> <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> &amp; West. In informal meeting with Commandants this afternoon, Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> made following points re Geneva:</p>
<p>He thought there possibility <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s might accept Western paper of June 16<note n="1" xml:id="d430fn1">See <ref target="#d411fn1">footnote 1, Document 411</ref>.</note> as basis for discussion and would then offer “improvements” interpreting Western proposals in <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> sense. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> thought in that case it necessary for Western powers be prepared immediately counteract <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss> proposals by tabling interpretations of their own.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>’s thoughts on Western plan being sent to Bonn on <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName>’s request. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> most concerned with points relating to access and curbing of activities against public order mentioned in Western paper. Re access, he not satisfied with words “wie bisher” used in formulating demand for continued free and unrestricted access in German version of Western paper. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said “wie bisher” might conceivably also include blockade period.</p>
<p>Re curbing of certain activities, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said that phrase “measures should be taken consistent with fundamental rights and liberties” likely lead to interminable wrangling between East and West since Communist interpretation of what constituted fundamental human rights quite different from Western. West Berlin newspaper article criticizing USSR might be considered by <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s as violation of Berlin agreement. Senator Lipschitz had suggested language specifying that activities which violate recognized penal codes in both parts of Germany be curbed, but <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> not entirely satisfied with this definition either.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> felt perhaps most dangerous point of Western proposal related to limiting Western troop strength but he refraining from commenting formally on this point since not within his competence. Expressing his personal opinion he certain any commitment which would give <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s an opportunity introduce controls over Allied troop strength would be dangerous. Should West Berlin be exposed to concerted infiltration attempt by Communists, Allied troop levels would make a real difference because West Berlin police morale would be affected if Allied garrisons reduced to a point where police recognize Allied troops could no longer be effective in supporting police action.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_975" n="975" facs="1000"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> expressed personal belief that minor Allied troop reduction would not be considered by <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s as meaningful concession and would gain us nothing. Serious reduction would call into question concept “trip wire mechanism.” Handful of Allied troops might simply be “arrested” without being able offer meaningful resistence in which case it could not be clearly established that act of aggression had been committed.</p>
<p>In reply to question from British Commandant whether troop reduction would affect morale of West Berlin population as a whole, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said there was danger it would be regarded as first step toward Allied evacuation and could therefore have strongly negative effect on Berlin morale.</p>
<p>In reply to another question from British Commandant as to whether Allied force reduction of 2 to 3,000 could be compensated for by increase in West Berlin police, <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said two issues not directly related. If people were afraid that Allied policy over long run was to evacuate Berlin, police reinforcements would do nothing to dispel such fears; in addition, decline in police morale occasioned by troop reductions might offset increasing police numbers. Reinforcing police should be considered in any event.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> repeated to Commandants his dissatisfaction with <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>’s failure to keep him informed of Geneva developments, either through von Mettenheim at Geneva or through <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> Bonn. He had discussed this matter last Monday with Chancellor and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> and they had agreed to rectify situation. <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> told Commandants he hoped they would support with other governments the inclusion of Berlin’s representative at Geneva as a technical adviser to any working group which might be concerned with formulation of proposals directly affecting Berlin. (Presumably <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> has indicated to <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> it willing to make such proposal.) <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> felt such technical advice would be of great benefit.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> said he or Senator <persName corresp="#p_KG1">Klein</persName> prepared to go to Geneva at any time if their views or advice on technical points might be deemed helpful. Added that commencing July 21 he would be vacationing near Munich and could get to Geneva on a few hours notice.</p>

<item>Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_GBGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName></item>
</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> began by saying that the group had considered very carefully the President’s idea of talking with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and thought that this was a very worthwhile thing to do. To this end they suggested that the President send word very confidentially to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, through Kozlov who is leaving in the next day or two, that if there are results at Geneva sufficient to justify a summit meeting, he would propose that it be held in Quebec and that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> come down to the United States for a few days in advance, seeing the President at Camp David. The President would then plan to go to Moscow in October and on to India. The idea would be for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> to see Kozlov very quietly in New York on Sunday to put this matter to him.</p>
<p>The President said if he went to Moscow at that time he would have to skip Western Europe since if he stopped in one place he would have to stop in many. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he and his associates also thought there would be value in the President going to Paris for about two days just ahead of the summit meeting to hold a “Western Summit” and have one day of conversations with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>.</p>
<p>The President commented that one reason he had thought of having <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> over within the next couple of weeks was that this might do some good at the Geneva sessions which are being resumed on the thirteenth. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he and his associates felt that sending the message now to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would have much the same effect. One reason he is taking advantage of Kozlov’s return is that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is planning to go to Poland early next week with attendant possibility that he might make provocative public statements there.</p>
<p>The President then considered a draft of a letter to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and a draft of a “talking paper” which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> would use.<note n="1" xml:id="d431fn1">Neither of these drafts has been found, but see footnote 3 below.</note> He suggested changes to make it clear that this is not a pressure tactic on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He also suggested as a reason for Quebec as a site the problem he may face in late August or early September arising from the windup of the Congressional session.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> asked what the President would think about telling the British and the French of this, and specifically about mentioning it to <pb xml:id="pg_977" n="977" facs="1002"/><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName>. The President thought that he should go no further than to say that we are discreetly inquiring whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would like to make an exchange of informal visits. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said he would like to broach the idea of Quebec to the British and the French, since they will be studying the summit problem.</p>
<p>The President said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> might mention the possibility of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visiting a few other places in the United States—such as the agricultural station at Beltsville and other points of interesting economic activity.</p>
<p>The President next referred to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s meeting with <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d431fn2">See <ref target="#d417">Documents 417</ref> and <ref target="#d420">420</ref>.</note> and his comment that there is going to be trouble if the Western allies do not leave Berlin and that he would say the same thing to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> when he met him. The President said a meeting of himself with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be useful for one thing. If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> were to threaten war or use of force, he would immediately call his bluff and ask him to agree on a day to start. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> felt that such a direct answer would be most useful in our dealing with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, who seems to have, or to be trying to create, the impression that we will not stand up to him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> had given him in utmost confidence his impression that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is quite uncertain as to the effectiveness of the ICBMs. While he seemed to be quite confident of Soviet ability to devastate Western Europe, his attitude on longer range weapons was quite different.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> said it would have to be made clear that this is not a social or ceremonial visit but is a business trip for the purpose of informal discussions. The President agreed with this but recalled that the Russians are great ones for ostentation and formal display at social dinners, etc.</p>
<p>It was agreed that the State Department group would revise the documents along the lines suggested by the President and send them over to him Saturday morning.<note n="3" xml:id="d431fn3">Copies of the revised draft letter and the amended talking paper were transmitted to the President on Saturday, July 11.

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 298. Paris pass <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss>. At <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s dinner for <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> last night little of great importance emerged. Other guests were <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, all Ministers with two advisers. I had <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> with me. <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> with bulging briefcase took post-prandial working meeting seriously.</p>
<p>As this was first opportunity for me to see other conference participants we spent some time on tactics for opening session today.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> following general lines German tactics paper<note n="1" xml:id="d433fn1">Translations of the three West German papers, “Tactics at the Opening of the Second Phase” “Tactics for the Event of a Renewed Failure of Negotiations,” and “The Negotiation Situation Following the Conclusion of the First Phase of the Conference,” were transmitted to Geneva in airgram G–01, July 11. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 396.1–GE/7–1159)</note> made available Dept just prior my departure strongly urged Western Ministers return to problem of Germany as a whole and disarmament rather than pick up Berlin where we left. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> objected and I supported him.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_979" n="979" facs="1004"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then raised what he termed defect in our June 16 Berlin proposal which was absence any provision for dealing on continuing basis with problem of Germany as a whole. He asked tentatively what his colleagues would think of embellishing our memorandum with proposed establishment four-power commission with German Delegations attached. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> objected on grounds this would play into Soviet hands by adding to stature <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and embarrassing <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. I disagreed with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and urged we consider <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s suggestion seriously.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> then took over conversation for prolonged period. He opened with plea for more formal and enduring association of Italy with conference and its staff work. In this connection he referred to importance Italy’s position in Alliance particularly with respect to atomic risks to which it was now exposed. He indicated Italy while pessimistic over prospects for sufficient present progress to justify summit was nevertheless anxious one be held. He referred to fragile character Italian public opinion and narrow parliamentary margin on which government operates. He then proposed some new dramatic solution for Berlin and unveiled a proposal that occupying powers turn West Berlin over to <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> retaining temporarily their forces in city under invitation from Senat pending <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> ruling on legality transfer of sovereignty. He promised to submit detailed memorandum on this proposal and expressed fervent hope opportunity for prolonged consideration of it with his colleagues in days ahead.</p>
<p>None of us commented substantively as hour was growing extremely late but I suspect <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> with <persName corresp="#p_SCA1">Straneo</persName> and Pansa who attended him are settling down for once.</p>
<p>During course general conversation prior <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pella</persName> discourse <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> described in classically British form essentiality summit irrespective result of this conference. I agreed with some of his argumentation but pointed out our task was to insure achievement sufficient progress to justify it. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> somewhat to my surprise and in contrast pre-recess attitude agreed we should search for minimum agreement with Soviets which would warrant summit and said interim solution on Berlin seemed obvious arrangement to attain this purpose. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> interjected no objection this trend of thought at this point.</p>
<p>Just before break-up <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> informed colleagues he had torn up proposed reply to Soviets on Balkan atom free zone<note n="2" xml:id="d433fn2">For text of the Soviet proposal of June 25 on a nuclear-free Balkan and Adriatic zone and the U.S. rejection of the proposal, see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1945–1959</hi>, vol.

<pb xml:id="pg_980" n="980" facs="1005"/>
<p>He said he took more forthcoming position to effect regional zone of character proposed by Soviets made no sense except in larger context global disarmament measures safeguarded by adequate inspection system. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> also said UK had received no assurances from Soviets during recess as some press reports indicated.</p>
<p>We agreed Deputies’ Coordinating Group would meet early this morning and Western Foreign Ministers at noon.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 301. At meeting of Western Foreign Ministers this morning, after agreeing procedure to be followed in today’s plenary session, following topics which had been raised in coordinating group<note n="1" xml:id="d434fn1">A record of the Coordinating Group meeting at 10:30 a.m., US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/116, is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1341.</note> were discussed by Ministers: (1) German proposal to admit Poles and Czechs to conference to set stage for <gloss target="#t_GFR1">GFR</gloss> unilateral declaration or possible offer of non-aggression pact to those two countries; (2) German suggestion that Western powers propose creation of four-power commission, to which German experts could be attached, to study problems East-West contacts, reunification and peace treaty during interim of temporary agreement on Berlin.</p>
<p>Although US, UK and French <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s agreed that idea of <gloss target="#t_GFR1">GFR</gloss> offer of non-aggression pact to Poland and Czechoslovakia was interesting and merited study, they were unanimous in their view that Poles and Czechs should not be admitted to conference for reasons advanced at beginning of conference and which were still valid. Furthermore they agreed that Geneva conference was not best forum for such a proposal if eventually made by <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. In these circumstances <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said he would not insist on his suggestion but would circulate to Ministers German draft declaration<note n="2" xml:id="d434fn2">Not found.</note> which he hoped they would study.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_981" n="981" facs="1006"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> then urged German point of view as set forth in their working paper (entitled “Western tactics during second phase of conference” available in Department)<note n="3" xml:id="d434fn3">Regarding the three draft West German papers, see <ref target="#d433fn1">footnote 1, Document 433</ref>.</note> that in reconvened conference Western FonMins should put primary emphasis on overall German questions and referred to German proposal for four-power commission. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> described his strong objection to proposal first because it created link between Berlin problem and that of Germany as a whole, and secondly because it would create what would in effect be a permanent body which afforded Russians means to interfere in internal affairs of Federal Republic. This would facilitate Soviet objectives of strengthening <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and weakening <gloss target="#t_GFR1">GFR</gloss>. Thirdly he saw danger in having identical terminal date for Interim agreement on Berlin and work of four-power commission. This would provide Soviets with convenient leverage to create crisis and pressure on Berlin problem.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> replied linkage was originally Western not Soviet idea. The object was to insure that discussions of German question would continue.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> contended that Western powers did not establish link but had said that they would not accept any change in status of Berlin outside process of reunification. He considered it dangerous now to accept link which made it implicit that status of Berlin would change without reunification.</p>
<p>Secretary observed that <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s position posed serious problem since he and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> viewed German proposal favorably. Furthermore, he understood <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had some suggestion how Berlin problem and all-German issue could be separated.</p>
<p>Accordingly he proposed that Ministers formulate their views over night and meet July 14 at 10:30 a.m. in effort to resolve issue. This was agreed.</p>
<p>Agreement was reached to seek private meeting July 14 at plenary today. General approval was also expressed of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s suggestion that probe of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s position (with particular reference to his June 28 statement<note n="4" xml:id="d434fn4">For text of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 349–360.</note> re status Allied rights at expiry any period agreed for temporary Berlin agreement) could be conducted without accepting Soviet proposal of June 19<note n="5" xml:id="d434fn5">See <ref target="#d415fn4">footnote 4, Document 415</ref>.</note> as basis for discussion by comparing subject by subject its points common with those of Western proposal of June 16.<note n="6" xml:id="d434fn6">See <ref target="#d411fn1">footnote 1, Document 411</ref>.</note></p>

<p>[Here follow paragraphs 1–3 in which <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> reviewed unrelated subjects.]</p>
<p>4. I then indicated to the President that I wished to discuss three matters which involved Berlin, and to some extent, the Foreign Ministers conference in Geneva.</p>
<p>The first related to the level of troops in Berlin and his request that a study be made of what the number might appropriately be. I indicated that I had levied a request on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and the answer had not been forthcoming, largely because he had difficulty getting a coordinated Defense view. I reported to the President that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had just completed a review and were opposed to any reduction. However, it appeared that Defense was taking a less obdurate view and that I hoped within a few days there would be an answer for him.</p>
<p>I also reported that I was informed that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> and the military in Washington were concerned about a limitation without <pb xml:id="pg_984" n="984" facs="1009"/>inspection and verification as a precedent which might be bothersome in later and broader disarmament negotiations. The President indicated that he did not have in mind that there would be any limitation but if there were to be a reduction it would be unilateral and not necessarily permanent.</p>
<p>The second problem concerned the inadequate results in tripartite planning for surface access to Berlin. I reported to the President that in the tripartite planning the UK had, in a sense, taken over, asserting the position that if the initial probe fails this would necessarily mean an allout nuclear war, if the Berlin position is to be maintained. They tended to ignore the intermediate steps contemplated in the planning position put forward by the US. This appears to be an effort to force a Summit meeting. The President said that this coincided with the message he had had from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d436fn1"><ref target="#d416">Document 416</ref>.</note> and seemed to be a part of the pattern.</p>
<p>I reported to the President that as late as July 10 in a tripartite meeting,<note n="2" xml:id="d436fn2">No further record of this meeting has been found.</note> the UK was not willing to give government approval to the planning paper although at civilian and military staff levels it had been agreed to. The question largely hinges around how much we would let the East Germans operate. The UK is prepared to go much further than our agency concept. As justification for the UK position, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> cited a conversation between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> in Geneva,<note n="3" xml:id="d436fn3">See <ref target="#d410">Documents 410</ref> and <ref target="#d411">411</ref>.</note> in which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> maintained Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s views did not coincide with the planning documents.</p>
<p>I expressed to the President my view that this was a matter of the most serious implications. He agreed and asked me to request Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> to present a summary of this situation at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on July 16.</p>
<p>The third item had to do with the Department of Defense’s concern that the State Department was materially weakening the US position with respect to Berlin. I indicated to the President that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had concluded that our negotiating position, from a military point of view, would be stronger now than two and half years from now, and that this was also the conclusion of an ad hoc committee consisting of State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. The President found this hard to believe. In any event, I pointed out to him that on the basis of a State Department paper,<note n="4" xml:id="d436fn4">Not identified further.</note> which had been made available to Defense, Defense felt against the background at this time, the State Department was proposing a two and a half year moratorium with respect to Berlin; or alternatively, <pb xml:id="pg_985" n="985" facs="1010"/>proposing a “guaranteed free city” or a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship for Berlin. Either of the latter courses was felt by Defense to demonstrate a retreat by the US. I pointed out to the President that this matter had been brought to my attention on Saturday afternoon by the Defense Department and they were somewhat concerned that there was a Presidentially approved paper which they had not been privileged to see. I told the President that I had discussed this with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and that he felt that Defense was unduly excited and if they fully understood the situation, their cause for concern would disappear. The President then asked me who really was raising the issue and I pointed out that it was Defense. He commented that negotiations with respect to Berlin were primarily a State Department matter and that for purposes of this sort Defense was not a policy-making body but an operating body. I responded that I nevertheless felt it my duty to bring to his attention major differences of view in matters of such supreme importance.</p>
<p>He then summoned Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_WAC1">Whitman</persName> and asked her if she had a copy of the “talking paper” which he had approved for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s use in the resumed conferences.<note n="5" xml:id="d436fn5">Presumably the President is referring to the draft communiqué; see attachment B to <ref target="#d418">Document 418</ref>.</note> She did not have such a copy but the President told me that it contained a number of positions which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> felt he might be forced to take if there were to be any progress at all towards a basis for a Summit meeting.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 311. Western Foreign Ministers met this morning and again this afternoon. They agreed:</p>
<p>1. Not to pursue <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> regarding private meeting but to have plenary sessions tomorrow and Thursday. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, who is having <pb xml:id="pg_986" n="986" facs="1011"/><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to lunch on Friday, offered to convert luncheon into private session if developments should make this desirable.</p>
<p>2. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> to make principal speech at tomorrow’s plenary session directed at questioning <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on Soviet all-German committee proposal, analysis of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s July 13 speech<note n="1" xml:id="d437fn1">See <ref target="#d435fn3">footnote 3, Document 435</ref>.</note> and emphasis on Western Peace Plan.</p>
<p>3. Coordinating group will meet tomorrow morning. Large part of discussion turned around <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s concern that if West discussed Berlin question and all-German committee proposal together as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wished, we should be negotiating both issues under Berlin threat and run risk of having to make concessions on both counts. In his view Russians should be told that West prepared discuss both questions, but not together, and that if Berlin question resolved then discussion of all-German committee could be taken up. He thought that if West wanted to go to summit meeting having removed Berlin threat then it must accept time limit on interim Berlin arrangement. There was, however, no reason and it would be highly dangerous to accept concurrent time limit in respect to broader German questions which would then be broughtas well under Berlin threat. This would provide Russians with convenient lever with which to interfere in Western Germany. Although Ministers reached no definitive decision on this question of tactics which will be dealt with further, discussion revealed large measure of agreement with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s analysis.</p>
<p>At outset of meeting at <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s suggestion British Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSP1">Reilly</persName> reported on his talk in Moscow with <persName corresp="#p_KVV1">Kuznetsov</persName>, which was described in today’s <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_NYT1">NYT</gloss></hi>.

<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> was visibly upset at leaks in French press of German working paper and report that full text would appear in tomorrow’s <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_NYT1">NYT</gloss></hi>.<note n="2" xml:id="d437fn2">See <ref target="#d433fn1">footnote 1, Document 433</ref>.</note> He had been queried by <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> in this connection. He requested his colleagues to return the copies that had been provided him so he could assert the paper did not exist and made impassioned plea for greater security saying he was conducting investigation in his own delegation.</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>As you will have gathered, we are off to a very slow start. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s opening speech added nothing and his balking at informal meetings without the presence of the East Germans is likely to slow things down. I have had two good sessions with the Western Foreign Ministers<note n="1" xml:id="d438fn1">See <ref target="#d437">Document 437</ref>.</note> which, while they indicated considerable divergence of views at the beginning, ended with complete agreement since divergence was on tactics rather than principle.</p>
<p>The general feeling here, including <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>, is that a summit conference some time this fall is inevitable. I wish I could be as optimistic that we will have achieved sufficient progress to allow such a meeting to be held in reasonable atmosphere. I will keep right on plugging.</p>

<p>On July 15 President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> replied to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s message of July 14 as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>“I am interested in your observation about the general feeling at Geneva, to the effect that a Summit Conference some time this fall is inevitable. The existence of such a feeling must mean that our Allies are convinced that there will be sufficient progress at Geneva to justify such a meeting on the part of the Western Powers. Unless they do have this confidence in some progress, then they must be assuming that the West will surrender to pressure from the other side.</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_988" n="988" facs="1013"/>
<item>“You and I have long ago agreed that we have no idea of being either belligerent or unnecessarily rigid. But we have stood and intend to stand on principle. Moreover, we have made it abundantly clear that we are ready to interpret progress at Geneva in a liberal manner. It would be most unfortunate if our associates should assume that regardless of the absence of progress, this government will consent to attend a Summit Conference. For us this would be such an unacceptable retreat that it would virtually spell surrender. This we will not do. (Department of State, Central Files, 110.11–HE/7–1559)</item>

<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied with series of questions directed to why West had not given concrete answers to latest Soviet proposals on all German <pb xml:id="pg_989" n="989" facs="1014"/>committee and provisional status of Berlin in view of fact West had first suggested all German committee and fact proposal met previously expressed Western concern. Added <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s statement had not clarified situation.</p>
<p>Secretary stated <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should reply to <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s questions as Soviet had introduced all German committee into Berlin discussion.

<p>A. Chancellor’s chief concern seemed possibility Western disunity due appeasing tactics British.

<p>1. After a discussion of reports about <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s health, it was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> would ask British Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSP1">Reilly</persName> his impressions/Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSP1">Reilly</persName>, who is now in Geneva, had apparently seen <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on July 9.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Conference Tactics</p>
<p>2. With regard to today’s plenary session, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that we must not overlook the fact that these are primarily propaganda operations. He suggested that the Secretary attack the All-German Commission concept of the Soviets and recapitulate the Western Peace Plan more thoroughly than <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> had done yesterday. He might highlight the basic differences between the Western Peace Plan and the Soviet All-German proposal. The Secretary said that he did not want to focus on the Soviet plan, and pointed out that we had not yet discussed our plan for a four-power commission with German advisors. He thought today might be a good time to introduce the proposal to have the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> monitor propaganda activities in Berlin, emphasizing the reciprocal aspect of this proposal. There appears to be an impression that we are making a unilateral concession in this regard and we should correct this impression. The Secretary noted that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> wanted to go even further than we did as he wished to have the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> police the access routes to Berlin. The Secretary said that he was convinced that Hammarskjold would not accept the proposal since it would involve executive responsibility for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which Hammarskjold does not want. After further discussion it was agreed:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_992" n="992" facs="1017"/>

<item>1) that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> would undertake to prepare a speech for the Secretary in which the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> proposal would be the principal part;</item>
<item>2) our allies would be asked in the coordinating committee this morning to agree to this type of speech; and</item>
<item>3) provided allied agreement is obtained, Hammarskjold would be notified prior to the Secretary’s speech of the intention to mention the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> monitoring proposal.</item>

<p rend="sectiontitleital"><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> Optimistic</p>
<p>3.

<p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> confirmed that the Secretary’s speech at the American Club of Geneva today would be informal and would not deal with any matter of policy.

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Meeting of the Coordinating Group</item>
</list>
<p>The following were the principal points made at today’s meeting of the Coordinating Group:</p>
<p>1. At today’s plenary meeting, after <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has been given an opportunity to speak, the Secretary will make a statement re-presenting and analyzing the Western proposal on Berlin of June 16.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that the Secretary hoped during his presentation to be able to raise the possibility of requesting the Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to provide a representative to report on propaganda activities. The views of the other delegations were requested on an urgent basis so that Hammarskjold could be told before this afternoon’s session, as a matter of courtesy, that the Secretary was going to raise this possibility. The British indicated on the spot that they were agreeable. Both <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> said they would have to consult with their Foreign Ministers before giving an answer.</p>
<p>2. If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> chooses to speak at the outset of the meeting and, as seems indicated, again stresses the importance of the All-German <pb xml:id="pg_994" n="994" facs="1019"/>Committee, the Secretary would open his remarks by stating that he felt this subject had been disposed of by the Western Foreign Ministers yesterday, but that some of his colleagues might have some further comments to make. He himself preferred to go ahead along the lines which he had indicated as desirable in his closing remarks yesterday. If it seemed desirable, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> would then follow with a further rebuttal of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement.</p>
<p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> indicated that he likewise had a short statement prepared rebutting the Soviet position on the All-German Committee which could be used if it seemed desirable.</p>
<p>4. The French distributed the final version of the semiweekly report<note n="1" xml:id="d443fn1">Transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 346 from Geneva, July 17. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 396.1–GE/7–1759)</note> to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> on developments at Geneva, but there was no discussion of the text. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> indicated that the American Delegation, whose turn to prepare the report came next, would complete its report on Friday to include the proceedings of that day. This could then be distributed to the Council in Paris on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had invited the Secretary either for dinner on Friday or lunch on Saturday, with or without his wife, with or without aides, and with or without their wives. The Secretary was indicating to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that he would accept for lunch on Saturday for himself and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> alone.</p>
<p>6. At the request of the British press officer, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPF1">Hancock</persName> stated that British journalists were becoming increasingly unhappy, particularly in view of the length of the meetings so far, about the procedure being followed at the Maison de la Presse for distribution of texts of speeches. Under quadripartite agreement such texts were only distributed at the conclusion of the Plenary Sessions each day. The Russians had been cheating in that they were releasing the texts of speeches immediately after their delivery in Moscow but had observed the agreement here in Geneva. In any event, representatives of British papers were finding that they could not meet their late afternoon deadlines tinder the present system. They therefore requested that the necessary arrangements be made so that speeches could be released immediately after delivery at the Plenary Sessions. The French Press Officer, who was present at the meeting, said that some journalists had actually requested that the Plenary Sessions be moved up to 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon and he believed the Russians would favor such an advance of the meeting time. After further discussion in the Coordinating Group, it was agreed that the Western press officers should approach the Soviets noting the unsatisfactory state of affairs under the present system for Western <pb xml:id="pg_995" n="995" facs="1020"/>correspondents and suggesting that agreement be reached so that speeches could be released immediately after delivery. In this connection, consideration might be given to pointing out to the Soviets that their present practice was to release <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statements in Moscow immediately after delivery here. If the Soviets should not agree to this proposal, but suggest that the meetings be advanced to 3:00 p.m., this would be a question which would have to be decided by the Western Ministers.</p>
<p>7. There were three reports given of recent conversations with Soviet officials: (a) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSP1">Reilly</persName>, who had dined with <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> yesterday evening, indicated they had had a long and discursive discussion. <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName>’s attitude was one of discouragement and pessimism. He particularly complained about the sharpness of the exchanges yesterday afternoon between <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSP1">Reilly</persName> told him that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s speech of July 13 had seemed to imply a stiffening of the Soviet position. <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> was particularly firm on the subject of the All-German Committee and its necessary link to any temporary arrangement which might be agreed for Berlin. In effect, he said that if the Western Powers could not accept the All-German Committee, then there could be no agreement reached in Geneva, and the Soviets would have to go ahead and sign a separate peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic. <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> also placed some stress on the issue of reducing Western troops in Berlin, particularly emphasizing the subversive activity which he alleged was carried on under cover of the occupation as well as the creation of tension which the Allied forces in Berlin occasioned. On the subject of private meetings, <persName corresp="#p_RSP1">Reilly</persName> said he had expressed disappointment about developments on the opening day of the conference. <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> said that the private meetings between the four had always been unsatisfactory to the Soviets and had not been very fruitful anyway. After further prodding by <persName corresp="#p_RSP1">Reilly</persName> he finally took the position that there probably would have to be three kinds of meetings during the present phase of the conference: Plenary sessions, smaller sessions at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Palais with six countries present and quadripartite luncheons, dinners and teas.</p>
<p>(b) <persName corresp="#p_LJ1">Laloy</persName> reported on an exchange which he had had yesterday with Groubyakov. Groubyakov had likewise attached great importance to the All-German Committee. He indicated that the Soviets might be flexible regarding the time period and perhaps even on the question of parity, but the creation of an All-German Committee was indispensable.</p>
<p>(c) <persName corresp="#p_HPF1">Hancock</persName> reported on a discussion which he and Rumbold had had with <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> yesterday at the Palais. <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> said he had been drawing up a paper comparing the Western and the Soviet positions. <persName corresp="#p_HPF1">Hancock</persName> indicated that the British were likewise preparing such a paper. <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName>’s reaction was “Splendid, why don’t you give me a copy of it.” <persName corresp="#p_HPF1">Hancock</persName> indicated that he thought that this might provide a basis for a fruitful <pb xml:id="pg_996" n="996" facs="1021"/>exercise, but noted that <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> had not offered to provide the British with his paper. (After some discussion in the Coordinating Group, the general consensus was that provision of such a paper to the Soviets probably involved more disadvantages than advantages, particularly because it would put the Soviets in the position of being able to split the differences between the two extreme positions.)</p>
<p>8. The British Delegation distributed two papers: (a) A comparison of the Western and Soviet positions, and (b) Some questions which might be put to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in connection with this comparison.<note n="2" xml:id="d443fn2">Neither found.</note> There was some discussion of these papers and a number of changes were suggested by the American, French and German representatives present.</p>
<p>9. The Germans distributed a new paper<note n="3" xml:id="d443fn3">Not found.</note> which the Ambassador described as a summary of the ideas of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> as reformulated in the light of discussions of the past few days (he did not mention any discussions with the Chancellor as being among those which had contributed to this reformulation).</p>

Asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to correct him if wrong in describing Soviet position.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> regretted lack of Western support for Soviet proposals re Berlin and discussed Soviet June 19 proposals along familiar lines. Said <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had apparently summed up on basis what <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not said rather than what he had said.</p>
<p>After <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> noted <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had answered his questions of yesterday re all-German committee and expressed his concern at answers, <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> stated Soviet proposals re Berlin had full support of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and argued along familiar lines for all-German committee.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> attacked linking of all-German committee and Berlin settlement and pointed out differences between Western proposal for mixed committee and Soviet all-German committee, again stating latter would perpetuate division of Germany. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> concluded meeting by replying to some of <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName>’s points. Date of next meeting left for later agreement. <hi rend="italic">End summary.</hi></p>
<p>After Secretary had spoken, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> supported his statement and chided <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> for unwillingness discuss Western June 16 proposal which had been put up three days before Soviet proposal. He noted both sides agreed on interim arrangements for Berlin provided these satisfactory. He then gave respective West and Soviet positions re: a) force levels; b) armaments in Berlin; c) activities; d) duration of interim arrangements; e) access; f) situation at end interim arrangements. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he understood that during interim period a) no unilateral action would be taken by either side; b) if agreement not reached, four powers would resume discussions and pending results such discussions, situation would remain unaltered. Noted West maintains four powers could continue negotiate in some forum or through diplomatic channels during duration of interim arrangements. Understood <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had said that if either of two Germanies found all-German committee unacceptable, some other way could be found to carry on discussions between two Germanies. Concluded there seemed some elements of flexibility in Soviet position and of agreement between Soviets and West.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said conference should discuss concrete matters. Regretted lack Western support for “free city” and June 19 proposals. Emphasized Soviets could not accept perpetuation occupation West Berlin. Reaffirmed that duration interim arrangements relatively unimportant but said Soviets attach importance to reaching agreement on level forces and curtailment subversive activities. Re all-German committee, considered link between it and Berlin problem logical. Confirmed <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s understanding other forum possible but he gathered from press that Federal Republic opposed to any conversations between two Germanies. If this so, all should seek persuade Federal Republic such <pb xml:id="pg_998" n="998" facs="1023"/>conversations necessary to reduce tension and further cause of peace. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> also repeated familiar Soviet position re subjects all-German committee should consider. Could not agree with Secretary that Berlin crisis instigated by Soviets. Re role of U.N., Soviet “free city” proposal contemplated U.N. participation in guarantee of city’s status and Soviets could only consider U.N. participation in concrete context. Would wish to know in what U.N. would participate.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 148. For <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> from the Secretary. I am disturbed at possible misunderstandings in Defense and State with respect to our negotiating position here owing to fact that position paper<note n="1" xml:id="d445fn1">Attachment B to <ref target="#d418">Document 418</ref>.</note> which I had discussed with President and which he had approved in general terms had not been discussed with all elements State and Defense. Matter somewhat further confused by analyses from Defense of working paper transmitted by State which I had never seen and which indicated certain alternative fall-back positions which had never received my approval.<note n="2" xml:id="d445fn2">Not further identified.</note></p>
<p>In light this situation, believe it would be desirable have conference between yourself, <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> and, if possible, President so that clear understanding will be reached among us as to what we conceive our negotiating position here to be.</p>
<p>The position paper in form of draft communiqué given to President shortly after my arrival Washington contained three substantive changes from the paper submitted to the Soviets as the last Allied proposal on June 16. These were:</p>
<list><item>1. The utilization of a representative of the Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to report to the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> on propaganda activities directed at either East</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_999" n="999" facs="1024"/>
<item>or West Berlin which could be considered interference in internal affairs. This change obviously desirable from our point of view.</item>
<item>2. The creation of a four power committee with German advisers to carry out discussions regarding a German peace treaty, the reunification or Germany, and facilitating interchanges between East and West Germany. This new proposal would have been a counterproposal to the Russian all-German committee. It was approved orally by <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> before leaving Geneva and appeared in written form in German working paper<note n="3" xml:id="d445fn3">See <ref target="#d433fn1">footnote 1, Document 433</ref>.</note> submitted to three Western Foreign Ministers just before reassembling here. This item now under cloud because of possibility its being repudiated by <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and French desire that it not be tied in with temporary Berlin settlement but considered as entirely separable item. If the Soviets accept this proposal (which they almost certainly will not) I believe that our position would be strengthened by this reaffirmation of four-power responsibility for German reunification and by bringing to bear West German influence on the East Germans however lacking in confidence in themselves the former may be.</item>
<item>3. A time limit on temporary arrangement regarding Berlin in lieu of latter carrying on until reunification of Germany. In discussing this last point with the President, no specific time was fixed upon but in Russian proposal for time limit Russians when pressed suggested first one year, then year and a half, then said time limit neither important nor matter of principle.</item>
</list>
<p>With respect to above changes, there appeared to be question in some people’s minds as to whether matters of principle sacrificed or occupational rights forfeited. In discussion with our Allies here, we have made language this paper conform almost identically with wording our offer of June 16. If our language accepted, both our Allies and we convinced no such rights forfeited nor any sacrifice of principle. We are unanimous in conviction no further concessions should be made and are sticking to this.</p>
<p>I also discussed with the President leaving the troop figure blank for summit decision. For negotiating purposes here there would be no acceptance of any reduction, the tactic being to use the present figure of 11,000 or some similar formulation and as a concession agree to leave a blank for consideration by the heads of government.</p>
<p>If there are any doubts as to propriety or wisdom our negotiating position as indicated above, would like to be advised soonest as I am most anxious there should be perfectly clear understanding and agreement on line we are taking.</p>

<p>[Here follow a paragraph listing the participants at the meeting and agenda item 1.]</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Berlin</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> indicated that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> would report to the Council on the progress, or lack of progress, in Tripartite Berlin Contingency Planning.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> comments that with respect to such planning a great deal of work has been done. On these plans there has been a wide area of agreement at the working level but very few final agreements. The most serious problem was planning with respect to surface access to Berlin. On this subject the British have had second thoughts based on a conversation that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> thought he had had with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>. In any event, the British had not approved the basic paper on this subject at the governmental level. There had likewise been no approval on the surface access plan by the French but we believe this was simply that President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had been away from Paris for some time.</p>
<p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> also indicated that we had undertaken negotiations with Pan American Airlines to provide war risk insurance which could come into effect if the Soviets withdrew their personnel from the Berlin Air Safety Center. Similar negotiations are being undertaken by the U.K. authorities with the British European Airways and by the French with Air France. In this connection Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> briefly explained the various proposals for communicating flight information to the East Germans without becoming involved in direct communication with them. In this context he noted that there had been no recommendations as yet from General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>’s “Live Oak” with respect to this problem.</p>
<p>Turning to the so-called Quiet Precautionary Measures, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that a number of such measures had been initiated but so far without much effect on the Soviets. The U.S. has accordingly proposed <pb xml:id="pg_1001" n="1001" facs="1026"/>additional measures, but there has been no response from the U.K. and France on these additional measures. The British did not seem to want to plan for further eventualities until after the obvious failure of the initial probe of Soviet intentions in blocking Allied access to Berlin. On the other hand, the Three Powers had reached an agreement as to action in the United Nations.</p>
<p>With respect to the so-called Economic Counter-Measures or Counter-Harassments, a Tripartite study had reached the conclusion that none of these proposed measures was likely to be effective.</p>
<p>In sum, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> found the situation somewhat unsatisfactory. The British were apparently convinced that there was going to be a summit conference and were therefore much inclined to drag their feet with respect to contingency planning.</p>
<p>Expressing surprise, the President inquired whether a summit meeting was supposed to guarantee a satisfactory solution of the Berlin problem. He stated that he could not understand why the possibility of a summit conference should be permitted to stop contingency planning on Berlin.</p>
<p>In reply Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the British apparently felt that the Soviets would not take any unilateral action with respect to Berlin prior to a summit meeting and the British also seemed to feel that a summit conference will manage to accomplish something which will prevent such unilateral Soviet action.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> stated that this discussion reminded him that he had intended to comment briefly on the state of Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s health. The intelligence community has concluded that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is very tired but that he comes back quickly. There was doubt, therefore, if anything dramatic was likely to happen to the Soviet leader.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">Luncheon Meeting Today</p>
<p>1. In preparation for the luncheon meeting of the four Foreign Ministers today, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that it might be necessary at the meeting of the Western Foreign Ministers this morning to slow down <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> who wants to plunge ahead. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> also recommended that we try to get agreement that the wording in any document refer to “not increasing” troop strength in Berlin and only as a last concession agree on leaving this blank. The Germans, both here and in Bonn, now seem agreed on the plan for a Four-Power Commission with German advisors. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> continued, as far as we know, the French are still opposed and we should try to get <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s agreement to such a commission.</p>
<p>The Secretary agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>’s recommendation that after the meeting of the Western Foreign Ministers today the revised version of the Draft Communiqué<note n="2" xml:id="d447fn2">See <ref target="#d453">Document 453</ref>.</note> should be sent to Washington. The Secretary speculated that the French may wish to check whether the second German paper<note n="3" xml:id="d447fn3">Not found.</note> (given us on July 16) represents <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s views.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Developments in Germany</p>
<p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> recommended that the Secretary have a frank private discussion with <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> in the next few days with the fewest advisors possible present. The Secretary agreed this would be a useful step.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ1">McCloy</persName> had told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> was irritated with <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> because it had been reported that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had called him “a tiresome old man.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> added that the British think the Germans are relying too heavily on the blocking power of the French in Geneva.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1003" n="1003" facs="1028"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Visit to Berlin</p>
<p>3. Several possibilities were mentioned regarding the timing of the Secretary’s visit to Berlin but no agreement was reached. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> recommended against a stop in Bonn on this trip. He added that the Berliners are apprehensive that we will make concessions here beyond those they believe we have already made.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Press Developments</p>
<p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said that Soviet briefer <persName corresp="#p_KMA1">Kharlamov</persName> had said that five of the six participants yesterday had displayed a better understanding of the problems facing the conference. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> was the exception. <persName corresp="#p_KMA1">Kharlamov</persName> called attention to what he described as a new point in the Secretary’s statement, namely, that we were willing to discuss all methods of unification including the Soviet proposals. He described <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> as showing more flexibility.</p>
<p>There was a general discussion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName>’s proposal that something be said to the press after each private meeting of the Ministers, including today’s luncheon. The Secretary expressed the view that any statements on substance might wreck the private meetings. He thought a background press conference might occasionally be useful.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Occupation Rights</p>
<p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> was disturbed by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s clear statement yesterday that the Soviets would, under no circumstances, accept the perpetuation of the occupation regime in Berlin. He believed it would be futile to reach agreement on details, such as troops and propaganda, and then be faced with a denial of our basic rights. The Secretary thought this point might be discussed at the meeting of the Western Foreign Ministers today, noting that it will become acute when we get down to discussing the actual wording of any document. The Secretary was skeptical of the possibility of reaching an agreement on troop strength in Berlin or on propaganda control, the latter because the Soviets will never accept a reciprocal agreement in this regard. The Secretary agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> that it was interesting that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had not mentioned the most important question of all—access to Berlin.</p>
<p>In a discussion of the question of the control of propaganda, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> said that the British and French have now accepted the use of the phrase “in and about Berlin”, but the British have only done so as a bargaining point.</p>
<p>The Secretary hoped it would be possible to get <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to discuss point by point our June 16 paper, something he has avoided doing thus far.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 338. Moscow for the Ambassador. Four Western Foreign Ministers met this morning to discuss tactics for today’s luncheon meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. It was agreed to endeavor to direct conversation to Western June 16 paper, but not to bring up proposal for four power commission. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he would like to pick up his statement of yesterday comparing Western and Soviet positions. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> stressed importance of concentrating on principal issues which he listed as time limit, situation at end of period and all-German committee in order to avoid appearance of West blocking an agreement almost achieved. In discussion of relative importance of several issues, Secretary pointed out that question of access, although it might seem less important an issue in interim agreement than it would be if separate German peace treaty were signed, was in fact particularly important on civil side. In fact it offered only opportunity we might have to improve Berlin situation from our point of view.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> reaffirmed Bonn’s unwillingness to agree to any arrangement which called for direct discussion between East and West Germans but reaffirmed Bonn’s support of proposal for four power commission. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, however, demonstrated reluctance to accept even this formula and took up willingly <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s idea that thought should be given to a possible formula for keeping present conference in being in some form as alternative to four power commission proposal. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> undertook to prepare something along this line, and it was agreed that four power commission proposal would not be raised with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> until Ministers reached a decision concerning possible alternatives.</p>
<p>Baraduc (French Press Officer) reported that Kharlarhov (Soviet Press Officer) had asked him at what time he should appear at French residence following luncheon in accordance with past practice at private meetings. It was noted that this revealed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s decision that today’s luncheon would in effect mark resumption of private meetings.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> reported that correspondents were talking about a new US draft. It was agreed to tell press that there were many papers and to deny that any specific paper, US or otherwise, was subject of particular attention of Ministers.</p>

<p>After lunch today with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> there was two-hour discussion with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> which proved to be totally unsatisfactory.<note n="1" xml:id="d449fn1">A detailed seven-page memorandum of this conversation, US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/133, is <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, CF1341.</note> Secretary was accompanied by <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LJ1">Laloy</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_RSP1">Reilly</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HPF1">Hancock</persName>; and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> by <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName>. Conversation was entirely in English and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> while completely intransigent was amiable throughout.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made perfectly clear that Soviets now insist on Western agreement to some form of all-German negotiations as condition for interim Berlin settlement. He consistently parried all attempts by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and Secretary to elicit clear statement as to Soviet reason for link between these two matters by stating, as he has in plenary sessions to date, that link is logical and real.</p>
<p>He stated that while Soviets are prepared to consider other forms of all-German collaboration it is essential that German negotiations be conducted independently and not to “control or protection” of four powers. He invited West to submit alternative proposals re negotiating body if Soviet suggestion for all-German committee unacceptable.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> rebuffed repeated efforts, particularly by Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, to ascertain correct interpretation of duration aspect of Soviet June 19 proposal by insisting that Soviet statements in this connection perfectly clear and only Soviet interpretation should be relied on. At one point, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> repeated his summation (given July 16 plenary) of his understanding of Soviet and Western positions on various aspects of possible interim Berlin settlement—troop levels, weapons, activities, duration, and access. With regard to duration, he gave as his interpretation of Soviet position that end of fixed period <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s would resume negotiations and that pending result thereof situation would remain unchanged and neither side would take unilateral action; he then put specific question to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> as to whether this a correct interpretation. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> brushed off latter inquiry by saying Soviet position was as expressed (as he did throughout meeting) and re other aspects said no <pb xml:id="pg_1006" n="1006" facs="1031"/>understanding existed except possibly on weapons. In any case, he added, all aspects interlinked and impossible for Soviets to take position on one without reaching understanding on whole package. He then dismissed subject by reverting to his oft-repeated demand for discussion of all-German negotiations.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s suggestion that <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s lunch with him Monday and hold plenary Tuesday.</p>
<p>After <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s departure Secretary discussed with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> the significance of present Soviet interansigence. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s reaction was that we should not subject ourselves further to such insulting treatment by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and that we should bring negotiations to a close. He said it was perfectly clear to him now that the Soviets are interested solely in German question and are exploiting West’s concern over Berlin in order enhance status of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> by bringing two Germanies together on an equal basis. In his view if we should agree any such arrangement we would inevitably contribute to the weakening of West Germany which would mean a real danger of war which does not exist now. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, obviously somewhat disturbed by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s reaction, suggested Ministers should ponder on it overnight and meet tomorrow at 11 am in an effort further to assess the significance of the present Soviet position and estimate where to go from here.</p>

<item>Four-Power Commission</item>
</list>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> came to see me last night at his request. His main point was that he thinks it essential Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> should at the first opportunity and <pb xml:id="pg_1007" n="1007" facs="1032"/>in strong terms reject the Soviet proposal for an all-German committee. He feels the Soviets are under the impression that we have an open mind on this. He also feels that the Soviets may misunderstand the relative politeness and moderation of the Western Foreign Ministers in their conduct of debate with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. He confirmed that the Germans will accept (<persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> has specifically approved yesterday) the concept of a four-power commission with German advisers attached. It was clear there is the proviso, however, that this should not be merely a device to lock the two German delegations in a room together. I said my own concept was that on reunification and the principles of the peace treaty the four-power commission would formulate their views, calling on the two delegations of advisers to speak or submit memoranda as the four powers considered helpful, and that remissions to the advisers by the commission for joint proposals should be confined to such technical matters as freedom of movement, etc. In any event, I said that if the Soviets accepted a four-power commission proposal, which I greatly doubted, I did not think it would be necessary here to get into a debate on the exact terms of reference of the commission. I referred to the difficulty we have in feeling that there is any consistency or reliability in positions taken by the German delegation here. He was guarded in what he said, but he did not disguise his own unhappiness or the source of the difficulty.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 149. For the President from the Secretary.</p>
<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>I feel you should know that the conference today has taken what I consider a serious turn for the worse. This may of course be standard Soviet tactics or <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> may have instructions to stonewall until some particular scheduled event in Poland or even the Vice President’s arrival in Moscow. There is no doubt however but that the Soviet position has hardened since the recess. This afternoon <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was not only obstructive but objectionable in the talk we had in private session following <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s luncheon.<note n="1" xml:id="d451fn1">See <ref target="#d449">Document 449</ref>.</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1008" n="1008" facs="1033"/>
<p>All three of us did our best to pin him down on what our position would be with respect to our rights at the expiration of any temporary agreement on Berlin. All that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was interested in talking about was the all-German committee which he had proposed, or some variant of it which would maintain its essential features of forcing the Federal Republic to deal directly with the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> as an equal, thereby enhancing the latter’s prestige and in fact taking the first step toward the type of confederation which the Soviets advocate.</p>
<p>Every time (and it must have happened a dozen times) <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> or I asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in what respect was the interpretation which we had placed on his statements on our rights incorrect <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> gave us one of two replies. Either he said without acknowledging the question “Let us now discuss the all-German committee” or he said “The Soviet Union has made itself entirely clear on this matter.” Although his manner was polite and almost genial the net impression was close to insulting. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> feels that we are approaching the break-up of the conference which does not unduly distress him and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> is depressed. I think myself it is too early to judge but I did want to send you a word of warning on the way things seem to be going. Mac and I are lunching alone with Mr. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> tomorrow and we will have another quadripartite luncheon meeting on Monday after which we should know more. We also have agreed to a plenary for Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>This morning after Cabinet <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> and I discussed matter briefly with the President and informed him of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views regarding situation at end of a possible moratorium.

<p>We have some trouble with your paragraph 3 because time limit on the Russian proposal and the time limit on ours seem to be blended in a manner which could be misleading and in the end justify a Russian pretension that they relate to an agreed time limit on our rights.</p>
<p>All interested elements in Dept otherwise in full agreement with <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> on the understanding that time limit referred to in para 3 refers to our suggestions of moratorium at end of which there would be no dimunition in basic rights rather than to original Soviet proposal regarding a time limit which we consider to be a horse of quite a different color.</p>
<p>Also with respect to second section of paragraph 3, you say that in discussion with our Allies we have made language in this paper conform almost identically with wording our offer June 16. We, of course, are not able to comment on this, as we have not been provided with the changes of text.</p>

Following is current version of draft communiqué prepared in Department prior departure of delegation including changes made as result discussions here in Western Deputies Coordinating Group. Draft not approved by Foreign Ministers. While copies distributed-to coordinating group, all of these collected at end of meeting. Although existence this document has apparently become known to press, knowledge its contents still being tightly held. <hi rend="italic">Begin text—</hi></p>
<p>I. The Foreign Ministers agreed on the following proposals:</p>
<p>(A) That a Four-Power Standing Commission be established, which will make arrangements for the cooperation of German advisers, to continue the discussion of the German problem.</p>
<p>(B) That the Commission discuss concrete measures for the reunification of Germany, with free elections at an appropriate stage in the process, and principles for a peace treaty with Germany. The advisers will be requested to prepare proposals for the extension and development of technical contacts between the two parts of Germany and the free movement of persons, ideas and publications between the two parts of Germany.</p>
<p>(C) Unless agreement has been reached on plans for reunification and for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany at an earlier date, the Foreign Ministers will reconvene at the end of (blank) years to continue their discussion of these subjects.</p>
<p>II. With respect to Berlin, the Foreign Ministers recognized that, pending reunification, the existing situation and the agreements at present in force can be modified in certain respects and have consequently agreed upon the following:</p>
<p>(A) The Soviet Foreign Minister has made known the decision of the Soviet Government no longer to maintain forces in Berlin.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom and the United States declare that it is the intention of their governments to limit the combined total of their forces in Berlin to the present figure (approximately 11,000) and to continue to arm these forces only with conventional weapons. The three Ministers further declare that their governments will from time to time consider the possibility of reducing such forces if developments in the situation permit.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1011" n="1011" facs="1036"/>
<p>(B) Free and unrestricted access to West Berlin by land, by water, and by air for all persons, goods and communications, including those of the forces of the Western powers stationed in Berlin, will be maintained in accordance with the procedures in effect in April 1959. Freedom of movement will continue to be maintained between East and West Berlin. All disputes which might arise with respect to access will be raised and settled between the four governments. The latter will establish a Quadripartite Commission which will meet in Berlin to examine in the first instance any difficulties arising in connection with access and will seek to settle such difficulties. The Commission may make arrangements to consult German experts as necessary.</p>
<p>(C) Measures will be taken, consistent with fundamental rights and liberties, to avoid activities in or about Berlin which might either disrupt public order or seriously affect the rights of others. The Secretary General of the United Nations will be requested to provide a representative, supported by adequate staff, to be established in Berlin, with free access to all parts of the city for the purpose of reporting to the Secretary General any propaganda activities in or about Berlin which appear to be in conflict with the foregoing principles. The four governments will consult with the Secretary General in order to determine the appropriate action to be taken in respect to any such report.</p>
<p>(D) The arrangement specified in sub-paragraphs (A) through (C) above will remain in effect until reunification of Germany provided that, in the absence of reunification, or agreed plans for reunification, the Foreign Ministers will meet at the end of (blank) years to review these arrangements. <hi rend="italic">End text.</hi></p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 353. Eyes only for Ambassadors at Moscow, Paris, London, Bonn and eyes only <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> Berlin. Western Foreign Ministers met this morning at Villa les Ormeaux to discuss present state of conference and tactics for next meetings. It was agreed to submit at earliest plenary session proposal for extension of present Geneva Conference under no time limit as counter-proposal to Soviet all-German committee plan. It was also agreed ultimately to accept time limit of not less than two and a half years in interim arrangement for Berlin.</p>
<p>At outset of meeting Secretary expressed his concern at appearance West was abandoning overall German problem as well as his concern at <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s implied interpretation that US was not squarely opposed to all-German committee. The Secretary expressed his desire to make firm statements on both counts at next plenary session. In discussion of problem posed by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s apparent adamant stand on all-German committee, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> observed that conference could not be permitted to break down on question of contacts between Germans and submitted draft of possible Western proposal<note n="1" xml:id="d454fn1"><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s draft has not been found.</note> to counter Soviet position. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> saw no purpose of trying to do anything with respect to elements interim Berlin settlement until this preliminary question was solved. He thought that if conference failed, it would be on this point and not on such questions as propaganda in Berlin or level of troops there. Issue was simply that under Berlin threat Soviets were trying to force on us their solution for Germany as a whole.</p>
<p>It was agreed that this problem of linkage and all-German committee was both important and difficult from public relations point of view and that therefore proposal should be tabled in plenary session as soon as possible. To this end it was also agreed to seek <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s agreement to advance next plenary from Tuesday to Monday (<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> subsequently agreed). <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s proposal as amended by Ministers reads as follows: “The Geneva Conference of Foreign Ministers as at present constituted shall continue in being for the purpose of considering the <pb xml:id="pg_1013" n="1013" facs="1038"/>German problem as a whole. It should also consider questions relating to the extension and development of contacts between the two parts of Germany. For these purposes the conference shall meet from time to time at such level and at such place as are agreed. The conference may also make special arrangements for the consideration of particular questions arising out of its terms of reference as defined above.”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> thought it was highly important to clarify <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s understanding of Western position not only on question of Germany as a whole but also on the issue of linkage and of a time limit for interim Berlin solution. He pointed out that Ministers were compelled to take decision on this question of time limit since otherwise it was not realistic to endeavor both to deny linkage between interim Berlin solution and German problem and to stick to terms of July 16 paper which called for interim period to run until reunification. Accordingly, he asked whether Ministers were prepared to accept time limit on interim Berlin solution. Secretary replied he was prepared provided agreement was completely clear that at end of period Western rights in Berlin would not be impaired. He thought period should not be less than 30 months and that for bargaining purposes we should probably start with figure of not less than five years. It was noted that public opinion had already pretty much accepted the concept of time limit for Berlin interim solution. Secretary observed that drafting of language to cover second Berlin phase would be particularly difficult.</p>
<p>Secretary raised question of his visit to Berlin for purpose of dedication street to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName> and said he was considering making a visit on Saturday, July 25, if convenient and agreeable to his colleagues. There was no objection.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> announced that he would be absent in Paris Wednesday morning for Cabinet meeting but would return to Geneva by 2 p.m. There was some discussion of problem of reporting to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> latest developments and Ministers welcomed <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s offer to accompany <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> to Paris on Wednesday and appear before <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council that morning.</p>

<p>After social luncheon today <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> took me into separate room and said had one or two matters discuss. Before he started I raised with him two questions:</p>
<p>1. Moving forward plenary session from Tuesday to Monday at 4:00 p.m., so that it would follow our private luncheon session. This suggestion followed his own thought we should wind up talks and get down to concrete cases. (Western Foreign Ministers had agreed best to have plenary Monday afternoon in order advance time of formal tabling of proposal for continuation Foreign Ministers talks at lower level reported in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 353.)<note n="1" xml:id="d455fn1"><ref target="#d454">Document 454</ref>.</note></p>
<p>2. I then mentioned possibility my going Berlin this coming Saturday saying trip to be in connection with dedication <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster Dulles</persName> Street. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> volunteered that such a trip would be considered provocative and would certainly be understood as political gesture having bearing on present discussions, however, he said if I were determined to go nothing he could do about it. I told him I would probably go but no final decision had been reached but would advise him when decision made.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then raised the question to which I tried to get an answer at conference yesterday, namely, an understanding that if temporary agreement reached in Berlin and were followed by further session Foreign Ministers none of existing rights or obligations under quadripartite occupation would have been abrogated by interim arrangement Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he would try to give as clear an answer as he could, namely, the following: Soviet Government would sign no agreement of any kind which would perpetuate occupation rights Berlin. However, Soviet Government on its part would not require any statement on part Western Foreign Ministers that such rights abrogated by temporary agreement. In other words, rights as such should not be mentioned. However, as Foreign Minister talking to Foreign Minister, he could assure me no unilateral action would be taken during interim arrangement nor during negotiations following such arrangement. This was as far as he authorized to go. Am now consulting legal talent delegation to see how above is interpreted. Would be glad to have Department’s views.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1015" n="1015" facs="1040"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then raised question all-German committee. He again expressed himself vehemently on fact <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> refusal discuss German problems with East Germans. He said only US had influence with <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and could persuade him to change his mind. He said he laid such store in necessity of agreement for all-German talks that he doubted whether any Berlin interim agreement could be reached without satisfactory understanding this point. He then said he would, of course, await with interest what Western powers had to suggest since we had told him yesterday we would consider possible alternatives. I gave no indication of nature alternate proposal we had discussed this morning. In addition to his insistence on all-German committee, he repeated his now familiar arguments on necessary link between time limit for all-German committee to report and time limit on temporary status Berlin arrangements. With respect to this latter point, he was not as vehement as in talks yesterday.</p>
<p>My impression is that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would like to have extended his bilateral conversations covering entire area matters under previous consideration at the conference. I felt this impossible without my Western colleagues and so begged to be excused after some forty-five minutes conversation.</p>

<p>In hour-long informal discussion after <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> lunch today for four Foreign Ministers, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> took lead in giving <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> preview of <pb xml:id="pg_1016" n="1016" facs="1041"/>Western proposal for dealing with problem of Germany as a whole (text <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 553 [<hi rend="italic">353</hi>]).<note n="1" xml:id="d457fn1"><ref target="#d454">Document 454</ref>.</note> While reserving final judgment pending opportunity examine text, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> expressed view proposal unacceptable since it provided for continued four power responsibility on reunification. This concept, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said, is contrary to Soviet position that this must be worked out only by Germans themselves, a position which is supported by present factual situation. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> argued that acceptable solution could not prejudice either side’s fundamental positions and that West proposal, with its built-in flexibility on negotiating procedures, met this requirement. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, however, denied this, pointing out that essence of West proposal is to preserve four power responsibility for reunification which unacceptable to Soviets. The Secretary commented that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s attitude means basic change in Soviet position since 1955 when Bulganin recognized four power responsibility for reunification by signature of heads of government directive<note n="2" xml:id="d457fn2">For text of the Heads of Government Directive to their Foreign Ministers, July 23, 1955, see <ref target="frus1955-57v05"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1955–1957, vol. V</ref>, pp. 527–528.</note> and asked what had changed in situation to warrant this reversal of Soviet position. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that Soviets and West placed different interpretation on directive and this an old story. The Secretary then asked if, as apparent from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks, agreement on this point depends on West’s acceptance of Soviet position and if Soviets, as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said in Friday’s private meeting, refuse discuss elements of interim Berlin solution until agreement reached, is it <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s view that we should terminate discussions? While not directly responsive to Secretary’s inquiry, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s reply that “He was not saying this” could be interpreted (and was so interpreted by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>) that Soviet position re discussion of Berlin situation perhaps now somewhat less intransigeant than appeared Friday. This was only positive result of meeting, if it can be so described. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> accepted <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> invitation to lunch tomorrow. Secretary declined because previous Red Cross commitment but will join others after lunch. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> will however attend lunch itself.

<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, in uncompromising statement, emphasized basically different approaches of Soviet and Western proposals and thought new Western proposal unacceptable because its basis entirely different from that of Soviets. Again stated Soviet willingness consider forms for discussions between two Germanies other than all-German committee which were agreeable to all parties but not subject to four power surveillance. Reserved right comment further. Secretary appealed for consideration of principles, not forms of discussions.</p>
<p>Next meeting July 22 at 4 pm. <hi rend="italic">End summary.</hi></p>
<p>After Secretary’s statement and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s very short statement in support, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> briefly reviewed conference to date. Noted both Western proposal June 16 and Soviet proposal June 19 for interim Berlin settlement dealt with same general subjects, e.g., force levels, activities, etc. Important point was fact <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> not willing say clearly what would be situation at end interim period. West could not accept blank check on this point. Also said it unreasonable to expect West accept Soviet contention that agreement on all-German committee must precede discussion other points interim Berlin settlement. However, new Western proposals represent attempt go some way to meet Soviet position. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> objected to all-German committee on following grounds: (A) Juridical—would involve de jure recognition of division of Germany; <pb xml:id="pg_1018" n="1018" facs="1043"/>(B) practically no progress could be made if four powers abrogated responsibilities; (C) procedural—Soviet proposal would make possible use of threat and pressure on all-German committee members and on West Berlin people. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> noted new Western proposal was flexible, did not shelve all-German question and provided (in its last sentence) for exploring different ways to make progress.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> spoke next emphasizing necessity for <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> participation on basis full equality in negotiations concerning Germany and supporting all-German committee. Denied Secretary’s statement that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> regime is imposed on people. Suggested possibility establishing six power body, all participants having equal status, to consider concerted views of two other bodies consisting of: (A) Two Germanies; (B) four powers. Stressed necessity setting time limit for deliberations. Said reunification could not be brought about from outside as West proposed. Re contacts between two Germanies, meant fundamental political contacts such as agreement on renunciation of force, rather than technical agreements on railroads, etc.</p>
<p>After <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> had given <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> support to new Western proposal, saying it differed only in form from earlier <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> proposal spoke for itself since position <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> on peace treaty and reunification well known. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said he would speak briefly on proposals Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> had just put forward, reserving right say more later. Said Western and Soviet proposals envisaged basically different approaches. Soviet propose four powers should assist two Germanies to reach agreement between themselves while West envisages settlement by four powers of German questions with assistance German advisers. Reunification only possible through rapprochement between two Germanies and Soviets proposed all-German committee as form of securing this which would be acceptable to all. Soviets willing consider other forms such as commencement in Geneva of negotiations between <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> without control or surveillance of four powers. Door not shut to other proposals but new Western proposal does not reflect desire find another acceptable form because its fundamental basis differs from that of Soviet proposal and does not contemplate equality and sovereignty for parties concerned. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> appealed to West to be more flexible in taking into account Soviet views. If differences between social and economic structures of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> did not exist there would be no problem of finding proper form of discussion. Therefore, should not dwell on these differences as Secretary had. Wrong to say as <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> did that Soviets underestimate importance of reunification. They merely favor realistic approach.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1019" n="1019" facs="1044"/>
<p>Secretary concluded meeting by noting <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had talked of basic principles and asked for greater flexibility by West in connection with Soviet views. Hoped that principles themselves can be discussed henceforth, not just forms for working out principles.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 343. Private sessions. For Secretary from Acting Secretary. Re <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 352.<note n="1" xml:id="d459fn1"><ref target="#d455">Document 455</ref>.</note> You certainly have our sympathy in your dealings with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. These are our comments.</p>
<p>(1) <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s reaction to your reference to the possibility of your visit seems to be standard boiler plate. It is reminiscent of Soviet and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> objections to West Berlin elections. We are glad you mentioned it in the context you did as this method would be as disarming as anything could. Obviously your trip is a political gesture and we would hope its effect on your present discussions would be useful. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks seem to us to make visit mandatory.</p>
<p>(2) We find that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> has surpassed himself when, after stating (Para. 2) the Soviet Government would sign no agreement of any kind which would perpetuate occupation rights, he adds “Soviet Government on its part would not require any statement on part Western Foreign Ministers that such rights abrogated by temporary agreement” then summarizes “in other words, rights as such should not be mentioned.”</p>
<p>This statement illuminates further Soviet tactics to develop an accumulation of words out of which later will emerge as a result of repetition of distorted interpretation a false impression we have agreed on a terminal point for our rights. In view this, silence on subject seems clearly unacceptable.</p>
<p>It might be well to say to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that looking over your notes of this part of your conversation you believe you must have misunderstood, <pb xml:id="pg_1020" n="1020" facs="1045"/>or there must have been an error of translation if he spoke in Russian. You could add that surely he would not state this in terms of a Soviet requirement. We could not recognize that. We are discussing a matter of our rights. These we intend to mention whenever we consider it necessary. It would be in the general interest of both sides not to lend ourselves to equivocation.</p>
<p>In any event, Soviet position expressed by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> makes us feel irreducible minimum would be explicit Western statement re retention of rights until Germany reunified and of continuing Western determination maintain these rights at any cost.</p>
<p>Re <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 353<note n="2" xml:id="d459fn2"><ref target="#d454">Document 454</ref>.</note> proposal for extension present Geneva conference seems to us a good move. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s analysis of problem (last sentence para 2) struck us as particularly simple, lucid statement of basic issue.</p>

<item>Discussion of Western Summit Meeting; British-West German Relations</item>
</list>
<p>The Secretary queried <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> as to his views concerning the desirability of a Western Summit meeting in the event that the present Geneva <pb xml:id="pg_1021" n="1021" facs="1046"/>Conference adjourns or breaks up without positive results. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> replied that such a meeting might be a good idea, but that it should not be held immediately following a breakup of the present conference. Perhaps it could be held just before the reconvening of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly on September 14. However, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> did not know how this would fit into British planning concerning elections, and he realized that it also might present some difficulties for the President’s schedule, particularly in connection with the termination of the Congressional session.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> went on to say that he thought a Western Summit meeting could be held in Paris and that this would be especially desirable since it would provide an opportunity for talks between the President and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> thought that such talks should be held before the fall and that they represent a means of beginning to get out of our present difficulties.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> added that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> also would like a Western Summit meeting. Perhaps this would present an opportunity for a smoothing over of difficulties between <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> wondered what the basic reasons might be for the differences between the United Kingdom and Germany; he thought they might be based on personal divergence between <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>.</p>
<p>The Secretary suggested that economic considerations might be at the root of the problem. He said that British sensitivity with regard to economic actions which might affect their own existence is very great.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> commented that an additional reason might be that the wounds left by World War II have not completely healed in Great Britain. This was particularly evident in the <persName corresp="#p_HT1">Heuss</persName> visit,<note n="1" xml:id="d460fn1">President <persName corresp="#p_HT1">Heuss</persName> made a State visit to the United Kingdom beginning October 20, 1958.</note> and politicians are quick to note such things.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> concluded the discussion by saying that economic considerations also affect French relations with the United Kingdom, but not to such an extent as pertains to the German-UK relationships. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> was inclined to think that much of the trouble lay in the fact that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> is an old man who is inclined to be very suspicious. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> seems to believe that there is some secret agreement between <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The French have tried to dissipate these worries on <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s part, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said, but without success.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 156. For the President from the Secretary.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>Last Friday night I expressed in my message to you<note n="1" xml:id="d461fn1">See <ref target="#d451">Document 451</ref>.</note> my feeling that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s post-recess attitude did not augur well for any tangible progress at this conference. Results of yesterday’s meetings confirm and deepen this impression. As you know, after a protracted period of coordination with our Allies we presented yesterday to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> first in private and then in plenary our counter-proposal to his unacceptable all-German committee.<note n="2" xml:id="d461fn2">See <ref target="#d457">Documents 457</ref> and <ref target="#d458">458</ref>.</note> In essence it constitutes a continuing in being of this conference without time limit as at present constituted with German advisers and permitting appointment of Deputies to carry on negotiations. This basic formula is as far as we can go. Neither the West Germans nor we ourselves can contemplate according the <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> the type of recognition inherent in the Soviet proposal. Yesterday <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> of <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss> flatly rejected our formulation and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> for all practical purposes did the same although he reserved his right to comment definitively after further study of our proposal.</p>
<p>In light <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s continuing insistence we accept his all-German committee concept as condition precedent even to any further discussion interim Berlin arrangement. We face complete impasse unless <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> abandons his insistence on link between two problems or recedes from his all-German position sufficiently to accept our formulation or some variant of it which would still preserve our essentials on this point.</p>
<p>Of course even if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> should shift his position on the all-German committee the negotiation on Berlin is still in a completely unsatisfactory position. As you will recall <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> since we returned to Geneva has repeatedly refused to answer our questions concerning the position of our rights at the end of any agreed interim period. His “Foreign Minister to Foreign Minister” assurance to me at my lunch with him Saturday is of course worthless.<note n="3" xml:id="d461fn3">See <ref target="#d455">Document 455</ref>.</note> Moreover apart from the question of rights he has given no indication of agreeing with any of our other basic positions on Berlin other than the continued arming of our garrisons only with conventional weapons.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1023" n="1023" facs="1048"/>
<p>Under these circumstances I plan if you approve to say to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> privately in the next day or two after informing <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> that in light his attitudes end of road for this conference now clearly in sight and ask his views on how we can quickly bring sterile meeting to adjournment in fashion which would minimize resultant and inevitable increase in tensions. If in fact Soviet position adamant then I consider it in our interests to move rapidly to orderly conclusion. In self-respect we cannot continue this performance indefinitely and to do so for more than a few more days in conference’s existing posture carries in my judgment serious risk that Soviets will interpret our inexhaustible patience as evidence of weakness and anxiety. On other hand if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is maintaining stonewall attitude for tactical reasons my contemplated approach to him would I believe be equally well designed to produce some movement on his part. Germans and French I am sure will enthusiastically support such an initiative by me. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> will express serious doubts but I do not think that in the end he will oppose it.</p>
<p>I recognize complication in timing of my proposed approach to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Vice President’s trip.<note n="4" xml:id="d461fn4">For documentation on the Vice President’s visit to Moscow to open the U.S. exhibit at the Sokolniki Fair, see vol. X, Part 1, <ref target="#d92">Documents 92</ref> ff.</note> However if we do not make some such move promptly I believe <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is likely to stall here until after Vice President’s departure from Russia in belief <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> despite public statements to contrary will in fact bear message from you affecting proceedings here. My approach to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> I believe could be usefully reinforced by Vice President in first substantive discussion with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> impressing on him firmness of our position and seriousness of our intent to wind up conference if present Soviet positions at Geneva are in fact their last words.</p>
<p>Needless to say if this combined approach produces no change in present Soviet position we will have no choice but to recess or terminate this conference with consequent effect on prospects of a summit conference and over British misgivings or objection. Subject of summit incidentally had never come up here in any discussions with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your guidance.</p>
<p>Faithfully yours, Chris.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 373. Embassies Moscow, Paris, London, Bonn—eyes only Ambassador. US Mission Berlin—eyes only <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName>. Subject: Private Session.</p>
<p>In almost two hour discussion after <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s luncheon today, Foreign Ministers went over much the same ground as that covered in yesterday’s private session. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> again argued that Western proposal is not prejudicial to either side’s position on responsibility for reunification, but had no visible effect on <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. As at last session, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> underlined the significance of last sentence of Western proposal as insuring possibility of procedural experiments for discussion of all aspects of German problem (contacts, reunification, peace treaty, European security) which could be stressed include negotiating procedures along lines of Soviet proposal for certain of these aspects if both German parties agreed. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued adamant in his insistence that reunification could not be responsibility of four powers but must be reserved exclusively for all-German negotiations free of outside control or supervision. While he again called upon Western Foreign Ministers to suggest alternative proposals for Soviet consideration, it was clear from his remarks that such proposals to be acceptable must embrace Soviet concept of all-German responsibility for reunification problem.</p>
<p>Only new element to emerge from this afternoon’s discussion was shift in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s previous position that discussion of all-German negotiations must precede consideration of other issues before conference (meaning Berlin). He now agrees to suspend consideration of German negotiations question and to discuss in “parallel manner” Berlin problem, but insists on returning to former question in due course. Despite persistent probing by the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> refused to make clear whether Soviet position now is that achievement of settlement on Berlin problem must be preceded by agreement on all-German negotiations question. The Secretary, seconded by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, put following specific question to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>: “Can we infer from your remarks that no agreement is possible on Berlin problem without prior concurrence in Soviet demand that arrangements be made for negotiations between <pb xml:id="pg_1025" n="1025" facs="1050"/>two German states?” <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that this may be Western interpretation of his remarks, for which he could not be held responsible; the Soviet position was as he had expressed it.</p>
<p>After <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had resorted several times to these exasperating evasive tactics, Secretary said he saw little purpose in entering into discussion of Berlin question if on termination thereof <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would then revert to insistence on Western agreement with Soviet position on reunification question before concluding interim settlement of Berlin problem. In short, Secretary said, perhaps we better agree to disagree. When pressed by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> as to whether this also <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s position, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> merely replied this was Secretary’s comment, not his.</p>
<p>At one point in conversation, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, questioned by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, said that if under Soviet proposal no agreement on reunification reached by Germans at end of prescribed time limit then four powers would meet to discuss peace treaty with two German states. He made clear that if German negotiations produced no formula for reunification within time limit, further discussion of reunification would be useless and world would be obliged to recognize permanent existence of two German states. The Secretary commented that, since there is no possibility that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would ever agree to free elections, Soviet formula would thus consign Germans to permanent division of their country without giving them any opportunity to express their wishes in the matter.</p>
<p>At <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s request, Foreign Ministers will meet at plenary session tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 165. For the Secretary from the President.</p>
<p>“July 21, 1959</p>
<p>Dear Chris:</p>
<p>Thank you for your report.<note n="1" xml:id="d464fn1">See <ref target="#d461">Document 461</ref>.</note> You certainly are having an unproductive and difficult time with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. I quite agree that this cannot continue for long. However, I do feel that if we take any action to terminate things this week it would inescapably transfer the burden of negotiation to the Vice President during his meeting with the Soviets over the coming weekend. I see no reason on the other hand why you should not tell <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> privately, as I gather you have already intimated to him, that unless the negotiations begin to show more progress in the near future it will not be possible to continue. A two or three days’ recess might possibly <pb xml:id="pg_1027" n="1027" facs="1052"/>serve to indicate publicly that we are considering terminating the farce. I have just been informed that <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> has been in touch with <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and apparently has some information to convey. Maybe this will have some bearing on our decision. In any event we should see things more clearly in about a week.</p>
<p>I thought your statement yesterday was excellent.</p>
<p>P.S.: I have just seen Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> who has verbally given me a rough translation of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s reply to my letter which was carried to him by Koslov.<note n="2" xml:id="d464fn2">A more detailed record of <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>’s meeting with the President at 6:45 p.m. is in <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library, <persName corresp="#p_WAC1">Whitman</persName> File, DDE Diaries. A draft of the President’s letter and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s reply, July 21, are printed in vol. X, Part 1, <ref target="#d89">Documents 89</ref> and <ref target="#d91">91</ref>.</note> The greater part of the letter is an expression of readiness and even a keen desire to exchange visits. He indicated he would prefer that his visit here should take place after the termination of the hottest part of our weather. However, when he discussed the condition I laid down—namely that there should be some degree of progress at Geneva which would justify a Summit meeting, he simply played the same old record. He thinks there is no virtue in our arguing that without such progress, meetings at the highest level would have no reason and no beneficial result.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the State Department will make a careful translation of the letter and we will start drafting a reply which will, of course, be sent to you for comment before dispatching. We will send it through <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>, but <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> will be provided a copy.</p>
<p>Incidentally, in discussing a possible visit here, he mentioned a period of some ten to fifteen days and observed that it would make little difference to him whether the visit was formal or informal.</p>
<p>As of this moment no real progress is observable.</p>
<p>I think it is important that this whole matter be kept confidential for the time being.</p>
<p>With best regard,</p>
<p>D.E.”</p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> attacked linkage too, and found no comfort in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s remarks today re what would happen after interim Berlin arrangement.</p>
<p>Next meeting plenary July 23, 3:30 p.m. <hi rend="italic">End summary.</hi></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stressed need for “two German states” coming together (I) to reach agreed German viewpoint re peace treaty, for which four powers bear main responsibility; (II) to discuss unity, which could not be achieved in any other way; (III) to promote inter-German contacts on more than technical problems. Attacked Western proposal for continuing <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> conference with German advisers, as involving procedure for four power dictation to Germans on German questions, and as being put forward merely to evade discussion of Soviet proposal. Soviets still hope some method acceptable inter-German discussion can be found, e.g., two German Delegations could begin their contacts at this conference and try to agree on future procedures. Proposals of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> at last plenary<note n="3" xml:id="d465fn3">See <ref target="#d458">Document 458</ref>.</note> are sufficiently elastic to create other possibilities, etc. While seeking agreed method of inter-German discussion, four powers could conduct parallel discussion of interim Berlin arrangements to clarify difficulties, possibilities of agreement and to realize such possibilities.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1029" n="1029" facs="1054"/>
<p>Then said, referring past <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> questions, that during interim agreement on Berlin and during negotiations at Foreign Ministers conference following agreement, Soviets would take no unilateral action if Western powers observed agreement.</p>
<p>Secretary gave prepared statement attacking Soviet proposals for linkage between German committee’s consideration of German unification and interim Berlin arrangement.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> also attacked relating discussion of all-German question to that of Berlin arrangement, since measures addressed to German question could not be tied to Berlin measures.

<p>[Here follow three paragraphs discussing various aspects of the Vice President’s trip to Moscow; for text, see volume X, Part 1, <ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.]</p>
<p>The President then described the note he had received from <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d466fn1">See <ref target="#d464">Document 464</ref>.</note> last evening. In his own letter, delivered to Kozlov, the President suggested that if things go well at Geneva, a personal exchange prior to a Summit Meeting might be useful. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s reply had <pb xml:id="pg_1030" n="1030" facs="1055"/>allowed no link between results at Geneva and a Summit Meeting. The President advised Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, however, that he need not take this matter up unless <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> does so himself. The President calculates that the answer to the Kozlov note will not arrive in Moscow before Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> because he is studying the matter rather carefully prior to writing. It may arrive before Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> leaves. He then read his draft reply to the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> letter in its present form.<note n="2" xml:id="d466fn2">Presumably an earlier draft of the reply referred to in <ref target="#d477fn4">footnote 4, Document 477</ref>.</note></p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asked if the President desires to link the idea of exchange of visits with the idea of a Summit Meeting. The President said it was more important to link exchange of visits with progress at Geneva and agreed that the prospect of exchange visits is being used as a prod, to progress at Geneva. The President’s initial idea had been to meet with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> now to prod the foreign ministers. However, this had been discouraged by his advisors. He told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that he could stress the adverse psychological effects in the United States of any scheme whereby the President would appear to go to a Summit Meeting under ultimatum.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> then requested guidance in the event <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> asks for the President’s definition of the word “progress.” The President said progress would mean assurance of our rights in Berlin, plus the setting up of machinery to study the overall problem. He admitted that this machinery could be amorphous in nature. As an example of the kind he has in mind, the President cited our proposal for a continuation of the meeting of the foreign offices with German advisors. This could be set up by the Foreign Ministers and confirmed that he would like to find soon a reasonable excuse for a Summit Meeting.</p>

<item>Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName></item>
<item>General <persName corresp="#p_GBGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName></item>
</list>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> came in to discuss with the President the latter’s draft of a reply to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d467fn1">See <ref target="#d466fn2">footnote 2, Document 466</ref>.</note> concerning the possibility of <pb xml:id="pg_1031" n="1031" facs="1056"/>an exchange of visits by him and the President. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented that the draft implied that the same preconditions existed for a meeting of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> with the President as for a summit meeting. The President said this was automatic since his invitation had made such a visit incident to a summit meeting in Quebec.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said he had not understood that the two questions were tied together in this way and that in fact what had been conveyed to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was an unqualified invitation. The President was extremely disturbed about this. He recalled that he had wanted to have <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> make a quick visit right away, using as the basis a visit to his exhibition in New York, with a day or two of informal discussions thereafter; this would have occurred at a time prior to knowing the outcome of the Geneva discussions, and would have been independent of their success or failure. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and the State Department people had, however, said that it would help to obtain results at Geneva if the invitation were now issued, and he recalled clearly that it was tied to a Quebec meeting. He said that someone had failed to bring clearly to his attention that the invitation was being extended on some other basis.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said he by no means believed that failure at the Geneva conference is certain. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said there has not been enough time for a decision by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in light of the President’s invitation to get to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Geneva and reorient his stand.</p>
<p>The President said very strongly that we have insisted throughout that we would not have a summit meeting without progress at the Foreign Ministers meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said the holding of a summit meeting is still conditioned on such progress. However, he felt that the United States would get a lot of credit if the President were to see <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> even without progress at Geneva. In fact, he felt that such a meeting would “bring along” summit prospects.</p>
<p>The President said he just did not see how he could have <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in the United States for ten days if there has been a break-down at Geneva. The President said that a two-day session at Camp David before the final outcome of the Geneva conference was known is one thing, and a ten-day visit under such circumstances is quite another. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> repeated that he thought there was a good chance that we would accomplish something at Geneva.</p>
<p>The President said, in response to a comment by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> that the Soviets may permit the factual situation in Berlin to remain “unchanged,” that it will take more than that to warrant a summit meeting. We must have some kind of four-power arrangement relating to German reunification. He said he is staggered by the situation now presented to him, since he had had no thought of having an unqualified invitation extended to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He reverted to the point that he had thought of a different sequence of events, and in fact had asked the State <pb xml:id="pg_1032" n="1032" facs="1057"/>people to study most carefully the factor of timing. It was a surprise to him that his concept on safeguarding the invitation had not been observed.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> suggested it is too soon to know just where we stand as regards an answer to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. We need at least a few more days to let the matter “play out.” The President showed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> a draft he proposed to send to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>;<note n="2" xml:id="d467fn2">The President’s draft has not been found; for the agreed text as sent to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, see <ref target="#d468">Document 468</ref>.</note> he felt some response was necessary because of the overly optimistic tone of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s message<note n="3" xml:id="d467fn3"><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s message was delivered to the President during the morning of July 22 and a copy was given to <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> in Geneva at 4:30 p.m. the same day. In the ten-paragraph message <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> stated that the negotiations in Geneva seemed to be going ahead “fairly steadily” and offered two suggestions to the Vice President for dealing with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. (Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> with US Officials)</note> of suggestions for the Vice President. There was agreement that the rather somber tone of the President’s note to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was appropriate.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> showed the President an alternative draft of a response to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on which some preliminary work had been done in the State Department.<note n="4" xml:id="d467fn4">Not found.</note> The President said it all boiled down to the fact that in light of the unqualified invitation that had been given, he would have to pay the penalty and hold a meeting he despised. In considering the matter further, he noted that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had stressed that a great reception would be prepared for President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in Russia. He thought he could make the point that he cannot order such a reception on the part of our people as can <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> on the part of his. However, if the Geneva negotiations show some progress he would be able to evoke a fine reception for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. He was thinking of a passage to the effect that if he and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could meet in an atmosphere improved by clear evidence of some progress in easing world tensions, that would be far more fruitful in promoting the mutual understanding we seek than in the absence of such demonstrated improvement; and that so far as our own people are concerned, the President could not emphasize too strongly how hopefully they would look at a meeting between himself and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> if some such prior improvement had been clearly accomplished. The President said, however, that these developments leave him with a question in his mind as to just what purpose it is now felt that a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would serve. He recalled that he had been trying to use such a meeting to get something accomplished at Geneva.</p>

<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said he would try to drive home with <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName>, when the two of them meet, the need for some progress at Geneva.<note n="5" xml:id="d467fn5"><persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> talked with <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> the evening of July 23 and emphasized to him that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s visit to the United States would take place in a much more favorable climate if “reasonable progress could be achieved at Geneva.” (<gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 188 to Geneva, July 24; Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1333)</note></p>
<p>The President said he also had on his mind the question as to what we would tell our allies in justification of such a meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented that it would not be a negotiating meeting like a four-power session, but would be to clarify our respective positions.</p>
<p>The President commented that he was troubled by the handling of this matter. He recalled that he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had always talked from ideas or topics and not from papers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> would then put on paper the idea upon which they had agreed and send it to the President to correct and confirm.</p>
<p>The President asked for a draft that would bring out clearly the position of the State Department that progress at Geneva is not essential to a meeting of himself with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, but that such progress would bring about a much more effective visit. This draft should make clear that he has asked <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to come and talk and see our country, and that he would be asking for the courtesy of our people. It must be clear that he is not revoking his invitation. We will continue to stand completely firm regarding a summit meeting; this will be a question of the two getting together for exploratory talks.</p>

<p>“July 22, 1959</p>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName>:</p>
<p>Thank you so much for sending me, for the benefit of the Vice President, some of your impressions concerning Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. Dick came in to pay a farewell call on me a little while ago,<note n="2" xml:id="d468fn2">See <ref target="#d466">Document 466</ref>.</note> before departing for Moscow, and he read your memorandum. I am certain he will express his personal appreciation to you at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>From the tone of your message, I would conclude that you are much more hopeful than I am of any worthwhile result at Geneva. Unless there is an abrupt reversal in the Soviet attitude, it would appear to me that the accomplishment will be zero, or even a minus. I think that the only bright spot in the exercise has been the solidarity of the West on basic issues.</p>
<p>As you know, I have been quite ready to interpret progress in a most liberal fashion. So long as we could have the assurance of complete respect of our rights in Berlin and there could be agreed any kind of program that could be presented by the Foreign Ministers to Heads of Government for study and discussion, our own minimum criteria for the holding of such a meeting would be realized. Unless there is at least this much justification for a Summit, it is still my conviction that such a meeting would be a fraud on our peoples and a great diplomatic blunder.</p>
<p>I know that there has been some argument that the less the progress at the Foreign Ministers level, the more necessary a Summit meeting becomes. I am quite clear in my mind that such a feeling is not shared by the bulk of our people.</p>
<p>This may sound to you overly pessimistic. But you know that I have very much wanted to participate in a meeting in which there was even the slightest promise of a successful outcome. No one would be more thankful than I if my evaluation of the final Geneva outcome should be <pb xml:id="pg_1035" n="1035" facs="1060"/>demonstrated wrong. But I am trying to be realistic, based on what we know of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and his henchmen.</p>
<p>With warm regard,</p>
<p>As ever, Ike”</p>
<p>Observe Presidential handling.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item><gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Views on Berlin</item>
</list>
<p>1. On July 18 Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> telegraphed the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on a possible Berlin proposal to Assistant Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName>, who is the Defense representative on the Geneva delegation, and instructed him to present them to the Secretary for possible use at the Conference.</p>
<p>2. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposes that the West should put forward “an initial demand for transferring to the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Germany a 100 mile-wide land and air corridor between Helmstedt and Berlin. Negotiating range would be between this demand and a final fallback position of a 60-mile-wide corridor, with control of Western traffic vested in the Western Allies”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName> said he believed “that this proposal has considerable merit since it permits the West to take the initiative, and, if properly exploited, places us in a most favorable light in the forum of public opinion, regardless of the Soviet reaction.” (A copy of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal is attached at Tab A.)<note n="1" xml:id="d469fn1">Not printed.</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1036" n="1036" facs="1061"/>
<p>3. The proposal of a land corridor to Berlin under West German sovereignty was carefully considered by the planners in December and January. (It was often combined with the proposal that Berlin be made into an eleventh Land of the Federal Republic.) These proposals were not incorporated in the Western plans because it was considered that they were so obviously non-negotiable. (In this connection it should be noted that the 100-mile corridor to Berlin the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposes would include about one-fourth of East Germany.) Although such a notion has been advocated by various people in the United States, it was never seriously discussed in Germany because it did not seem sufficiently realistic. Such a possibility was barely mentioned in the German press. In our opinion, it would be quite out of keeping with the development of the Conference and the Western approach to introduce such an idea at this stage.</p>
<p>4. I have written a letter of acknowledgment to General Guthrie who sent me a copy of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNH1">McElroy</persName>’s message.</p>
<p>5. In my opinion the delegation in Geneva is fully equipped to deal with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal since it includes members who went through all of the Working Group exercises in which similar ideas were considered and rejected.</p>

Reference: <gloss target="#t_ourtel1">Ourtel</gloss> 37 to Geneva, 95 Bonn, 102 Department.<note n="1" xml:id="d470fn1">Telegram 37, July 21, reported that <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> himself wanted to brief the three Berlin Commandants on the results of the Berlin Senat meeting on July 18. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.0221/7–2159)</note> At informal meeting with Commandants and Deputy Commandants convened at his request, Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> presented at behest of Senat lucid statement of Senat’s concern over extent to which Senat considered Western powers had departed from stand on Berlin taken in November <pb xml:id="pg_1037" n="1037" facs="1062"/>and December and over apparent deterioration in Western determination to resist Soviet pressures. <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName>’s statement clearly the most pessimistic evaluation so far made officially even though couched in polite and reserved phraseology. Senator <persName corresp="#p_KG1">Klein</persName> told me personally Sunday morning that Saturday’s Senat meeting was “gloomy” session.<note n="2" xml:id="d470fn2">In telegram 113, July 22, <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> reported that the outlook of Berlin’s political and other leaders had reached the “gloomiest level since Berlin crisis began last November.” He also noted that several observers who had returned to the city after prolonged absences were impressed by the decline in morale in the city. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762A.00/7–2259)</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> statement follows in summary form:</p>
<p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName>, speaking in English, stated he wished to inform Commandants of conclusions drawn by Senat in Saturday meeting during which Senat reviewed events since November and Geneva outlook, Senat confirmed stand taken in November that ultimatum must be withdrawn and that no concessions should be made without concessions in return. Senat wished Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> to emphasize to Commandants desire of Senat to maintain this strong position, particularly now when “some other opinions” are being revealed at Geneva. Geneva has left impression that Western position had deviated from the one unanimously accepted at beginning of crisis. In admittedly cautious statement <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> said June 16 proposals went “a little beyond” limit Senat would have approved and Senat would have made its objections known if consulted beforehand.</p>
<p>In commenting specifically on June 16 proposals, <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> said he was surprised to read that Western powers would be willing accept agent theory which would have been discarded months ago. Regarding Western proposal to agree no nuclear weapons in Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> said this understandable proposal but Senat hopes that price will be required from other side for any such concession. He referred to views already expressed by <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> on limitation or reduction size Allied troops and called attention to fact that Senat has good evidence that a policy paper prepared by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authorities includes plans for Soviet Zone German Communist directed and manned “revolts” in West Berlin which will have as targets police stations, radio transmitters, city hall, etc. Therefore certain number of Western troops vital to maintain public order. Proposals on prohibition certain activities in Berlin difficult carry out without jeopardizing constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Regarding second phase Geneva <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in proposing all-German committee maintained that Berlin problem cannot be separated from all-German problem. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> now gives appearance of having accepted original Western opinion, whereas Allies have only discussed interim Berlin solution. <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> agreed it necessary <pb xml:id="pg_1038" n="1038" facs="1063"/>to come to some interim agreement on Berlin to give time to discuss all-German problem. As indicative of change in atmosphere of discussion at Geneva which has caused Senat alarm, Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> cited recent article in <hi rend="italic">Le Monde</hi>, reflecting semi-official view, which stated that Berlin is untenable and must be sold to Russians as expensively as possible and that Allies should facilitate evacuation of Berliners wanting to leave and construct “Chinese wall” along the Iron Curtain. (French Commandant afterwards explained that <hi rend="italic">Le Monde</hi> not semi-official mouthpiece but that regrettably many were under impression it is.)</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> then presented certain principles which in Senat view are essential: (1) West should not offer any concession without demanding counter-concessions. <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> suggested that weakness of June 16 proposals lay in fact that West did not say to Russians if you prepared grant free access, recognition Allied rights Berlin, ties of Berlin with <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>, etc. (matters on which no concession by West should be made), we will discuss problem of limitation of troops, etc. (2) No solution should be acceptable in which date of expiration fixed short of reunification. As long as time period fixed, Russian threat to Berlin kept alive and Berlin remains hostage for Russian demands. (3) Any form of recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> cannot be considered. No steps should be taken towards recognition or towards formation all-German committee. (<persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> cited, as type of occurrence causing “sorrow” among colleagues, a July 20 London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> article reporting <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> attempt persuade <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> that <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> should agree, to some form East-West German talks.) Senat realizes certain technical conversations necessary of type already carried on (e.g. commercial talks); <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName>’s proposal of inter-administrative commission provides for discussion between experts but only under responsibility four powers. (4) Because of impossibility of reaching agreed basis for restricting certain activities involving public media of expression, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control would not be practicable.</p>
<p>Senat colleagues, Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> revealed, alarmed pver fact that, because in second phase Geneva West started from June 16 proposals and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> proposed all-German committee, a new compromise would be required going beyond June 16 proposals. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> tried to calm colleagues by saying compromise might be sought on another plane by West’s proposing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control of traffic to Berlin. This would be consistent with Senat contention that any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> involvement should be additional to, and not supplant, Allied rights and responsibilities. Any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control should be exercised by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s own officials rather than by representatives of other countries.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1039" n="1039" facs="1064"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> stressed importance of avoiding unclear formulations in any possible agreement, citing as example that should West agree accept <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> personnel as agents in “control” of access, “control” must be clearly defined as it has not been so far.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> confirmed that Senat paper on proposals for improvement in access field under preparation. Since proposals technical in nature and therefore not appropriate for discussion on <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> level, they will not be forwarded to conference. Discussions on proposals will continue with <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> representatives and paper will be readied for possible future need. <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> also touched on relationship Berlin to <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. Senat is of opinion that integration of Berlin into <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> must continue in the future but main problem presently is that measure of integration already achieved be maintained. Small Senat committee will begin discussions in fall on problem of strengthening Berlin-<gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> relations. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> also remarked that Berlin population remains calm and trusts fully in its own moral force and in protection of Allied authorities.</p>
<p>In closing, <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> stressed again Senat’s hopes that policy of November-December will be continued and that West will remain as firm and strong as possible.</p>

<p rend="sectiontitleital">Conference Tactics</p>
<p>1. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> has informed the Secretary that he wants to make a major speech today. The Secretary indicated that he would like to have a contingency statement available for his use.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1040" n="1040" facs="1065"/>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> thought it important that Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> be up-to-date on the present status of the question of the future of our rights in Berlin when he sees <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, particularly in view of recent <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statements. To this end, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> has drafted a telegram which he said would be brought to the Secretary for approval. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> cautioned that we must not fall into the trap of accepting the idea that a separate Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> peace treaty would wipe out our rights. We must continue to maintain that any unilateral action does not affect our rights. The Secretary said he strongly agreed. (See <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 164 attached.)<note n="1" xml:id="d471fn1"><ref target="#d473">Document 473</ref>.</note></p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he was also concerned with the danger of agreeing to a reciprocal freezing of actions concerning Berlin—a point which <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> twice has mentioned. This would give the Soviets a convenient escape-hatch because almost any action we took relating to Germany could be used by them as a pretext for denouncing an agreement.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> questioned the advisability of asking for a unilateral Soviet declaration that our rights would be maintained during a specified period. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> thought such a unilateral declaration unnecessary and dangerous, since it could leave the implication that our rights would be changed at the end of the specified period. In this connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> called attention to the “valuable” statement by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> yesterday that any agreement presupposed no unilateral action on either side. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> indicated that a separate understanding on this point was unnecessary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> added that we want a reaffirmation of our rights, for otherwise our position legally, psychologically and politically will be weaker in several years. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJN1">Irwin</persName> favored returning to the specific language in our June 16 proposal. Summing up, the Secretary said that we must be clear precisely what we want. We must stick to one formula and not be introducing variations.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Berlin Trip</p>
<p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that a draft speech had been prepared for the Secretary’s use on his visit to Berlin Saturday. The Secretary said that he preferred that Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> not ride on the plane with him from Geneva. He would rather devote time for a talk with <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> while in Berlin.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Meeting with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName></p>
<p>3. The Secretary said that he would meet with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> tomorrow to discuss certain bilateral subjects.<note n="2" xml:id="d471fn2"><persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> met at 4 p.m. to discuss atomic testing and disarmament. The U.S. Delegation reported on this meeting in <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 168 from Geneva, July 23. (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss>.1329)</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1041" n="1041" facs="1066"/>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Press Developments</p>
<p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said that Soviet spokesman <persName corresp="#p_KMA1">Kharlamov</persName> was asked last night what would happen if agreement were reached on only one issue while parallel talks on Berlin and the all-German issue were being held, as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had proposed. <persName corresp="#p_KMA1">Kharlamov</persName> reportedly replied that the two issues were “irrevocably linked.”</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> noted that <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> did not give great play to the article alleging State-Defense differences in our negotiating position.<note n="3" xml:id="d471fn3">Reference is to an article entitled “The Pentagon and Softness,” which appeared in <hi rend="italic">Newsweek, July 22, 1959.</hi></note></p>
<p>Correspondents in Geneva have apparently been receiving from British sources indications that we are adopting different attitudes from the British—that we want to break off the talks while the British do not; that we react in a harder manner to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s negotiating statements than the British; and that we got ourselves on a hook by stating that the conference was approaching its end unless <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> showed a better attitude. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> said he was trying to find the source of these reports. The Secretary commented that <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> always wanted to be optimistic. He added that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> has behaved extremely well as regards tripartite cooperation here.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Begin summary</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> opened by outlining West’s objections to Soviet all-German committee proposal.<note n="1" xml:id="d472fn1">For text of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s statement and the other statements summarized below, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 470–485, 560, and 596–598 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd</hi>. 868, pp. 298–309 and 346–349.</note> Believed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement of yesterday had confirmed <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s understanding re situation at end interim period and during any subsequent negotiations but had not dealt with situation at end these negotiations. Thought interim plan for Berlin now sketched out and agreement possible here or elsewhere. Urged <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reconsider West’s July 20 proposal.</p>
<p>After Secretary’s statement (<gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 384)<note n="2" xml:id="d472fn2"><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 384, July 23, transmitted the text of <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>’s statement. (Department of State, Central Files, 396.1–GE/7–2359)</note> <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> also attacked all-German committee and supported Western proposal. Stressed in reply to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s contention that reunification problem is one for Germans themselves to work out, that peace plan does in fact leave question to Germans in last analysis.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then accused West of lack of objectivity toward all-German committee proposal and of obstructing conference. Said Soviets willing discuss anytime other questions re Berlin “in parallel” with all-German committee proposal.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName> spoke along familiar lines in favor of negotiations between two Germanies and attacked <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> for policy of “force” and “militarism”. <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> denied <persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName>’s allegations.</p>
<p>Time of next plenary meeting to be decided later. (Following adjournment it was agreed to have private luncheon meeting tomorrow at Villa Greta.) <hi rend="italic">End summary.</hi></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> listed Western objections to all-German committee as: a) would end four power responsibility for settlement German problem which necessary if reunification to be achieved; b) provides no incentives to <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> to make concessions since it would obtain recognition in event of deadlock; c) really provides for <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>-Soviet negotiations without US, UK and France since <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> under complete Soviet control. Stressed necessity for free all-German elections. Traced progress negotiations to date. Thought interim agreement re Berlin now sketched out and though <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had confirmed yesterday his (<persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s) understanding that Soviet position is that at end interim period if no agreement reached, negotiations would be resumed by present Geneva conferees, and, pending results these negotiations, the situation re Berlin would remain unaltered with neither side taking any unilateral action. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> noted there is further point as to what happens at end these further negotiations and denied categorically that anything he had said <pb xml:id="pg_1043" n="1043" facs="1068"/>implied he agreed Soviets have any right take unilateral action re Berlin at any time. Concluded as noted in summary above.</p>
<p>After Secretary’s statement <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> also attacked all-German committee proposal, noting especially it designed promote recognition <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and would make reunification impossible since the two negotiating parties speak entirely different languages. Pointed out differences between all-German committee and peace plan’s mixed committee. Soviet plan provides no recourse if two Germanies do not agree but peace plan leaves final decision to German people as a whole through free elections.</p>
<p>In addition points noted in summary above, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> denied <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s allegation <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> policy dictated from Moscow and said socialist countries rejoice in unity of purpose in their foreign policies which work for peace and in their common Communist internal organization. Sarcastically hoped Secretary’s fear <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> would be communized not based on flimsiness <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> Government. Reiterated aims Soviet Government stated by its representatives, not foreigners who interviewed them. Agreed with <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> German reunification was for Germans to decide and noted Soviets had departed from this view by allowing four powers to assist them in solving problem.</p>
<p>Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had misinterpreted his statement re fear of communizing of <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. Recalled he had said <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would never allow reunification unless <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> went Communist. The basic weakness exists not in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> but in East German camp where people not allowed express selves in free elections.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BL1">Bolz</persName>, after alleging all Germans favor negotiations between two Germanies who are represented on equal basis in Geneva, accused Bonn of desiring use force to bring about reunification. Denied <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> desired communization <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> and stated Germans wish avoid imposition on them of “revanchist” <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> regime. Denied <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s allegation re subservience to USSR and, re elections, asked what would be result in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> of plebiscite re socialization and re <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> proposals on elections which made before <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> joined <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and introduced universal military service.

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 164. For <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> from the Secretary. Your <gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 171.<note n="1" xml:id="d473fn1">See the source note, <ref target="#d468">Document 468</ref>.</note> Message sent by President to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> states minimum terms on which we would have to agree here before Presidential agreement to a summit. However, not clear just what words “complete respect of our rights in Berlin” mean. Believe it important obtain clarification this point. Also important that <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> be advised our thinking against the possibility that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> raises this issue. All of following <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> since we do not expect him to initiate discussion this subject.</p>
<p>In our June 16 offer to Soviets, no reference was made to rights, as such. Following phraseology was used:</p>
<list><item>“They [the Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]<note n="2" xml:id="d473fn2">Brackets in the source text.</note> agreed that the best solution for these problems would be the reunification of Germany. They recognized, nowever, that, pending reunification, the existing situation and the agreements at present in force can be modified in certain respect and have consequently agreed upon the following: . . .”<note n="3" xml:id="d473fn3">Ellipsis in the source text.</note></item></list>
<p>Later in our June 16 offer it was stated:</p>
<list><item>“The Ministers agreed that unless subsequently modified by Four Power agreement these arrangements will continue in force until the reunification of Germany.”</item></list>
<p>There is no need that our rights be explicitly reaffirmed. These rights, which on a number of occasions have been recognized by the USSR as legitimate in origin and continuing in fact, derive from the war and from solemn postwar agreements ratified by the USSR. Nothing that the USSR is now being asked to state or do would add to or detract from these rights or from Soviet responsibilities. The only thing that is contemplated at this time is the modification of the agreements spelling out how these rights are to be exercised. Accordingly, under the formulation we are proposing, our rights will continue to exist even after a failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference contemplated at the expiration of any time period agreed for an interim solution of Berlin.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1045" n="1045" facs="1070"/>
<p>Our present thinking of how to present at least initially such a time period is to add to the second paragraph quoted above the sentence:</p>
<list><item>“These arrangements can be reviewed at any time after blank years, if such review is requested by any of the Four rowers.”</item></list>
<p>This formulation of the time period would also leave our rights unaffected.</p>
<p>In summary, we here believe that it should be clearly understood that no arrangements or agreements which may be reached here shall be construed as affecting or modifying in any way the existing rights and obligations of the Four Powers in and relating to Berlin, except as specifically agreed by the Four Powers. Since these rights rest upon their own bottom, they will continue unaffected by the arrangements we propose, except to the extent that we are revising the agreements specifying how they are to be exercised. This, it should be noted, does not constitute a request on our part that the Soviets “perpetuate” our rights. They are not being asked to “reaffirm” the rights for the simple reason that such reaffirmation is not requisite to the continuing validity of the rights.</p>
<p>We also believe it important that the Vice President before talking with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has latest understanding how this matter stands, particularly in light <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement yesterday that USSR would take no unilateral action during term any agreement on Berlin or during negotiations thereafter. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s formulation, you will note, is no concession, because he leaves open question of what will happen if negotiations fail and by implication he is reserving right to take unilateral action, e.g., separate peace treaty with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, in that eventuality. We regard it as essential that in any agreement on Berlin we obtain the language quoted in second paragraph of this telegram.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 183. For the Secretary. Last evening we had a talk with the President<note n="1" xml:id="d474fn1">See <ref target="#d467">Document 467</ref>.</note> regarding the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit. We found him affected by certain anxieties, part of which concerned his thought of replying to <pb xml:id="pg_1046" n="1046" facs="1071"/><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s letter and in effect saying that both the summit meeting as well as the personal visit are conditioned on “noticeable progress” at the Foreign Ministers Meeting. We had to point out that the invitation extended to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> via Kozlov did not specify such a condition for the personal visit. The President was surprised and insisted at first that he had understood that it was so conditioned. We referred to the talking paper<note n="2" xml:id="d474fn2">Not further identified.</note> which he had approved and in which he had in fact made some changes at the time in the language. After reviewing the paper it was evident to him that no such condition had been stated, although obviously there is a relationship between the personal visit and an eventual summit conference. He seemed to feel that under the circumstances, such a personal visit by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to this country without minimum progress at Geneva might be badly received.</p>
<p>After threshing this about for a time, a calmer view prevailed. It was agreed that we would take a few days in which to prepare a reply on the understanding that the invitation to exchange personal visits had been extended and has been accepted.</p>
<p>It seems to us that if the Geneva talks collapse or end futilely and the President has not taken an initiative such as this, a most awkward situation arises. If the talks collapse and he can show he has taken this initiative, his worst enemies would be obliged to admit that he has exhausted every possible means to promote a peaceful solution. Furthermore, the invitation must be viewed in the context of the Geneva talks. We cannot see but what the invitation would have some favorable influence on the Soviet attitude. It is certainly not to be excluded that the invitation might promote the development of a formula in the days ahead which would be considered sufficient progress to justify a summit meeting. Then there is the additional factor of sentiment in this country and in Europe, which has been increasingly vocal in urging that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> be exposed to a greater knowledge of the power and resources of this country. In a way, we are inclined to consider a <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit to this country of greater importance than a 4-power summit meeting. The President could do an effective job on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. There is the added feature that all of this—that is, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s visit here and the President’s visit to the Soviet Union—would take the remaining edge off the crisis created by the Berlin issue, stretching it out and absorbing it in the context of these talks. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would also become more conscious of public opinion in this country and its insistence on progress toward solutions, and perhaps be brought around to understanding the necessity of creating a better atmosphere by permitting a reasonable formula at Geneva prior to his visit to the United States. Against these considerations, <pb xml:id="pg_1047" n="1047" facs="1072"/>the prospect of a collapse of the Geneva talks without adequate results leaves nothing but a rather grim prospect.</p>
<p>The President, we believe, had a better feeling about this after our discussion. We certainly made it clear that the imposition of qualifications or conditions on the invitation to make a personal visit would hardly be wise under the circumstances.</p>
<p>At the close he fully and seemingly enthusiastically agreed to the concept that there should be no condition attached to reciprocal visits. He suggested instead that we find a way to make clear to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that his reception in this country would be much better if there had been progress at Geneva. This is the line we are working on.</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Meeting of the Coordinating Group</item>
</list>
<p>The following were the principal points made at today’s meeting of the Coordinating Group:</p>
<p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GWC1">Grewe</persName> reported on <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName>’s talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> last night. The atmosphere was friendly and not as gloomy as the Germans had expected. Throughout, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was temperate in tone and manner. The conversations produced nothing concrete affecting the progress of the Conference. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> put considerable stress on the Soviet desire to pursue disarmament talks. He asked <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> to put pressure on the Allies to resume these talks. He came back to this point several times, stressing that it was the fault of the Western powers that the talks were not going on. As far as the Geneva Conference itself was concerned, the arguments made were pretty much along conventional lines. <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> took Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kroll</persName> aside at one point and made some obscure and mysterious remarks about how the West Germans would soon regret the policy they were pursuing. They would soon see how the Federal Republic would be completely isolated.</p>
<p>2. After considerable discussion, it was the consensus that, at this afternoon’s private meeting, the Western Ministers should continue to pursue the all-German question, stressing the constructive features in their July 20<note n="1" xml:id="d475fn1">Regarding this proposal, see <ref target="#d465fn1">footnote 1, Document 465</ref>.</note> proposal and the unacceptable features of the all-German committee. However, there would be little point in merely repeating the same arguments made at the Plenary Session unless these seemed pertinent. The Western Ministers should try to make some progress in getting <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to abandon the link between the all-German question and the Berlin question. It would be desirable to avoid getting into any substantive discussion on Berlin today.</p>
<p>3.

<p>At this afternoon’s private meeting the Western Foreign Ministers began by reaffirming the complete unacceptability of the Soviet proposal for an all-German committee and the Soviet effort to link this to an interim Berlin arrangement. But <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> succeeded fairly quickly in focusing the talk on the seven points of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s July 20 speech.<note n="1" xml:id="d476fn1">For text of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s statement on July 20, see <hi rend="italic">Foreign Ministers Meeting</hi>, pp. 444–449 or <hi rend="italic">Cmd</hi>. 868, pp. 280–283.</note> The meeting was characterized by prolonged silences. At one point there was a warm exchange regarding procedure in which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, endeavoring to present himself as the victim of unfair treatment, demanded to be dealt with as an equal. It was quite apparent that he was in no hurry to go anywhere.</p>
<p>The Secretary started the discussion by underlining importance of clarifying relationship between question of all-German negotiations and interim Berlin solution, saying he saw little use in entering into detailed discussion of Berlin problem so long as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> insisted on link. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, supporting Secretary, tried to focus attention on link problem by attempting to draw <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> into debate on question of duration of agreement.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> however would have none of this and insisted on proceeding with discussion on basis of order of items named in <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> speech of July 20 despite <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s pointing out that sequence he used was purely arbitrary and of no significance. Notwithstanding <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s repeated insistence on reaching understanding on troop levels (i.e., <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s first point) before proceeding to discussion of other points, West Foreign Ministers did succeed in focusing some attention on other aspects. As a result following points were brought out:</p>
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">Troop Levels.</hi> <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was told that West considers present troop strength in West Berlin to be symbolic (11–12, 999), but he violently disagreed stating that Soviet requirement for symbolic level could only be met by substantial reduction in present strength, at least 3–4,000 level. The Secretary pointed out that West agreement to limit Berlin <pb xml:id="pg_1050" n="1050" facs="1075"/>troop strength to existing levels represents major concession since West has absolute right to raise troop strength to any level it feels appropriate or desirable.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">2. Armaments</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could not agree with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s impression that agreement already reached on formulation with regard to non-stationing of nuclear and missile weapons. Referring to language of June 16 proposal, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> insisted that reference to type of armaments appears as separate point and be more precisely stated in order to indicate restriction applies to West Berlin only since no Soviet troops in East Berlin. Secretary insisted that if this to be separate item restriction must apply to Berlin as a whole. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made quite an issue of need for isolating armaments as separate item in Berlin agreement, and it was consensus of West Foreign Ministers who exchanged views after <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> left that Soviets intend to exploit West’s agreement to pilot Berlin atom-free zone as significant precedent for Rapacki, Balkan and Baltic zones.</p>
<p>3. <hi rend="italic">Propaganda and Subversive Activities</hi>. Secretary vigorously asserted that West would never agree to restraints on activities in West Berlin except on terms of absolute reciprocity. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> called this unacceptable approach since espionage and subversive activities to which ban would be applied are carried on only in West Berlin; he said agreement to prohibit such activities in East Berlin would simply misrepresent situation since no activity of this sort there. All Western Foreign Ministers sharply rebutted <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> by referring to Secretary’s detailed account in plenary session several weeks ago of espionage, sabotage and other diversionary activities carried on in East Berlin.<note n="2" xml:id="d476fn2">See <ref target="#d367fn1">footnote 1, Document 367</ref>.</note> Despite <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s repeated insistence that there could be no mention of East Berlin, he expressed hope that language could be found which would be mutually acceptable, citing Soviet June 9 formula<note n="3" xml:id="d476fn3">See <ref target="#d377">Document 377</ref>.</note> as model, but he took this attitude only after Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> had reminded him that in discussions of this topic five weeks ago he had apparently agreed to reciprocity.</p>
<p>4. <hi rend="italic">Access.</hi> The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> if he would be prepared to accept idea of four-power commission for settlement access difficulties as recommended in Western June 16 proposal. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied he saw no need for such commission since unlikely any difficulties would arise if agreement reached to maintain “present arrangements” with regard to access.</p>
<p>In sharp exchange with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on reasonableness of attitudes of two sides toward negotiations, Secretary criticized <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> for <pb xml:id="pg_1051" n="1051" facs="1076"/>expecting West to make all the concessions while Soviets unwilling make any. He reminded <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that Berlin crisis is of Soviet origin and since Soviets hold view, which West does not share, that Berlin is danger spot it was up to Soviets to make equal effort in removing source of tensions.</p>
<p>At one point in discussion <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, responding to Secretary’s inquiry, said he had open mind on question of nature of document for possible Berlin agreement; communiqué, recommendations to governments, or formal agreement would be acceptable to him.</p>
<p>It was agreed that Foreign Ministers would meet at <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s Villa for private discussion Monday 5:30 pm. (<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is lunching alone with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> Monday.)</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 169. For the President from the Secretary.</p>
<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>During middle of plenary conference yesterday,<note n="1" xml:id="d477fn1">See <ref target="#d472">Document 472</ref>.</note> <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> sent me some of his thoughts on the present situation here in letter form, and also enclosed a draft of a wire which <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold Macmillan</persName> proposed sending to you, but on which he had first asked for <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>’s views.<note n="2" xml:id="d477fn2">Copies of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s message and the draft wire from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> are attached to US/<gloss target="#t_MC1">MC</gloss>/155 in Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, CF1395. In addition to the sentence quoted, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> explained why the British believed a summit conference was necessary regardless of progress at Geneva.</note> Only the last sentence of <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>’s letter is important and I quote it herewith:</p>
<list><item>‘Furthermore, after what we have done together to try to keep a common position, I dread the possibility of our having to take up different positions in public’.</item></list>
<p>The draft message from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to you was an almost hysterical plea that you yourself call a summit meeting at once to take place in <pb xml:id="pg_1052" n="1052" facs="1077"/>Quebec about September 1, giving quite inaccurately items of progress at the meeting here which would warrant doing this. It was obvious that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s draft had been prepared before receipt of your letter to him dealing with your own views on the summit.<note n="3" xml:id="d477fn3">See <ref target="#d468">Document 468</ref>.</note></p>
<p>I persuaded <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> to dissuade <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName> from sending you such a wire and told him I would wish to discuss the matter with him further today.</p>
<p>After considering overnight and after receipt of two wires from the Department this morning bringing me up to date on the status of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit,<note n="4" xml:id="d477fn4"><gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 183, <ref target="#d474">Document 474</ref>, and <gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 182, July 23, which transmitted the text of a draft reply to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that had been agreed by the President and officers of the Department of State. (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1333)</note> I decided to tell <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> where this matter stood since it, of course, has a real bearing on the various problems surrounding this conference and a possible summit meeting. You will remember that, with your permission, I had advised <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> in very general terms that you had been feeling out informally with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> a possible exchange of visits to Moscow and Washington. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> showed great interest and began at once speculating on how such visits might affect summit. He at first put forward idea possibility your asking <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> to join you for informal talks with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at some time during latter’s visit in U.S. But, after we pointed out the difficulties in arranging this type of informal meeting, he agreed it would probably be impractical. He then speculated on the possibility of your discussing with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> a summit meeting to be held late in November or December after your return from your Moscow visit. He thought possibly having such a summit agreed to in September would take care of both continuing discussions on Berlin and German problems as well as British election problem. He will be talking to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName> over this weekend and may have some thoughts on his return Sunday night.</p>
<p>We both speculated on possible effect contemplated September <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit might have on negotiations here, visualizing two possibilities. First, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would keep <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> inflexible so that he, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, could negotiate directly with you or, second, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would visualize desirability some agreement here in connection with public reception himself in U.S. No conclusion reached.</p>
<p>I am sending to Department some preliminary comments on suggested draft reply to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> which I will expect to supplement early Monday.<note n="5" xml:id="d477fn5">Transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 165, these comments were that 1) the draft should be shortened, 2) the President should not get involved in negotiating over positions at Geneva, 3) the desirability of progress at Geneva if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was to visit the United States, and 4) the exchange of visits should not be linked to a summit meeting. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1329)</note></p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1053" n="1053" facs="1078"/>
<p>I have said nothing whatever to <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> in regard to this whole situation, nor shall I do so until authorized by you. However, if you feel that I could properly give him rough outlines of the situation as it stands, it would be most helpful.</p>
<p>Today’s meeting at my house with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName><note n="6" xml:id="d477fn6">See <ref target="#d476">Document 476</ref>.</note> indicated some little advance on the Berlin problem. All-German committee question shelved by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and we reiterated in private what we had said in public that we would not accept a link between this and a temporary arrangement for Berlin. However, I am certain <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will raise it again, probably in some new form. I feel slightly more optimistic regarding keeping the negotiations going, but there is still a hard row to hoe.</p>
<p>We all await with great interest results of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> talks Sunday.</p>
<p>Faithfully,</p>
<p>Signed: Chris.”</p>

<p>The Foreign Ministers did not meet on either Saturday, July 25, or Sunday, July 26.</p>
<p>Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> took advantage of this break in the meetings to visit Berlin for the dedication of <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName> Allee. During his 6-hour visit on July 25, the Secretary of State reaffirmed the tripartite commitment that had been given to Berlin on October 23, 1954, and reiterated that Western rights in the city could not be terminated unilaterally.

<p>61. Bonn eyes only Ambassador. Urtel 30.<note n="1" xml:id="d479fn1">Telegram 30 to Berlin (<gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 395 from Geneva), July 27, requested a record of this meeting. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 396.1–GE/7–2759)</note> <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> temporarily in <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss> on special business. General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> has given us following which he believes is substance of subjects discussed Saturday morning at Ambassador’s residence.</p>
<p>Secretary started discussion by asking <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> to comment on Russian proposal for reduction of forces. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> answered in substance as follows:</p>
<p>Setting aside all political considerations and admitting that, in event Russian armed forces brought to bear, Allied garrisons in Berlin would be in effect only token force. Overriding reason for not reducing Allied garrisons Berlin is effect such a reduction would have on our ability to cope with large civil disturbances. We know that East German regime backed by Soviets capable of instigating mob violence in West Berlin of such magnitude that combined strength of West Berlin police force and Allied garrisons (at present levels) would be taxed to the extreme to provide security for all installations and neutralize the actions taken by galr [<hi rend="italic">goon?</hi>] squads and mobs in various sectors of city. This assertion is not based on pure theory. We have an integrated Civil Defense Plan which has been war-gamed in a joint command post exercise involving the three Allied garrisons and West Berlin police. This combined exercise clearly indicated that the combined capability of the Allied garrisons in Berlin and West Berlin police force is already marginal for coping with large civil disturbances.</p>
<p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> made several comments on Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>’s statement. He said that it was known that Communists had plans for civil disturbances. He also stated that any reduction of Allied garrisons would, he felt certain, cause deterioration in the morale of West Berlin police since they feel that physical support of strong Allied garrison essential to security of West Berlin. He added that, if size of police force were increased, in event a reduction of Allied garrison occurred, the same feeling would prevail and in his opinion, would nullify the effectiveness of such an increase.</p>
<p>In answer to several general remarks made by others present concerning ways to provide West Berliners with arms for self-protection, <pb xml:id="pg_1055" n="1055" facs="1080"/>General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> stated that a plan was being studied to increase the size of the police force by organizing and training auxiliary police. Further, that this appeared to be only logical way to develop additional forces from local resources. Mayor stated he felt plan should not be implemented during Geneva conference. All present agreed.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> asked Secretary if he felt Soviets really attached great importance to reduction of forces. Secretary replied that this seemed to be subject in which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> intensely interested since he consistently brought it up at meetings. General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> remarked it appeared to him that if Soviets so anxious for reduction they must certainly be considering instigating civil disturbances which made his reasons for not reducing size of Western garrisons even stronger.</p>
<p>Short discussion followed concerning number of effective troops in all three Allied garrisons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> stated that detailed figures furnished by <gloss target="#t_USBER1">USBER</gloss> available in Geneva (<gloss target="#t_USBER1">USBER</gloss>’s 25 to Dept).<note n="2" xml:id="d479fn2">Telegram 25 from Berlin, July 6, transmitted detailed figures on the strength and types of troops in the Berlin garrison. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 762.0221/7–659)</note></p>
<p>Secretary then asked Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> and Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> to give their views on paragraph 1(b) of Western proposals of June 16.</p>
<p>General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> stated that in his opinion this paragraph, if agreed upon by the four powers, would not cause the three Allied garrisons in Berlin any more trouble than they were accustomed to in dealing with the Soviets on access matters; that on access our arguments with Soviets usually involved meaning of word “control” and that arguments of this nature would continue under any agreement stated in broad terms. On other hand, he felt that agreement expressed in such broad terms would leave West Berliners and economy of West Berlin open to all types of harassments such as increased tolls on autobahn, interference with railroad shipments and movements of personnel or even prohibitive charges for canal traffic similar to those experienced last year. In his opinion, he felt that to protect people and economy of West Berlin an agreement on access should be spelled out so that harassment of this nature would be forestalled.</p>
<p>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> agreed with General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> but added he not sure such a detailed agreement should be worked out by Foreign Ministers but could be evolved at lower level. Apparently Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> intended to indicate that the broad agreement should contain a clause to provide for later working out of detailed arrangements.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> commented that he felt very important factor concerning access arrangements (Allied or German) was provision for four power appeal commission of some type. He stated that failing provision <pb xml:id="pg_1056" n="1056" facs="1081"/>for such four power commission we might find ourselves in Berlin with no one to negotiate with on local access problems.</p>
<p>At one point during discussion General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> recalls—though he is not sure of exact wording—that Secretary asked Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> what he felt would be results in event Soviets sign separate peace treaty with East Germans. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> made rather broad statement to effect that in such event Allies would have great deal more difficulty than West Berliners since East Germans already handling German access.</p>
<p>During course of discussion Secretary asked several questions indicating great interest in morale of the Berliners. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> assured him that the rank and file of Berliners were as strong as ever and that the healthy economic situation reflected optimism on part of businessmen and industrialists. General <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName> stated that as an indication of morale of US garrison, including dependents and civilians, not one family had requested to be sent home from Berlin because of situation existing here, nor to his knowledge had any Department of Defense or statement [<hi rend="italic">State</hi>] personnel arriving here as replacements made provision for maintaining their families in United States. He stated further that apprehension which we had reported from here (<gloss target="#t_ourtel1">ourtel</gloss>s 43 and 45 to Geneva)<note n="3" xml:id="d479fn3">Telegram 43 is printed as telegram 111, <ref target="#d470">Document 470</ref>. Telegram 45 is the same as telegram 113, which is summarized in <ref target="#d470fn2">footnote 2, Document 470</ref>.</note> in his opinion had developed in political circles and did not reflect general attitude of rank and file. Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> made no comment.</p>

<p>I had no opportunity to revert to what I discussed with Chris when I was last in Geneva,<note n="1" xml:id="d480fn1"><persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> was in Geneva July 16 and 17.</note> namely, my estimate of a deterioration in the Western position. At that time the Secretary seemed to be in accord with <pb xml:id="pg_1057" n="1057" facs="1082"/>this view and was giving serious thought to breaking off the meetings. In this I think he would have had <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s support, but obviously, as has been made all too apparent in public statements, the British Government is resolved to go on with these proceedings and to try to obtain a summit conference regardless of the lack of progress at Geneva.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, viewing the differences between the U.S. and British viewpoints, has wisely contented himself by saying as little as possible and, when he is forced to be articulate, merely repeating what he has uttered on previous occasions. He is waiting, I think, for the Western crack to widen. It may be that when the House of Commons recesses the end of this week and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has a last talk next Saturday with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, the lines can be definitively drawn between East and West. Meanwhile, I only hope the Western Foreign Ministers will limit their statements and, under no conditions, make any new proposals. Once again, the Soviets have demonstrated the advisability of patience. To my mind, the Western position is being eroded in the process and the sooner there is a conclusion the better.</p>

<p>[Here follows a 10-page discussion on unrelated subjects; for text, see volume X, Part 1, <ref target="#d99">Document 99</ref>.]</p>
<p>The Vice President interjected that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said that he had hopes for success in Geneva.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1058" n="1058" facs="1083"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> confirmed that, saying that otherwise the Soviets would have recalled <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and their delegation. The key problem in Geneva, he went on, was liquidation of the state of war with Germany. The solution of this problem would lead to the solution of other problems—just like a knitted fabric, if one thread is pulled, the whole garment comes apart. Soviet proposals on this subject were formulated in such a way as to make clear that the Soviet Union was seeking no advantage for itself. As far as the legal position was concerned it was quite clear: the West had settled with West Germany without regard to Soviet interests. The Soviet right to reparations had been disregarded, a monetary reform had been introduced, and a trizonal arrangement had been made. The West also had recognized <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s government. Soviet moves in East Germany were similar to those by the West in West Germany and they only followed later. Now the USSR had no claim against West Germany. The West had violated the Potsdam agreement not to rearm Germany; now it permitted Germany’s rearmament, even with atomic weapons. What the Soviet Union wanted to do now was the same that the Western powers had done earlier—it wanted to liquidate the state of war with Germany. It had proposed reasonable solutions to this problem which were being refused by the West, which still insisted that German reunification was a four power responsibility. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> went on by contending that there was no document in which that responsibility was set forth. (The Vice President indicated that he wanted to respond but <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> kept the floor.) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then cited Viet Nam as a parallel example. He said that there were not two correct answers to these questions but only one and the whole world knew that. U.S. policy with regard to Viet Nam was not understood by the world: Ho Chi Minh wants elections while the U.S., contrary to the agreement reached over three years ago, opposes them. What was the reason for that? It was not just the refusal by Diem, since everybody knew that the West pulled the strings on him.</p>
<p>The Vice President interjected here that he was wondering who pulled strings in North Viet Nam—the people?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued by saying that the three powers had signed an agreement regarding Viet Nam’s unification, to which the U.S. had also subscribed, whereas in the case of Germany no such agreement had been signed. In any case historical progress was not determined by legal documents. In the Soviet Union the Soviet system had been established by a decree of their majesty the people—it had been the people who had decided whether Russia should be Socialist or bourgeois. The decision had been for socialism and the Russian people had thrown out of their country foreign troops, including American troops. Similarly, it was the German people who should decide the question of Germany’s reunification, while the great powers must recognize the fact that now <pb xml:id="pg_1059" n="1059" facs="1084"/>there were two Germanies. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, he wanted to refute reports in the Western press alleging that he had said in Poland that he was against a united Germany and was demanding that all of Germany go socialist. To this he could say the following, “You have no intention of making war over West Germany, neither do we; what you want is that all Germany be capitalist. Isn’t it?” Yet all that the great powers can do is express their opinions, but the people themselves do not have to take those opinions into account. The present situation in Germany, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> emphasized, cannot be changed without war.</p>
<p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> noted at this point that what the U.S. wants for the German people is what the German people want for themselves.</p>
<p>To this <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stated that the people in West Germany had pronounced themselves and that this was also true with regard to the people in East Germany. The fact is that a mother cannot control the birth of her child—and a father is even less capable of doing that—so why does not the U.S. let East Germany be socialist if the people there prefer that system?</p>
<p>The Vice President observed that he did not propose to rehash postwar history. The Soviets obviously had their views, we had ours, and we disagreed with what had happened in Viet Nam and East Germany. However, he said, he wanted to make a few points. First, he was glad to hear that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed with the principle of free elections; but if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was for elections in Viet Nam, why was he against elections in Germany?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> claimed he had not said that; he was not against elections but simply wanted the Germans to decide this question themselves.</p>
<p>The Vice President resumed by saying that if the people were to express their views, then such views must be properly recorded. Yet North Viet Nam did not permit the International Control Commission to operate in its territory. Thus the reason for not holding elections in Viet Nam was the impossible conditions created by Communists in the northern part of that country.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interrupted the Vice President and said that he wanted to make an additional point regarding Germany. He said that the Soviet Government was concerned about the question of West Berlin; the prestige of the Great Powers was involved there and the Soviet Union did not want to be misunderstood in the world. As a lawyer, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would understand that the strictly legal solution to this problem would be for the Western Powers to pull out of West Berlin, with West Berlin becoming a part of East Germany. The reason for that was the fact that the Potsdam agreement had provided for Berlin to be the capital of all Germany, with the Control Council meeting there and governing the <pb xml:id="pg_1060" n="1060" facs="1085"/>entire territory of Germany. The three Western Powers had not recognized this council and had formed <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s Government, thus depriving the Control Council of its function. At that point Berlin ceased to be the capital of all Germany. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> emphasized that he was not trying to say who was right and who was wrong in this matter. What he was trying to say was that the logical development would have been for the West to pull out of West Berlin at that time, rather than to stay and create a divided Berlin. Yet the Soviet Union recognizes the fact of West Berlin’s existence, it realizes that the capitalist system prevails there, and it wants to find a way to ensure that the will of West Berlin’s population would not be violated. The best way to achieve that objective would be the creation of a free city of West Berlin. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> noted that the Vice President appeared to be smiling and said that this was a serious question. It was a hard nut that had to be cracked and the Soviet Union took a very serious view of it. To safeguard the prestige of the Western Powers the USSR had proposed the creation of a free city of West Berlin so that neither side would feel it had lost something. Yet the West accuses the Soviet Union of wanting to engulf West Berlin. In reply to such accusations the Soviet Union has proposed that an international force be set up to guarantee the integrity of West Berlin. The USSR would be willing to join such a token force under an agreement registered with the U.N. If the Western Powers did not want Soviet participation, then neutral forces should be stationed in West Berlin. (<persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> interjected that any forces would be acceptable except occupation forces.) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> went on by saying that retention of occupation forces meant maintenance of the state of war. Thus, in West Berlin the Western Powers were taking Molotov’s line with regard to Austria. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> and others had said that the West had 11 to 12 thousand troops in West Berlin. They would be of no military significance in case of war. The question arises why they are stationed there. He said he had told <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d481fn1">See <ref target="#d417">Documents 417</ref> and <ref target="#d420">420</ref>.</note> that if the Soviet Union wanted a war it would want the West to have at least 100,000 troops in West Berlin, because the Soviet Army could liquidate them in one blow. In Stalingrad 90,000 German troops had been liquidated, so what could 11,000 do? <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> emphasized that the Soviet Union would never agree to a perpetuation of the occupation regime in West Berlin and of the state of war with Germany. What they could do, in order not to embarrass either side and avoid injury to their prestige, was to put the brakes on this situation and have an interim arrangement for West Berlin. The West should tell <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> to enter into contact with East Germany and negotiate with it. The West should also tell <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> that the Great Powers have no intention of quarreling over the Germans and that they will accept any agreement worked out between <pb xml:id="pg_1061" n="1061" facs="1086"/>the two Germanys. If the West did the same, the Soviet Union would also pull out its troops. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> went on to say that he could see nothing unacceptable or offensive in this proposal, if the West sought peace. However, it appeared to the Soviet Union that by continuing the state of war with Germany the West was trying to prolong the cold war and perhaps turn it into a hot war. If this proposal were accepted, the center of friction, i.e., West Berlin, would disappear. The situation there was fraught with danger, because he, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, could not give guarantee against some Red soldier pulling a trigger or engaging in some other irresponsible action. The same was applicable to the U.S. with regard to its troops, and as everyone knew, incidents had already occurred. The interests of the Soviet Union and the U.S. do not cross, they rather go parallel, and all the Soviet Union wants is peace. The U.S. could develop its own way, the Soviet Union its way; the United States wants to pray for the captives of socialism, but the Soviet Union does not do that for the captives of capitalism because they do not need it. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then remarked jokingly that if men should fail to agree, then they should appoint their wives to settle their differences.</p>
<p>The Vice President pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s observations had been answered many times and repeated that neither side was likely to convince the other of the correctness of its views. For example, one could argue endlessly as to who was responsible for setting up the West German or East German governments. The U.S. could point out that the West German settlement fully reserved the rights of the USSR. When <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> refers to 11,000 troops in West Berlin, the U.S. can refer to 18 Soviet divisions in East Germany. It was also obvious that the two sides had different approaches to the unification of Germany. The Vice President stated that he had the impression that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> honestly believes that unification would not be practical in the foreseeable future and also that the Western Powers do not want it.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected that he was convinced that this was so, especially in view of the fact that representatives of the Western Powers themselves had made statements to that effect.</p>
<p>The Vice President continued by saying that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, being a keen student of history, would realize why reunification is essential for peace. He should know that when a vital and strong nation is divided in two then seeds are planted for the emergence of a future leader who will seek to accomplish reunification. However, the Vice President remarked, he realized that here there were differences of opinion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Reverting to the question of West Berlin, the Vice President said that as far as the Soviet proposals for a revision of the situation in West Berlin was concerned, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must admit that the present situation had been precipitated as a result of Soviet action rather than ours. This was a fact and not an accusation.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1062" n="1062" facs="1087"/>
<p>However, since there is a crisis in that area the great powers must seek ways and means to find a reasonable settlement. The Vice President said that he believed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself would agree that the West and the USSR have common responsibility and interests with regard to Germany and Berlin. Under such circumstances no one power can say that the situation must be changed in a certain specific way and that all others must agree. The status quo in all respects must remain and any changes must be discussed and agreed. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could not expect President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, for example, to agree to attend a high level conference for the sole purpose of accepting the other side’s proposals as to how the present situation is to be revised. Nor would the U.S. expect <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to do that. Where great powers are concerned each must go to the conference table as an equal, and all of them must be prepared to debate and discuss proposals put forward by any of them. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would not want to attend a conference simply to sign Western proposals on the dotted line. As far as the present situation at the Geneva conference was concerned, it was apparent it could not end without progress at least as to the procedure for future give and take negotiations of these problems. Whatever the two sides may think of mistakes either of them may have made with regard to Germany, the American people and the American Government could not accept what in effect is a unilateral action in an area where vital interests of the U.S. are affected. Yet this did not mean, the Vice President continued, that no new arrangements could be made regarding West Berlin and Germany. It only meant that self- and mutually respecting nations cannot be committed in advance by the other side as to what they have to accept. Where big powers are concerned the climate must not be one of crisis and tension. The Vice President then invited Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> to speak in light of his own experience at the Geneva conference.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> pointed out that complicated technical questions were involved, which he was not going to discuss in detail, but stressed that the Vice President had underscored the fact that this was a dangerous situation not of our making. The West had first submitted proposals for the settlement of the entire German problem, but after it had recognized that an overall settlement was not possible, it had now taken up a more limited area and made a number of concessions to meet the Soviet point of view on Berlin. Then the West had suggested that the present negotiations be prolonged so that the present situation would be discussed in order not to allow it to come to a crisis and bring dangerous consequences.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected that this was a proposal by <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>, who had even suggested a ten-year period. The Vice President observed that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself had earlier referred to postponement.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1063" n="1063" facs="1088"/>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> emphasized that this proposal had been introduced by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and then went on to say that if this could not be done, a really difficult situation would develop. He said that it was necessary first to take measures to prevent the development of a crisis and then in the interim perhaps to make progress on such questions as atomic tests and disarmament. If progress could be made in these areas, other problems might be easier to solve.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed that the President could not be confronted with a situation of going to a conference only to sign proposals by the other side. However, he should go to a heads of state conference when there is a basis for agreement, but negotiations are needed to develop terms that would be mutually acceptable. He also said that the same was true as far as he was concerned: there would be no sense in his going to a summit meeting only to sign an agreement perpetuating the occupation regime in West Berlin. He would much rather go hunting and shoot ducks.</p>
<p>The Vice President reiterated that it was the Soviet Union which had created the present situation in Berlin. The Soviet Union wanted a change in the status quo. As Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> had pointed out, the respective proposals of the two sides could not be discussed here today. However, it was implicit that if a high level meeting were held its purpose must be to develop new approaches to this question. The position of the U.S. was not that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should go to a summit meeting only to perpetuate the status quo.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> protested that he could not understand the meaning of “status quo.” He said he was wondering whether the Vice President meant by status quo perpetuation of the state of war. Such status quo could not serve the cause of peace. The Soviet Union favored the status quo but it was also for the liquidation of the vestiges of war. The Soviet proposals did not undermine the situation which had developed after the war: they would retain the present borders and preserve the existing social system.</p>
<p>The Vice President observed that in his remarks he had been referring only to Berlin. To this <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that the status quo in Berlin could be retained only by retaining the state of war.</p>
<p>The Vice President said that he wanted to repeat and emphasize that the U.S. could not accept an ultimatum situation where one side would predetermine in advance what the other side was to accept. The Soviet Union proposed that if no agreement was reached in 18 or 24 months the Soviet Union would take a unilateral action. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would certainly not like being confronted with a similar situation. The problem involved must be discussed.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1064" n="1064" facs="1089"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> retorted that this was why the Soviet Union had suggested that a peace treaty be concluded with Germany and that it be discussed by all countries concerned.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> then summarized the basic differences as follows: the Soviet Union says it cannot agree to an indefinite prolongation of the occupation regime in Berlin; the West, on the other hand, says that it cannot agree to a perpetuation of the division of Germany, as would result from all Soviet proposals put forward—all of them provide for an East German government.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then suggested that the talk be frank. He said that the purpose of so-called free elections as proposed by the West was to engulf East Germany and make all of Germany an ally of the West. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> does not want the West German political system and does not want to become a member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Does the West want the Soviet Union to overthrow the present regime in East Germany and have there a regime which would be identical to that in West Germany? The Soviet Union could present the same sort of demand with regard to West Germany, but this would be absurd and the Germans in West Germany would not agree to that. The inexorable fact was, he continued, that there were two Germanys in existence. If the West is against recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, efforts should be exerted to find a formula whereby the West would not have to sign a peace treaty with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Yet such a formula should make it possible for the Soviet Union to sign a peace treaty with East Germany and have a state of peace there. As far as West Berlin was concerned agreement could be reached that the social order in that city should be determined by the will of its population and access to that city could also be guaranteed. The Soviet Union recognizes that in the present heated atmosphere any document of this type could be detrimental morally to one of the sides. Consequently, agreement should be reached on the time when such a document could be signed and the source of trouble done away with. As to the provisional arrangements for West Berlin, the Western proposals contained some sound elements; the situation should be discussed on that basis and on the basis of Soviet proposals combined. Yet one should keep in mind that these would be only provisional arrangements.</p>
<p>The Vice President asked whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not see the position that a time limit would put President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in, to which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> retorted that the West also had put a time period of 2-1/2 years.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> clarified that the Western proposals provided for separate elections in East Germany. Nevertheless, the West had recognized that this was now impossible. The West was not satisfied with the present situation in Berlin and since it could not find a solution satisfactory to the Soviet Union it tried to find a situation which <pb xml:id="pg_1065" n="1065" facs="1090"/>would ensure peace and avoid the development of a crisis. It was important now to start moving step by step toward agreement. Yet if the Soviets forced a crisis, it would be difficult to understand how they could reconcile this with their words about peace. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> suggested that this problem be put off and that the parties concerned try to solve other problems in the meantime.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, raising his voice, retorted that the Ambassador should be careful when using the word peace. What he had said sounded like a threat. The Soviet Union would sign a peace treaty and the West could declare war, if it wished. When peace was at stake the Soviet Union was very sensitive, and if the West chose to fight against a peace treaty everyone would recognize who was to blame. If the Soviet Union did not want negotiation, it would have signed a peace treaty with East Germany—this was its right and also the right of the states bordering on Germany. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> asserted that he was not stupid and that he could understand the real meaning of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>’s words.</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> replied that what he wanted to say was that forcing a crisis would not be a step toward peace. No threat was implied, and it was the Soviets who were threatening to force a crisis.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said he wanted to know what was incompatible with Western interests in the Soviet proposals, if the West wanted peace. What steps did the West propose to take? If it wanted to ensure the present social system in West Berlin and if that system was favored by the population, this could be negotiated and there was no disagreement on that point. But the Soviet Union could never agree to a perpetuation of the West’s occupation rights. Whatever time period is involved it logically follows that a peace treaty, whether concluded by both sides or separately, will end the occupation rights of the Western powers. This, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said, was not an ultimatum but only the logic of the situation.</p>
<p>The Vice President pointed out that it should be recognized that vital interests of both sides were involved and that neither side should confront the other with an impossible situation.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> interjected at this point, “We propose only peace—you yourself used the slogan today—what’s wrong with that?”</p>
<p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> thought that such offers as troop limitation and non-stationing of atomic armaments were not peaceful.</p>
<p>The Vice President noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> had mentioned two points that would change the present situation. Other suggestions had been advanced, too, but it was important that changes must be made by agreement. He said that he wanted to reiterate that <pb xml:id="pg_1066" n="1066" facs="1091"/>there should be no predetermined conclusions as to what the other side must accept. The Berlin situation may appear important but in the long run discussion by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and the President of such broader matters as disarmament, nuclear tests, trade, etc., might be more important. Progress could be made in these areas, but only in a climate of calm, not of crisis. The Vice President said that it was most important to create as favorable a climate as possible for discussion and progress in these broader areas.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> agreed that a calm atmosphere was needed, but suggested that the U.S. should not threaten the Soviet Union with war. Apparently the Vice President did not want to use this sort of language, so he had asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> to do so.</p>
<p>The Vice President replied that he had heard the Ambassador’s statement. The Ambassador had said nothing more than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself had said, namely, that if he were confronted with an impossible situation he would have the means to do what was necessary about it.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> tried to refute this statement by saying that he had never said that he would use military power. The Great Powers should accept what the Germans want. (<persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> interjected “confederation.”) However, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> continued, he still wanted the Vice President to answer his question whether the U.S. sought to preserve its occupation rights or whether it was trying to preserve access to West Berlin and the social order prevailing there. If the U.S. wanted to preserve the occupation status, this might cause war, because, with U.S. troops stationed there, incidents might occur, U.S. aircraft might collide with Soviet aircraft in air corridors, etc. In fact, U.S. planes have violated Soviet air space, and all this could provoke war. If, however, the U.S. wanted to preserve the existing social order in West Berlin as well as full access to that city, agreement on that could be reached. If the U.S. wants peace there is no reason for it to retain its rights of occupation. Referring then to the question of disarmament and nuclear tests, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that the Soviet Union, on May 10, 1955, had presented as its own disarmament proposals<note n="2" xml:id="d481fn2">For text of this proposal, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin;</hi> May 30, 1955, pp. 900–905.</note> previously introduced by the West, but the West had renounced them. The Soviet Union was willing to discuss disarmament but not on the basis referred by the West where only one representative of the Soviet side would participate and all other participants would be members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Parity was necessary for such discussions.</p>
<p>[Here follows discussion of other subjects.]</p>
<p>The Vice President then said that the discussions appeared to boil down to the following: there were broad possibilities for discussion of <pb xml:id="pg_1067" n="1067" facs="1092"/>these and other problems, between <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and the President or at a Heads of Government meeting, provided there was no atmosphere of crisis. In this connection the Vice President recalled <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s statement that the Congressional Resolution on captive nations<note n="3" xml:id="d481fn3">For text of this resolution, approved on July 17, see 73 Stat. 212.</note> had created an unfavorable atmosphere for the Vice President’s visit. On the other hand, in the U.S. the Geneva conference had more significance to our people and leaders than one would normally expect. The President, of course, had authority as far as conferences and topics for discussion were concerned, but he, just as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, must be responsive to public opinion. Because of its symbolic significance to the people of the U.S., it was important that the Geneva conference must not be allowed to fail. Some progress in Geneva would have a very favorable impact on our people and would create a much more favorable atmosphere for discussion of other problems than if the conference ended in failure.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> pointed out that he had just spent ten days in Poland, where the problems under discussion at Geneva were of vital importance. However, he had not once during his visit mentioned Geneva publicly so as not to make <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s work more difficult.</p>
<p>The Vice President observed that in the final analysis any results, positive or negative, at Geneva would be ascribed by public opinion not to the Foreign Ministers but rather to the Heads of Government. Under these circumstances, the Vice President continued, he believed that there were possibilities for reasonable solution. This was why he was happy to hear <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> say that he was hopeful that Geneva could reach the success awaited by the whole world. This, however, did not mean that the U.S. demanded that the conference should solve all problems, and he personally was not authorized to present any specific proposal, but it was necessary that the climate be improved as a result of the conference.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied that the latest Soviet proposals were flexible. They provided for new negotiations after 18 months if the two Germanys failed to reach agreement between themselves. This does away with any reference to what the West calls an ultimatum. It also gives an opportunity for governments to explain to their peoples the reasons for a summit meeting. He said it was necessary to realize that to go any further would mean perpetuation of the occupation regime. In that case there would not be any need for a conference because that state of affairs was already in existence. He then said that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> had reported to him that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> during his visit in the U.S.<note n="4" xml:id="d481fn4">See <ref target="#d137">Document 137</ref>.</note> that the U.S. must also reckon with the German danger, since Germany <pb xml:id="pg_1068" n="1068" facs="1093"/>had broken the peace four times within the past hundred years. This appeared to be the position of the U.S. Of course, the French would prefer to see Germany divided into even more parts, perhaps three, while England would like to see Germany broken up into four or even more parts. Therefore the question arises why the U.S. follows <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>’s line.</p>
<p>The Vice President replied that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> must realize that if the President of the U.S. and the Prime Minister of the USSR agreed that any nation must not threaten peace in Europe, then it could not. After all, the U.S. and USSR had fought together quite recently for the same cause and both of them were even more powerful now. Or was it that the Soviets were afraid of Germany?</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> replied in the negative but said that the situation now was different than that before the war. He said he did not want to brag or be disrespectful toward his high guests, but the fact was that during the period of Hitler’s aggressions in Europe the Soviet Union had been the only socialist state and had been in isolation. The French and the British had been against the USSR and had had U.S. sympathy. Now, of course, Japan is defeated and in this connection, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> noted, it should be said that the U.S. contribution in the war against Japan had been the greater, although the Soviet contribution had not been very small either; after all, it had been the Soviet Army who had liquidated the Japanese forces in Manchuria. Italy was also a defeated country, while China had been united and covered the USSR’s eastern flank. Half of Korea was socialist. In Europe the socialist bloc was united with the exception of Yugoslavia, which is neutral, but which, he believed, would fight on the Soviet side if the Soviet Union were attacked. Thus today there remained in Europe only England, France and Spain, while the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and Belgium, do not count militarily. Oh yes, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> added laughingly, he forgot that Luxembourg could constitute a threat to the Soviet Union. In this situation could Germany threaten the Soviet Union? Yes, by provoking a war and drawing other countries into it. The Soviet Union has no doubt that it would destroy Germany, France, England and other countries the very first day of the war. The Soviet Union would, of course, suffer losses too. But the other countries would become deserts. This would be a calamity and we should not allow it to happen. We should not allow <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> to threaten all of us with conflict but rather we should try to build a better life for our children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>The Vice President said he wanted to ask one question, namely, whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> thought there was any room for negotiation in the Soviet position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should imagine that the President was sitting across the table and, without going into any specifics, should say whether there was room for negotiation. The Vice President said <pb xml:id="pg_1069" n="1069" facs="1094"/>that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> himself would not want to come to a meeting if the President were not prepared to negotiate.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that this was a fair question and that it would be easier for him to give a reply to it in terms of what the Soviet Union could not accept. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> could then form his own judgment as to the Soviet willingness to negotiate. The Soviet Union could never accept a perpetuation of the occupation regime in West Berlin, regardless of whether there were a summit meeting or not. As to the solution of the entire Berlin problem, the Soviet position was flexible and fluid except on this one point of occupation status. There would be no point in meeting at the summit if the participants were to perpetuate a situation that already exists. The West could present to the Soviet Union any proposals to ensure the present social order in West Berlin and access to that city. As far as a peace treaty with Germany is concerned it could ensure the status quo of the two Germanys until time becomes ripe for the liquidation of military blocs. The treaty could contain the most liberal provisions and provide even for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from East Germany and Poland, perhaps a gradual one.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 177. For Acting Secretary. After dinner last evening <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> and Secretary with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJH1">Whitney</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> present began their talk which lasted until after twelve-thirty. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he had with him long draft message from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to President.<note n="1" xml:id="d482fn1">No draft of this message has been found; for the text as sent, see <ref target="#d484">Document 484</ref>.</note> He said it was result of many hours collaboration between Prime Minister and himself and that Prime Minister was prepared to dispatch it immediately himself or have it go forward to Washington as a message concurred in by Secretary or alternatively commented on concurrently by <pb xml:id="pg_1070" n="1070" facs="1095"/>Secretary. Burden of draft was that matter of our rights in Berlin seemed to have been satisfactorily met by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and outline of an agreement was now clearly in sight. Under these circumstances Prime Minister thought that Foreign Ministers should wind up their work in two or three days by preparing paper setting forth points of agreement and disagreement for transmission to a Summit Conference to be called by President for August 20 or in any event not later than September 1. Prime Minister in his draft went on to make perfectly clear that from his point of view it would be a terrible mistake to have the exchange of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visits unless firmly related to and dependent on a prior Summit meeting. He said that under former circumstances suspicions would be aroused among certain of our allies and his own position made extremely difficult.<note n="2" xml:id="d482fn2">In <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 175, July 27, <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> characterized <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s presentation as follows: “It was obvious from <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>’s rather nervous manner and quite long-winded exposition of the British position that he must have found <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> very much agitated and terribly anxious to impress us with the necessity of quick action leading to a Summit.” (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1329)</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> supplemented his exposition of the draft with long explanatory commentary. When he finished Secretary first made point that he could not fail to resent implication that our allies could not trust us in a bilateral discussion with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and that this came with ill grace from the British in light of their trip to Moscow last winter. This produced long discourse by <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> in which he disclaimed any lack of faith but emphasized that by the visits <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would attain everything he had been seeking without paying a price and that since negotiations would be impossible to avoid in such visits it would constitute new relationship on bilateral basis with our allies excluded from participation.</p>
<p>Pros and cons were discussed at great length. During course of conversation Secretary emphasized that whereas he was as anxious as President to find the grounds to justify convoking Summit Conference he could not in honesty as of now detect really any progress whatsoever. There had been clarification of positions and sharpening of issues but Soviets had made no concessions other than extending their original time period.</p>
<p>As to form of transmission Secretary said that he preferred <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to dispatch that message on his own responsibility that same evening without any indication of concurrence or comment by Secretary himself. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> was obviously impressed by Secretary’s arguments. He emphasized time and time again that domestic politics constituted only minimal element in British view and in general re-emphasized wellknown British arguments for Summit which would be on Western rather than Soviet initiative. At one point late in conversation the Secretary <pb xml:id="pg_1071" n="1071" facs="1096"/>said that he was expressing thought which had just that moment occurred to him which was possibility of Canadians calling Summit meeting at Quebec City in light of inability of Geneva Conference to resolve Berlin issue. This obviously had great appeal to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> and Secretary reiterated that it was an idea and in no sense a suggestion or considered thought.</p>
<p>Toward end of talk <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> asked Secretary to read draft message which <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> planned to send to President. Secretary demurred for some time since he had expressed his views in general terms and did not want to be in position of making comments on the details of what <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> wished to say. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> insisted Secretary read over draft and to his surprise found that at very outset it predicated any recommendations to President on Summit on receiving from the Soviets the very concession which we had felt most important, namely, the acceptance of our wording regarding any temporary arrangements for Berlin contained in our June 16 offer. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said he was planning to talk to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> on telephone and that he would give us the following day copy of what <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> finally decided to send.</p>
<p>At conclusion of talk it was agreed that at lunch Monday <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> would push <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> hard on the rights question in an effort to ascertain whether the formulation of this point in our document of June 16 was acceptable in its present form.</p>

<p>Subject: Private Session.</p>
<p>At <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s working tea today two-hour discussion with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was for the most part repetition of the sterile performance to which we <pb xml:id="pg_1072" n="1072" facs="1097"/>have become accustomed in our private talks since reconvening July 13. Virtually only progress, if it can be called that, was <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s agreement to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s suggestion that each side spend tomorrow drafting its version of terms of a Berlin settlement for discussion possibly Wednesday morning. Also <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> may have intended slightly to relax his insistence on link between Berlin settlement and all-German negotiations although he continued, despite sharp probing, particularly by Secretary, to refuse to take clear stand on this issue. On other hand his adamance on need for Western agreement to reduce present troop strength in West Berlin remains as firm as ever, and this now appears to be Soviet sine qua non of agreement on other aspects of Berlin settlement.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> began meeting by reporting on his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> who was his guest at lunch today. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had following reservations on “draft communiqué”<note n="1" xml:id="d483fn1">See <ref target="#d453">Document 453</ref>.</note> which <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had discussed with him in general terms:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) In preamble, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> opposed any mention of “agreements in force,” asserting that reference should be to existing situation only;</item>
<item>(2) <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> opposed stipulating reunification as terminal point of arrangements; he insisted reference to duration of interim settlement should be confined to provision that Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, as presently constituted, snould reconvene after “x months” to discuss Berlin question.</item>
</list>
<p>After <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s report, there was extended discussion of other aspects of possible Berlin settlement of which following were highlights:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) Re troop levels, Secretary again stressed extent of concession by West in limiting strength to present levels and made clear to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that this was final Western offer. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, however, insisted this represented no change in “existing situation” and was therefore totally unacceptable to <gloss target="#t_SOV1">Sov</gloss>s. When pressed for explanation why Soviets attach so much importance to this question, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Western agreement to reduce troop strength would be substantial proof of West willingness to cooperate with Soviets in reducing tensions and, furthermore, would dispel Soviet suspicions that West insistence on present troop levels connected in some way with secret plans for their use for certain sinister purposes, which, however, unknown to Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>, on his own behalf, suggested this question could be left to heads of government, but <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied if Foreign Ministers couldn’t reach understanding, he doubted if heads of government would be able to resolve question, (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>)</item>
<item>(2) Re ban on propaganda and subversive activities, all West <gloss target="#t_ForMin1">ForMin</gloss>s made clear there must be absolute reciprocity. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, more forthcoming than previously, said he would not exclude possibility of agreeing on formula which would provide for restraining <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interference in internal affairs of West Berlin and, in any case, thought that</item>
<pb xml:id="pg_1073" n="1073" facs="1098"/>
<item>mutually acceptable formula could be worked out, but it must not place responsibility equally on both parts of Berlin.</item>
<item>(3) Re Soviet June 19 proposal for four-power supervisory commission, both Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> underlined inconsistency in Soviet position which obligated West to accept Soviet commitment without inspection on access procedures but prescribed inspection of West commitments with regard to troop levels and armaments. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had previously made clear commission’s responsibilities would be confined to troop levels, armaments, and activities but would not extend to access problem.</item>
</list>
<p>At <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s suggestion, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, although first proposing a plenary session tomorrow, agreed to devote the day to preparation of papers on Berlin settlement to be discussed possibly Wednesday. Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> will lunch with Secretary tomorrow to discuss Western paper, announcing subject is disarmament to explain <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName>’s absence, and all three will meet with <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Brentano</persName> at 3 p.m. If Western paper cleared in time and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> ready, Secretary may meet with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> late tomorrow afternoon to exchange papers and give Secretary opportunity further to probe <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on rigidity of his position re agreement on troop levels and all-German negotiations as sine qua non Berlin settlement.</p>

<p>Dear Friend, I fully understand and share your anxiety about the maintenance of our rights in Berlin unimpaired by any interim agreement. In our agreeing to a moratorium it must be clearly understood that at the end of the period fixed our rights have not been affected and we return to a position of negotiation with our rights as they are now. Nor of course must either side take any unilateral action during the moratorium. In a word, my concept of the moratorium is like a period <pb xml:id="pg_1074" n="1074" facs="1099"/>that sometimes elapses between the acts of a play—“X” years pass, and when the curtain rises again the negotiation is resumed with us all, including the Russians, in the same position as we are today.</p>
<p>As I understand the latest exchanges in Geneva, that is the position which <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is now accepting. If the formula of the Western proposal of June 16 is taken as a basis, that should be good enough for us. This I think could be called progress certainly when we compare it first with the ultimatum of November 27, 1958, and secondly with the Soviet proposals of the 10th and 19th June. In fact the discussions at Geneva have been useful and have served to narrow the differences and to provide the outline of at least an agreement for a moratorium over Berlin.</p>
<p>Now for the length of the moratorium. What I suppose we want is a period of at least two and a half years which would take us over the next German elections. It is a matter of judgment whether we are likely to get such a period at the Foreign Ministers Meeting or whether it would be better to leave it for the Heads of Government. The question is at which meeting the better bargain can be made. On the question of nuclear armaments in Berlin and the rights of military and civilian access during the moratorium, the Foreign Secretaries are already within a measurable distance of agreement. The level of our forces in Berlin is a very important point with regard to which we must remember the morale of the West Berliners. I feel this is a matter which can only be finally resolved at a meeting of the Heads of Government.</p>
<p>That leaves the question of how to discuss the whole German problem during the moratorium. The Russians’ first position was to insist on an All-German Committee. Ours was a Four Power Commission. I believe that this is also a matter which could be left for discussion at the Meeting of Heads of Government, with a probability of some satisfactory intermediate formula being found.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretaries have worked now for something like eight weeks, and I fear that if they go on talking much more things may begin to go backward rather than forward. So I hope you will feel that we should now proceed to tell the Foreign Ministers to prepare for a Summit on the basis of the progress already made. That being so, I have been extremely interested in what Chris told <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> of your approach to Koslov and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s reply. You certainly gained a great deal out of this because although he is making these rather hostile noises publicly he is obviously anxious to visit the United States and to talk with you. The question which Chris has discussed with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> is what should be the next step. Having regard to your plans and my preoccupations, the opening date for a Summit must either be during the last days of August or, at the latest, September 1, or postponed until some time to suit you at the end of October, or the beginning of November.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1075" n="1075" facs="1100"/>
<p>There are two difficulties about the later date. First it involves the Russians being willing to wait as long as that and secondly if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s visit to the United States takes place, it would be difficult to avoid discussions of substance on the matters outstanding. You would probably find this embarrassing. It might cause considerable suspicion on the part of the French and Germans, nor would my public position be very easy to explain. I therefore would much prefer the earlier date.</p>
<p>This involves our bringing the Foreign Ministers Meeting to a very rapid conclusion. That still leaves the question of procedure.</p>
<p>As I understand it, you now owe <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> an answer to his message about your invitation. I would suggest that in view of all these considerations you should in your reply couple the idea of his visit to the United States with a proposal for a formal Summit Meeting in Washington or Quebec, towards the end of August. To give a choice of place might be easier for <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. At the same time as you issue this invitation you might issue similar invitations to a Summit to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and myself, and inform <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> of what you were doing. I assume that there would be no fixed agenda for the Summit but after dealing with these German questions, we could perhaps pass on to other questions, for instance, in what forum a substantive discussion on disarmament might best take place.</p>
<p>At the same time as asking <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> and me to come to a Summit, you might suggest a Western Summit including <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> to meet in Paris a week or ten days before.</p>
<p>If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and I were to accept this plan, I do not see how <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> could stand out in view of your most generous suggestion of coming to Paris beforehand.</p>
<p>With warm regard,</p>
<p>As ever,</p>

<p>The President had before him a series of message and dispatches, including a report from the Vice President,<note n="1" xml:id="d485fn1">Presumably the report from the Vice President on his conversation with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> (see <ref target="#d481">Document 481</ref>) that was transmitted in telegram 320 from Moscow, July 26.</note> a long letter from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d485fn2"><ref target="#d484">Document 484</ref>.</note> and several messages from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> reflecting the situation in Geneva.<note n="3" xml:id="d485fn3">Although the messages from <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> cannot be identified with certainty, one of them was <gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 177 (<ref target="#d482">Document 482</ref>).</note> He spoke particularly of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s letter, proposing that the President call a summit meeting at the end of August or the first of September. The President said he saw no reason why he should propose a summit meeting. Long ago he and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had agreed that the Foreign Ministers should work out those plans. He said he has the feeling the British are trying to manipulate his activities with respect to an exchange of visits with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and a summit meeting, much too closely. He thought perhaps we should be more reserved in our discussions with the British—even so, we would not be “clamming up” as they did before Suez. He said it came with very ill grace from <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to express reservations about his seeing <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> before a summit meeting when we recall the circumstances of <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s trip to Moscow.</p>
<p>In response to a question by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, the President agreed that he could advise Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> that he could mention the discussions concerning an exchange of visits with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName>—telling him only that the President has had an exploratory exchange with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, but not going into full detail. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought that if we tell the French, we will be a long step toward telling the Germans, and then the whole thing will leak to the public. The President noted that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s letter seems to be drafted on the premise that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will accept the Western offer of June sixteenth. Of course, if he does that, and the Ministers agree on proposals as to how to advance reunification, then there would be the basis for a summit meeting.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1077" n="1077" facs="1102"/>
<p>He recalled that he had asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> as well what harm would be done to us if the Soviets were to make a peace treaty with East Germany. He did not see that this would harm important U.S. interests.</p>
<p>The President commented that we seem to be getting close to the point of being forced to have a summit meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> recalled that the idea of the State Department people originally was that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> should visit for a few days just ahead of a summit meeting in Quebec. He saw as a possible line of action announcing before holding the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that a summit meeting would be held some time later this year.</p>
<p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>, taking the June sixteenth statement as a starting point, to work up a plan providing that until the start of 1962 there would be no change in Berlin except as unanimously agreed, and trying to spell out an agreement on how to go ahead on the question of German reunification—perhaps having the Foreign Ministers meet every six months with German advisers present, having other countries as well join the meeting once a year—such countries as Italy, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Perhaps a package of this kind could be accepted by the Soviets.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said it really looks as though to meet <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s proposal, the only way <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could make his visit prior to the summit meeting would be for him to come about August 15th, having the summit meeting on August 25th. The President said that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> has apparently fixed a date in the last week of October for the election, and is now caught by these dates. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> recalled also the Vice President’s report that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said he wants to have a vacation in August. The President added that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had stressed he does not wish to come in hot weather.</p>
<p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he has the impression that something is about to come out from the Russians at Geneva, and, if so, this might be a better light on the whole situation. The President said one other possibility would be to have <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> stay for a few days after a summit meeting that might begin on August 25th. We would be very much in difficulty, however, if the summit meeting did not develop satisfactorily.</p>
<p>The President suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> tell Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s note seems to put us in a difficult spot. On the one hand we do not have any assurance of the progress necessary to justify a summit meeting. On the other, he makes the summit meeting prerequisite and preliminary to bilateral talks with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>. The President <pb xml:id="pg_1078" n="1078" facs="1103"/>commented that he certainly does not want to do anything that would prejudice <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s position in his election.<note n="4" xml:id="d485fn4">At 9 p.m. on July 27, <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> transmitted to <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> a summary of this discussion with the President. Although recognizing that the United States would like some agreement for continued talks on the overall German problem, the Acting Secretary noted “that in view of the extreme pressure from the British it probably would be necessary to agree to a summit if the Soviets accept our view on rights for Berlin.” (<gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 194 to Geneva; Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1333)</note></p>
<p>The President concluded by asking Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> what he would have to do with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in terms of state functions, should the latter come. Specifically, would he have to give a dinner for him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that technically that might not be necessary, since <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is not a Chief of State, but practically he did not see how it could be avoided. The President also commented that in effect <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is the Chief of State of Russia.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Cahto1">Cahto</gloss> 179. For <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> from the Secretary. Have just finished second private session today<note n="1" xml:id="d486fn1">The sessions took place at noon and 3 p.m.</note> with <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> to try to formulate our joint ideas as to where we go from here both from a substantive and a procedural point of view. Both of them are glad that I have been committed to going to Santiago<note n="2" xml:id="d486fn2">The opening session of <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> was scheduled for August 12 at Santiago, Chile.</note> since they feel that this will force a break not necessarily in continued negotiations but certainly in the type of negotiations which have been so fruitless in the past two weeks.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1079" n="1079" facs="1104"/>
<p>As I told you by phone,<note n="3" xml:id="d486fn3">No record of this conversation has been found.</note> I found it was essential to advise <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve de Murville</persName> of the fact that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might be coming to the U.S. I am very glad that I did so since it made it possible for the three of us to discuss possible procedures and timetables with this visit and the possible return visit by the President being a very important part of the whole picture. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>, who as you know has tried to interpret every exchange of views with the Russians from the most optimistic angle, is now pretty well convinced that it will be impossible for us to find sufficient justification in the progress made here to justify a summit conference which would come within the time limits which the British have had to set themselves in relation to elections. While my natural instinct is to look on the optimistic side and my political inclination would have been to lean over backwards in order to make a summit possible, I just could not in good conscience have recommended an early decision on a summit with the situation as it now stands.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I am scheduled to lunch with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and to try to carry the ball for the Western Foreign Ministers since we are endeavoring the bilateral approach to see if it can move things along any better than the multilateral. I shall tomorrow try to do two things: first, ascertain whether there is any further give in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> than there was before as a result of the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> invitation; second, what procedural steps we can now take to carry on our negotiations either with deputies or through a recess to some time such as the time of the Foreign Ministers attendance at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. I think <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is going to insist that we keep right on talking and, if so, it will obviously have to be done at the deputy level.</p>
<p>One very interesting thing developed with regard to the attitudes of both <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> on the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit. Both for different reasons felt it was desirable that the coming visit be publicized at the earliest possible date. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> felt that attention on the visit would take away from attention on a possible summit and might well give the British the talking point in that such a visit would ensure continuity of discussions. Both, however, felt early announcement with regard to the visit particularly if it came before a possible recess or break up next week would be very important in that it would not then be interpreted as having been arranged as a result of the breakdown of the Geneva Conference and as a result of the President’s feeling that he could perhaps alone negotiate where the three powers had failed. I think the foregoing consideration is of real importance. Already the story has leaked out of Washington with regard to a possible Western summit meeting and we are frankly living in dread of a leak on the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit <pb xml:id="pg_1080" n="1080" facs="1105"/>which would not be given the slant which would come from our making the first surprise announcement ourselves.</p>
<p>As I see possible timetable ahead, it would be this. End of August or early September meeting Paris Western heads of state around September 10, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit to US. Around September 20 (if British election dates allow) Foreign Ministers continue discussions New York. October 20, President returns <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit with ensuing travel. November 5, Foreign Ministers again meet either to continue Berlin talks or if progress made arrange for summit meeting. End of November or early December, a summit meeting. In laying out above, I realize many considerations may intervene but it is important at least to have some type of schedule in mind to work toward.</p>

<pb xml:id="pg_1081" n="1081" facs="1106"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> read our proposal rapidly and commented he saw little or any change. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> replied careful study would reveal certain changes and pointed to acceptance Soviet language on atomic weapons and missiles which <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> shrugged off. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> then pointed to final paragraph and <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> smiled at reference to 5 years. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> statement time period not matter of importance or principle.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> then said he was disturbed to note troop figure in our paper remained at 11,000. He said that we must now appreciate vital importance Soviets attached to agreement on a substantial reduction from 11,000 and asked earnestly what we had in mind in this respect. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> replied that 11,000 represented our firm position and as the Secretary had said yesterday<note n="3" xml:id="d487fn3">See <ref target="#d483">Document 483</ref>.</note> willingness on our part to set this ceiling was in our view a very important concession to the professed Soviet concern over the size of the Western garrison in Berlin. He said that moreover growing Soviet concentration on an effort to achieve a reduction gave us increasing cause for suspicion as to what they had in mind. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> dropped subject after repeating that Soviets attached the highest importance to this point.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> inquired if Soviet inclusion of reiteration all-German committee proposal in working paper presumably on Berlin should be construed as interdependent link of these two subjects. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> evaded by saying inclusion intended to give complete Soviet position and that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had repeatedly made clear his position on this point. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> was reminded that on July 20 Western representatives had put forward their views on most appropriate method for continuing discussion of German problem as a whole.</p>
<p>In response to query <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> said Soviets had no present intention publishing their proposal and was told this reflected our intentions likewise with respect to Western paper.</p>
<p>Invitation was extended on behalf of the Secretary to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> plus two advisers for private bilateral luncheon tomorrow with expressed hope long talk could follow. <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName> promised prompt reply to invitation and made no reference to plenary or any other meeting for Wednesday.</p>

<p>“July 28, 1959</p>
<p>“Berlin</p>
<p>“The Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have examined the question of Berlin in the desire to find mutually satisfactory solutions to the problems which have been raised and which derive essentially from the division of Berlin and of Germany. They agreed that the best solution for these problems would be the reunification of Germany. They recognize, however, that meanwhile the existing situation and the agreements at present in force can be modified in certain respects and have consequently agreed upon the following:</p>
<p>“(A) The Soviet Foreign Minister has made known the decision of the Soviet Government no longer to maintain forces in Berlin.</p>
<p>“The Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom and the United States declare that it is the intention of their governments to limit the combined total of their forces in Berlin to the present figure (approximately 11,000). The three Ministers further declare that their governments will from time to time discuss the possibility of reducing such forces if developments permit.</p>
<p>“(B) The Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom and the United States further declare that it is the intention of their governments to continue not to locate atomic weapons or missile installations in West Berlin.</p>
<p>“(C) Free and unrestricted access to West Berlin by land, by water, and by air for all persons, goods and communications, including those of the forces of the Western powers stationed in Berlin, will be maintained in accordance with the procedures in effect in April 1959. Freedom of movement will continue to be maintained between East and West Berlin. All disputes which might arise with respect to access will be raised and settled between the four governments. The latter will establish a quadripartite commission which will meet in Berlin to examine <pb xml:id="pg_1083" n="1083" facs="1108"/>in the first instance any difficulties arising in connection with access and will seek to settle such difficulties. The commission may make arrangements, if necessary, to consult German experts.</p>
<p>“(D) Measures will be taken, consistent with fundamental rights and liberties, to avoid activities in it with respect to Berlin which might either disturb public order or seriously affect the rights and interests, or amount to interference in the internal affairs of others. The Secretary General of the United Nations will be requested to provide a representative, supported by adequate staff, to be established in Berlin, with free access to all parts of the city for the purpose of reporting to the Secretary General any propaganda activities which appear to be in conflict with the foregoing principles. The four governments will consult with the Secretary General in order to determine the appropriate action to be taken in respect to any such report.</p>
<p>“(E) The arrangements specified in sub-paragraphs (A) through (D) above can in the absence of reunification be reviewed at any time after five years by the Foreign Ministers conference as now constituted, if such review is requested by any of the four governments.”</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Begin text.</hi></p>
<p>The Conference of the Foreign Ministers in Geneva has considered the Berlin question in the desire to find a mutually satisfactory solution. The participants in the conference have agreed to implement, with the aim to change the existing situation in West Berlin, measures which will <pb xml:id="pg_1084" n="1084" facs="1109"/>be of an interim nature—for a year and a half period and will comprise the following:</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Reduction of Armed Forces</p>
<p>The Governments of the United Kingdom, the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and France after the coming into force of the present agreement will reduce the strength of their garrisons in West Berlin and correspondingly their armaments to token contingents so that the total strength of these garrisons should not exceed 3,000 to 4,000 men.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Non-Location of Atomic and Rocket Weapons</p>
<p>The Governments of the United Kingdom, the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and France shall not locate in West Berlin nuclear weapons or rocket installations of any kind.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Termination of Subversive Activities</p>
<p>The Governments of the United Kingdom, the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and France will take measures not to allow the use of the territory of West Berlin for interference in the internal affairs of other states and for all kinds of subversive activities directed against the USSR, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and other socialist states as well as for hostile propaganda against them.</p>
<p>(Also included is a reference to the relevant declaration of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Government dealing with noninterference in the internal affairs of West Berlin and respect for the agreement on the interim status of West Berlin.)</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Supervisory Committee</p>
<p>To supervise the fulfillment of the obligations stemming from the present agreement regarding agreed measures in West Berlin, and to take, in case of necessity, measures assuring the implementation of the arrangement arrived at, a committee composed of representatives of the United Kingdom, the USSR, the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and France will be set up within a month of the date the agreement comes into force.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Access</p>
<p>The Governments of the United Kingdom, the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and France take cognizance of the declaration of the Government of the USSR that for the duration of the present agreement the communications of West Berlin with the outside world will be preserved in their present shape.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">Negotiations Between the Two German States</p>
<p>The Four Powers—the United Kingdom, the USSR, the <gloss target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and France have pronounced themselves in favour of setting up an all-German committee composed of the representatives of the two parts of Germany, <pb xml:id="pg_1085" n="1085" facs="1110"/>or holding negotiations between the two German states in some other form acceptable to them to consider questions related to the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany which would also ensure a radical solution of the question of West Berlin, and to consider and work out concrete measures on the unification of Germany and the development of contacts.</p>
<p>It is understood that in the course of these negotiations all decisions will be taken by agreement between the sides:</p>
<p>If after the expiration of the year and a half period no agreement will have been reached on the questions under consideration within the all-German committee or otherwise, then the states represented at the Geneva conference will again hold negotiations on the question of West Berlin. <hi rend="italic">End text.</hi></p>

Our impression from discussion is that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is under considerable pressure to obtain Western concessions on troop issue and would be prepared to pay the price of dropping the link. In reply to repeated questioning by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> Secretary indicated that Soviet concession on link could have some bearing on Western attitude toward reduction of troop levels, but he carefully eschewed language that could be interpreted by Soviets as a commitment. Secretary informed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> he must leave Geneva next Wednesday to attend Santiago Conference and suggested, if no agreement by then, negotiations be continued at Deputy level or recessed. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> rejected both suggestions on ground they would not be understood or accepted by world public opinion; he said only solution was to speed up tempo of <pb xml:id="pg_1087" n="1087" facs="1112"/>negotiations in effort to reach agreement by Wednesday. His remarks on this point carried definite indication that he himself is anxious and probably under some pressure to bring negotiations to an early end.</p>
<p>Following additional points emerged from detailed discussion of Soviet and Western positions on various aspects of Berlin settlement as reflected by July 28 papers:</p>
<p>1. Preamble Secretary objected to statement in Soviet preamble that objective of settlement is to change situation in Berlin on ground this seemed convey impression of liquidation of Western rights. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he was prepared to drop entire preamble and substitute therefor a simple introductory clause reading: “Foreign Ministers have agreed on the following arrangements with regard to Berlin to be in force for ‘X period’.” The Secretary said he would consider <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s suggestion.</p>
<p>2. Troop Reductions. In pressing for Western concession on troop level issue, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> repeated his old argument that this would constitute proof of West’s willingness to cooperate in reduction of tensions. Prodded by <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> expressed view that a Berlin settlement without provision for reduction of Western troop levels would be “senseless”. When queried by Secretary as to why Soviet July 28 paper extends reductions to armaments, as well as troop levels, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that this was a repetition of June 9 language and simply reflected logical assumption that if troops leave, their weapons go also.</p>
<p>3. Armament. Discussion revealed that misunderstanding on this point was one of language, not of substance. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made clear that Soviets have in mind only missiles (not rockets) which require ground installation for launching.</p>
<p>4. Activities. Despite Secretary’s firm insistence on absolute reciprocity, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> gave no indication he was prepared to have jurisdiction of Soviet-proposed supervisory committee extended to East Berlin. Nor does he see any merit in assigning responsibility in this field to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He pointed out that before Geneva Conference Soviets had made exhaustive study of problem in Berlin from which they concluded that the only subversive and propaganda activities carried on in East Berlin are those in direct response to similar activities emanating from West Berlin. In any case, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was hopeful that <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> declaration, not yet drafted, would satisfy Western preoccupation with need for reciprocity.</p>
<p>5. Supervisory Committee. As indicated above, Secretary made clear that responsibilities of supervisory committee must cover both parts of Berlin and extend to all obligations undertaken by all parties, including Soviet commitment with regard to access procedures. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pointed out that Western obligations envisaged by agreement were new commitments whereas Soviet declaration was simply <pb xml:id="pg_1088" n="1088" facs="1113"/>confirmation of existing responsibilities on access. In his view, therefore, there was no justification for treating obligations equally from standpoint supervision of their fulfillment. Secretary replied that agreement must be equitable; either all obligations should be subject to inspection or all should be in form of unilateral declarations.</p>
<p>6. Access. While somewhat evasive in his response to Secretary’s probing, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> gave impression that Soviet declaration with regard to access would mean confirmation that Soviet responsibilities extend to civilian as well as military access and that maintenance of present procedures applies to communications between East and West Berlin.</p>
<p>7. Duration. The Secretary asked if language on duration in Western paper was acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. The latter replied that five-year term is unacceptable, that “in absence of reunification” should be deleted as serving no useful purpose, and that “arrangements” should be replaced by “question of West Berlin” as subject of negotiations which would take place on expiration of interim settlement. He made clear that such negotiations would be on basis of present conference composition—that is, four powers with Germans in advisory capacity. When Secretary pointed out that deletion of reference to arrangements could be interpreted as meaning that interim settlement and all prior agreements would expire on eve of negotiations, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> felt this question was academic since any participant would be free to raise any question for discussion so long as it pertained to the Berlin problem.</p>
<p>He reiterated Soviet pledge not take unilateral action during life of interim agreement and subsequent negotiations; as to what situation would be thereafter, he could not say since impossible predict outcome of negotiations. Secretary pressed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to accept principle of continuing validity of interim arrangements, unless altered of dropped by four power agreement, but <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this violates concept of temporary solution and therefore not acceptable.</p>
<p>In discussion of future meetings, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> readily agreed to <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s invitation, relayed by Secretary, to join other Foreign Ministers at lunch tomorrow and made no mention of desirability of meeting in plenary session as he has consistently at previous private meetings.</p>
<p>After <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s departure, Secretary gave full report to West <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s on discussion. All felt <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s apparent anxiety to wind up negotiations could be exploited to West’s advantage. There was general agreement also on need to avoid any indication of possible concession on troop issue until other questions satisfactorily resolved. Otherwise with troop issue in his pocket, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would stiffen position on all other aspects. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested might be advisable leave this question open until subsequent meeting, presumably summit.</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>The full report of my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> today<note n="1" xml:id="d492fn1">See <ref target="#d491">Document 491</ref>.</note> is going forward to the Department tonight. After my reporting on the progress made to the Western Foreign Ministers<note n="2" xml:id="d492fn2">See the last paragraph of <ref target="#d491">Document 491</ref>.</note> they felt that it might be possible to reach an agreement by next Wednesday. The two points on which they based their optimism were: first, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s evident willingness to conclude negotiations by the time of my departure here and second, his indication we would drop the All-German Committee link with an interim settlement of West Berlin provided we made some concession on the total troop numbers. We all agreed it would be foolhardy to make such a concession. In advance of clear-cut agreement on other points since it has now become obvious that this is a matter on which he sets more store than any other as being a symbol of our willingness to recognize the abnormal situation in Berlin as well as our willingness to continue talking with the Russians about it.</p>
<p>I am not as optimistic as my colleagues are but feel there is an outside chance of our making some simple deal involving three principal points: (1) some troop reduction; (2) access to Berlin as at present for both military and civilian personnel; (3) duration of agreement with rights protected when negotiations resumed for something between three and five years.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> knows of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> invitation and advised me [he] considers matter of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit to US and your return visit a settled matter. I cannot emphasize too strongly my feeling desirability release some statement this matter before end of our conference so that the two will not necessarily be directly related in public mind.</p>

<dateline><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1959-07-29">July 29, 1959</date>.</dateline>
<p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Harold</persName>: Thank you for your letters of July twenty-seventh<note n="1" xml:id="d493fn1">One of these letters is printed as <ref target="#d484">Document 484</ref>; the other indicated <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s preference for a Summit meeting September 1–10. (Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot 66 D 204)</note> to which I have given careful thought. In the first place, I am inclined to agree with you that we may have reached the point where little good can come from continuing the talks at Geneva much longer. I would propose that we aim at bringing them to a conclusion about the middle of next week. In any event, Chris will have to leave about then to prepare for the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States which convenes at Santiago, Chile, on August twelfth to consider the explosive situation in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The problem then is what next? The answer seems to me to depend on whether or not <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> will accept our position of June sixteenth on our rights in Berlin with provision for a reasonable moratorium period of at least two and one-half years. If he does so, I would agree that the minimal requirement for progress had been met and that the way would be open for the Foreign Ministers to agree on arrangements for a Summit. Indeed, they could even pass the final decision on the length of the moratorium to the Heads of Government.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my interpretation of what has happened so far at Geneva is that there has been no agreement by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on our rights formula but only a certain clarification of positions and a sharpening of the issues.</p>
<p>This view, I may say, is fully shared by Chris, and he informs me that he has made this very clear to <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName>. Therefore, barring a last-minute shift by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, which I do not entirely exclude, we are faced with an awkward situation where our minimum hope for progress has not been met. To go immediately to a Summit under these conditions would run the grave risk of spectacular failure or unthinkable capitulation.</p>
<p>It was with this in mind that I have been in communication with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> about a visit to the United States.<note n="2" xml:id="d493fn2">At 5 p.m. on July 29 <persName corresp="#p_MMA1">Menshikov</persName> was handed the President’s reply to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> suggesting that the exchange of visits take place in September and later in the fall. The President reiterated to the Chairman that progress at Geneva would facilitate the visit to the United States. See vol. X, Part 1, <ref target="#d101">Documents 101</ref> ff.</note> It seems to me that this <pb xml:id="pg_1091" n="1091" facs="1116"/>would be a logical next step. A ten-day tour by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> through the United States might be most helpful in giving him a better picture of our strength and of our way of life, and would certainly take the crisis edge off the Berlin situation. If, as I expect would be the case, I were to follow this up with a much briefer visit to Moscow, the stage might be set for further progress at the Foreign Ministers’ level which could then lead to a Summit.</p>
<p>As you remember, one of the tasks assigned the Foreign Ministers was to arrange the date and place for a Summit Meeting once they had made adequate progress on substantive issues. I think we must stick to this arrangement. A sudden announcement of an “invitation” by me to a Summit would inevitably lend an additional air of crisis to the Meeting, the very thing we must strive to avoid if we are to achieve any worthwhile results at such a gathering.<note n="3" xml:id="d493fn3">On July 28 a draft of this letter was cabled to <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> for his comments. (<gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 196 to Geneva; Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1333) Other than minor textual changes only two major drafting revisions were made before the message was sent. The first one was moving this paragraph here from the end of the letter. See footnote 4 below.</note></p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has expressed the desire to rest during August so I would envision his visit here taking place in mid-September with my return visit to Moscow to be later arranged. That would open the way toward a Summit some time in November or early December. I recognize of course that <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName> and to a lesser extent <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> might have some concern about such an exchange of visits. Therefore, I would propose to come to London or Paris for a Western Summit some time before <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s arrival here. This would also give me a long overdue opportunity to talk out some of our problems with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>. I would think that such a schedule would fully meet your preoccupations for the next three months. It would take the edge off the crisis and enhance the prospect of useful talks at the Summit.</p>
<p>I realize of course that there is a chance that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> may suddenly give us what we want at Geneva. I had hoped that my exchanges with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would lead to just this result. He must realize that his reception here would be far better if there had been at least a minimum of progress at Geneva. If we do have this helpful development, I would still think it desirable to adhere to my proposal to hold the Summit Meeting in November preferably in Quebec. This would enable me to talk with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in the meantime and to do whatever I can to assure that his attitude during a Summit Meeting is based on maximum understanding of our Western attitudes, power, and resources. I don’t want to overestimate the value of my conversations with and the impact on him of an exposure to the people and facts of life in this country. Nevertheless, <pb xml:id="pg_1092" n="1092" facs="1117"/>I cannot help but believe that the effect might be considerable and it might promote the very result at the Summit which you and I are so eager to achieve. This would be in line with your thinking, as I remember it, incident to your own visit to Moscow.<note n="4" xml:id="d493fn4"><p>The second drafting change was the deletion of part of a paragraph at this point in the text and moving the rest, at the request of <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>; see footnote 3 above. The paragraph originally read:</p>
<p>“However if we should get an unexpectedly favorable reaction from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in the next few days, and if you feel that it is important to you to get the Summit over before September 10th, I will of course instruct Chris to join <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> in trying to work out such arrangements at Geneva. As you remember, one of the tasks assigned the Foreign Ministers was to arrange the date and place for a Summit Meeting once they had made adequate progress on substantive issues. I think we must stick to this arrangement and not face either</p></note></p>
<p>Apart from the substantive considerations, there remains the risk of leakage. I would hope that this matter could be held most securely for a few days to permit determination of the Russian attitude at Geneva.</p>
<p>With warm regard,</p>
<p>As ever,</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 396.1–GE/7–2859)</note> we have following comments on new Soviet proposal handed us last night by <persName corresp="#p_SAA2">Soldatov</persName>.</p>
<p>New Soviet proposal is of course totally unacceptable and in some respects even more objectionable than June 19 proposal. Obligations which bind West are now spelled out in greater detail than in previous <pb xml:id="pg_1093" n="1093" facs="1118"/>Soviet proposals. Furthermore all Western commitments under interim Berlin solution are in form of obligations whereas Soviet undertakings are expressed as unilateral declarations. Text of proposal reflects clear design on part of Soviets to enhance status of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> through reference to conference participants as parties to agreement (which in Soviet view includes <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>), declaration by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> on non-interference, and specifying desirability of negotiations “between German states”.</p>
<p>We have following specific comments on text of new Soviet proposal:</p>
<p>1. In preamble objective is described to change situation on West Berlin. This, coupled with description of measures as of interim nature, would set stage for elimination of Western rights.</p>
<p>2. Extending concept of force reduction to armaments could be claimed to imply Western commitment to restrict forces in West Berlin to light weapons. Might also provide basis for Soviet or <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> claim to inspect military cargo moving to Berlin.</p>
<p>3. Specifying “rocket installations of any kind”, a broader definition than heretofore, could mean Western agreement to eliminate all rocket weapons, such as bazookas, from arsenal available to West Berlin force.</p>
<p>4. With regard to activities, West is obligated to ban in West Berlin interference in internal affairs, subversive activities, and hostile propaganda directed against all Communist states, whereas other side’s undertaking is limited to non-interference in internal affairs of West Berlin and this is simply in form of unilateral declaration by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
<p>5. By including in definition of supervisory committee’s responsibilities the taking of measures to insure implementation of agreement, Soviet proposal could be interpreted as according executive authority to committee. Joint press spokesman has indicated jurisdiction of committee could extend to access although, if this then case, question arises why access clause follows committee clause.</p>
<p>6. In provision dealing with all-German negotiations question, use of phrase “have pronounced themselves in favor of” may reflect Soviet sensitivity to Western criticism that original Soviet proposal for all-German committee embodies element of coercion on two parts of Germany. Furthermore, link between all-German committee and Berlin settlement appears to be maintained, although Soviet press spokesman intimated last night this not necessarily the case.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 433. Private Session. In two and one-half hour private discussion following <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>’s luncheon today, Foreign Ministers went over much the same ground covered by Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at their bilateral talk yesterday<note n="1" xml:id="d495fn1">See <ref target="#d491">Document 491</ref>.</note> except that today’s discussion was focused on Western paper.<note n="2" xml:id="d495fn2">See <ref target="#d488">Document 488</ref>.</note> Western Ministers deliberately avoided mentioning link on assumption that Secretary had elicited from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> as much clarification of Soviet position as can be expected at this stage. Possibly for similar reasons, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> refrained from pressing Western Foreign Ministers on troop level question. Despite persistent questioning, particularly by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> refused to clarify what the situation would be at the end of interim agreement, resorting as in past to bare statement that during life of agreement and ensuing negotiations, Soviets would take no unilateral action. He continued to insist that Western commitments on troop levels, arms, and activities must be supervised but that West should rely on Soviet pledge alone with regard to access. He again rejected Western five year duration proposal and insisted that formula for duration must represent compromise between Western two and one-half year period (which <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> said was totally irrelevant to Berlin problem since it prescribed time within which all German free elections must take place) and Soviet one year proposal.</p>
<p>Thus, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s position on all fundamental points remained unaltered except possibly for slight movement toward West requirement for reciprocity re activities ban reported below. Virtually only change in situation as result of today’s discussion was agreement with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s suggestion to appoint quadripartite working party for purpose attempting work out agreed language on various aspects of Berlin solution for subsequent consideration by Ministers. All Ministers, however, including <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, doubted whether working party could profitably discuss anything but weapons and access formulas since differences on all other points remain deep and fundamental.</p>
<p>Following points in addition to those brought out in yesterday’s bilateral meeting emerged from today’s discussion:</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1095" n="1095" facs="1120"/>
<p>1. Troop levels: <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> saw no justification for including statement of Soviet intention no longer to maintain forces in Berlin in view of West’s refusal to withdraw their troops.</p>
<p>2. Armaments: While there was general agreement that no misunderstanding existed on this point, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> expressed his position in somewhat different terms from yesterday when he said Soviets had in mind missiles requiring ground installation for launching. He now says that while Soviet formula referring to “rockets” covers weapons only, it is not confined to ballistic weapons.</p>
<p>3. Activities: <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> conceded that Soviet-proposed Supervisory Committee could hear complaints on activities in both East and West Berlin. He made clear that Soviet preference for specific language and objection to Western formula was based on Soviet suspicion that latter would allow such broad latitude of interpretation to West Berlin authorities that all activities could be encompassed in fundamental liberty reservation and there would be no change in situation. When Secretary suggested that best solution might be for each side to declare intention reduce activities in both parts of Berlin without requirement for supervision, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied Soviets could not commit <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> whereas West, as occupation bosses in West Berlin, could order <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> to comply.</p>
<p>4. Supervisory Committee: In re-stating Western refusal to permit supervision of Western obligations on troop, levels and armaments, <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> pointed out that Governments would be directly responsible for implementation of these obligations whereas this would not be true of obligation to effect reduction propaganda and subversive activities. Any complaint, therefore, of failure to carry out such obligations would be a matter for discussion between Govts and not by any commission.</p>
<p>5. Duration: In discussion of this point, Western Powers attempted to pin <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> down on what would be situation at end of agreement. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> saw only two possibilities: either status quo ante with lapse of obligations undertaken by parties to interim agreement—that is, present situation; or prolongation of agreement—that is, present situation as modified by agreement. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> gave stock evasive reply that in negotiations to follow expiry of agreement any party could raise any question relating to Berlin.</p>
<p>It was agreed that Quadripartite Working Party would meet tomorrow at 11:30 and Ministers would meet at <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s for “Working Tea” at 4:00 p.m. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> again made no mention of desirability of holding early plenary session.</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>Western Foreign Ministers talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> today<note n="1" xml:id="d496fn1">See <ref target="#d495">Document 495</ref>.</note> made clearer that three major unresolved points will make agreement very difficult. The first deals with the continuation of Allied rights in Berlin on which we feel it essential to get some language which in light of past Russian statements and threats will give us strength in any renewed negotiations after possible moratorium for few years. The second is the Soviet increasing insistence on some reduction in troop levels in Berlin which to them appears to be almost a sine qua non in order to show: a) that they have made tangible progress in changing status quo Berlin; b) this beginning of liquidation of occupation rights; c) such a shock to morale Berliners as to begin a psychological deterioration of real importance. Third, the linkage of direct all-German talks with the time limit to be put on any temporary moratorium agreement on Berlin.</p>
<p>We consider the first point a practical necessity. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> agrees but <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> very wobbly. On second point, all my advisers here as well as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> and military, including commanding officer Berlin, <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>, and Pentagon, strongly opposed any reduction beyond present levels but willing to place ceiling at that point.<note n="2" xml:id="d496fn2">These conclusions were made in a July 29 paper that included the comments of <persName corresp="#p_HMGB1">Hamlett</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and the Department of State. (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot 64 D 560, <gloss target="#t_CF1">CF</gloss> 1282)</note> <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> and Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Willy Brandt</persName> bitterly opposed any reduction not so much for military reasons as for psychological reasons. I am personally terribly reluctant to make any concessions this point. <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> feels we could get agreement at level somewhere between 8,000 to 10,000 and would favor this if it were last sticking point towards agreement. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> takes same position as <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName> but insistent this be kept as very final concession. On third point, impossible accept all-German committee in form proposed by Soviets since impossible to get West German concurrence and hence pledge by us no value. All three of us feel we cannot go beyond substitute four-power committee with German advisers which we have offered and believe Soviets would as last resort accept this rather than nothing. Also feel Soviets likely to drop linkage if they can get concession on point 2.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1097" n="1097" facs="1122"/>
<p>Remembering <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster Dulles</persName>’ own feeling which as I recall you shared that troop numbers in Berlin were negotiable point, I would deeply appreciate your personal reaction on this and the other two points mentioned.</p>
<p>It is just possible of course that we could not reach agreement because of rights issue and that troop levels might not come to decision. However, we must be prepared on this point, since it might even become quid pro quo for acceptance wording assuring our rights.<note n="3" xml:id="d496fn3"><p>On July 31 the President replied:</p>
<p>“I agree with you that it is essential to obtain agreements satisfactory to us on points one and three . . . . Provided we have obtained firm agreement on these two items, I would be prepared to accept a unilateral statement by Western powers that they would limit their forces in Berlin to a figure such as that mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_CDMM1">Couve</persName>. In my opinion this is clearly a political and psychological matter and has no military importance. A modest reduction of this order should not cause lasting discouragement in Berlin. If such a modest reduction in forces becomes necessary we should make every effort to put it in its true light to the Berliners and the West Germans and be willing to accept some temporary discouragement as the price for a sound agreement on the issues of basic importance to us.” (<gloss target="#t_Tocah1">Tocah</gloss> 219 to Geneva; July 31; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., Central Files, 110.11–HE/7–3159)</p></note></p>

He was in relaxed mood and had already received and studied President’s message <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> and had begun to draft reply.</p>
<p>Most significant of his comments to me seemed to be acknowledgment, albeit unenthusiastic, that he now realizes impracticality endeavoring <pb xml:id="pg_1098" n="1098" facs="1123"/>to prepare for and hold full “summit” meeting prior to September 10. I am not sure, however, that his reply will clearly make this point.</p>
<p>Although, as I expected, he expressed doubts regarding idea of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s meeting meanwhile with President, he believes it important that we press forward with earliest possible announcement regarding “summit” and meanwhile make every effort, before Foreign Ministers’ discussions wind up in Geneva, to take as practical positions as possible, especially in view of invitation outstanding. I did not find his reservations regarding <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s meeting with the President very sound, and argued that we would be following in his footsteps and performing service for and with full approval of the Alliance.</p>

<dateline><placeName>London</placeName>, <date when="1959-07-30">July 30, 1959</date>.</dateline>
<p>Dear Friend, I was glad to get your message of July 29.<note n="1" xml:id="d498fn1"><ref target="#d493">Document 493</ref>.</note> I agree that the talks at Geneva must be brought to a conclusion within the next days. The latest reports from there suggest that there is now a chance of making some further last-minute progress. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seems to be showing signs of wanting to do business. I hope we shall not discourage him. After all, we are not at this stage aiming at more than an interim settlement on Berlin. And, if we are asking for a moratorium, we cannot expect that our rights should be guaranteed beyond the end of the renewed negotiations. That surely is what a moratorium means.</p>
<p>We may therefore get within the next few days a conclusion at Geneva which you could regard as progress. On further reflection however I agree with you that even if that happens it would not be wise to try to proceed at once to a Summit meeting. A later date would now be more convenient for us all.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1099" n="1099" facs="1124"/>
<p>Therefore I am in broad agreement with the timetable which you now have in mind:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) A Western Summit before the end of August;</item>
<item>(2) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s visit to you and your return visits during September and October; and</item>
<item>(3) A full Summit meeting in November. Quebec would suit me very well. I am very happy to know that in your journeys you will be able to include a visit to us.</item>
</list>
<p>I am not sure whether it will be necessary to interpose a further meeting of Foreign Ministers between (2) and (3). If the Foreign Ministers make substantial progress over the next few days they may be able to take up, before they recess, their duty of discussing arrangements for a Summit meeting. Indeed it may be difficult for us to decline to do so if <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> raises the question; for, as you yourself say, it was one of the tasks remitted to them. They may themselves be able to recommend a date in November. On the other hand, if this is not possible the time and place could be arranged during <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s visit to you. In any case it does not seem likely that there will be much further progress which the Foreign Ministers could make at an adjourned meeting in the autumn before a Summit.</p>
<p>I hope therefore that we can get agreement between all the Western Powers on the following programme for further negotiations in the coming months:</p>
<list>
<item>(1) We should aim to secure that the Geneva meeting is recessed next week either with a Summit fixed or on a basis which will enable us to claim that some progress has been made and that we can look forward to further negotiations.</item>
<item>(2) We should hold a Western Summit in Paris before the end of August, at which the Heads of the Western Governments would review the results of the Geneva meeting.</item>
<item>(3) This would be followed by a period of personal contacts between yourself and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> during which exploratory discussions would continue.</item>
<item>(4) As a result of all these preparations, a full Summit before the end of the year, not in an atmosphere of crisis, but with a prospect of success based on these intermediate stages of negotiation and discussion.</item>
</list>
<p>I do not believe that we can present a firm Western position to public opinion unless we can say that the process of negotiation will continue over the coming months and culminate in a Summit meeting before the end of the year. Certainly for opinion here it is of first importance that we should make it plain as quickly as we can that there will be a Western Summit before the end of August and that a full Summit will follow later in the year.</p>
<p>I hear that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> is doubtful about the need to hold a Western Summit before <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s visit to you. I do not understand why he is <pb xml:id="pg_1100" n="1100" facs="1125"/>taking this view. For my part I should welcome the opportunity for consultation before you see <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and I think it very important that this should take place. It really is essential that the Western Governments should be able to take stock of the position and clear their lines before <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s visit. Moreover, I know that you also want to talk to <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> about other matters and I am sure that this is most important and urgent. I hope therefore that you will feel able to press <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> very strongly to fall in with your plan for a Western Summit in Paris in August. In the last resort, if he proves obdurate, I would prefer to hold a Western Summit in London with France represented by Debre rather than defer it until after <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s visit.</p>
<p>I believe that you and I are pretty well at one on a plan for continued negotiations in the months ahead. There is, I think, only one real difference between us. You are reluctant to say now that there will be a Summit meeting, though I believe that you recognize that it is in fact inevitable. I, on the other hand, should like to get it settled and announced now that there will be such a meeting before the end of the year. This is not because I want a Summit for its own sake. I have never wanted that. What I have wanted is a settlement, and I have always believed that a settlement could only be reached by negotiation between Heads of Government. Nothing that has happened at Geneva has made me revise this opinion. Indeed it has confirmed me in the view that if we are to reach a settlement we must do so at a Summit meeting.</p>
<p>With warm regards,</p>
<p>As ever,</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 442. Secretary saw <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> this morning at latter’s request. Foreign Minister expressed concern over recent developments at Geneva, particularly alleged trend on part Western powers towards <pb xml:id="pg_1101" n="1101" facs="1126"/>making additional concessions. He argued that breakup of conference would be preferable to further concessions which would only increase Soviet appetite. Could not see how in face of continuing Soviet intransigence, there was any possibility of agreement in last few days before departure of Secretary.</p>
<p>Secretary pointed out that Western position was not weak but continuingly firm on basic issues. West would stand fast on preservation of rights and unacceptability of all-German committee. Issue of troop levels had acquired psychological as well as purely numerical aspect. Western powers agreed they would only discuss this if it were last outstanding item and there were compensatory advantages in rest of arrangements agreed. Secretary said he considered it highly unlikely we would reach this point in discussions or that agreement could be attained by Wednesday. Such agreement would require significant change in Soviet position.</p>
<p>Secretary noted that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was undoubtedly creating impression that Soviets were willing continue negotiating and that any breakdown of conference was due to Western powers acting under pressure from <gloss target="#t_FedRep1">FedRep</gloss>. Impression would be particularly bad, Secretary noted, if through pessimistic press accounts, such as had been appearing during last twenty-four hours in German newspapers, impression were created that West Germans were applying pressures on other Western powers to strengthen determination against making unacceptable concessions.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> said he agreed such impression would be most unfortunate and intimated he had not come in effort exert pressure on Secretary but merely to obtain privately benefit of his views as well as to express his personal concern over developments of last few days. He noted that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was undoubtedly aware of heavy pressures from Prime Minister under which <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> was working and took this into account in calculating strength of Western position. <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> urged that Secretary assert himself more clearly as spokesman for West even though this might mean offending certain sensibilities.</p>
<p>At initiative <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> luncheon hastily improvised for today to give Secretary opportunity talk with Governing Mayor <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> who arrived in Geneva yesterday evening on invitation German Foreign Minister.<note n="1" xml:id="d499fn1">The U.S. Delegation reported in <gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 443, July 31, that <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BW2">Brandt</persName> went over the same ground in their conversation following the lunch at 1:15. p.m. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files, 396.1–GE/7–3159)</note></p>

Two hour meeting of experts this morning and two and one-half hour private discussion of Foreign Ministers this afternoon at <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s “working tea” were unproductive.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers devoted most of afternoon to persistent probing on what juridical situation would be at the end of an interim agreement but their efforts succeeded only in eliciting from <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> virtually the same evasive and unresponsive statements which he has repeated untiringly since private sessions began. Only variation in <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> theme was his statement that at end of interim period a “certain situation” would obtain, but he refused to define what this would be. In other respects, his replies were identical with past responses—i.e., that agreement would expire at the end of the prescribed period, that negotiations at which participants would have right to raise any questions pertaining to Berlin would then begin, and that during negotiations Soviet Union would refrain from unilateral action. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> characterized persistent efforts by all three Western Foreign Ministers to ascertain if Soviet position was that situation at end of agreement would revert to status quo ante as efforts to raise troublesome questions of rights and future of occupation regime which could only serve to complicate negotiations. Western Foreign Ministers he said are suspicious of Soviet motives and have no justification for being so. He called upon Western Foreign Ministers to concentrate on discussion of concrete interim arrangements on which agreement seemed feasible rather than focusing their attention on questions—meaning Allied rights—on which agreement impossible.</p>
<p>The other subject discussed by Ministers was question of activities, particularly procedure for ensuring compliance with obligations to be undertaken by both sides. While stressing that Soviet Union, unlike Western powers which “occupation bosses” of West Berlin, could not undertake commitments in East Berlin on behalf of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> offered to consult East German delegation on nature of commitment <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> would be willing to assume with view toward producing new Soviet <pb xml:id="pg_1103" n="1103" facs="1128"/>language embodying principle of reciprocity on which West insisting. He again made clear however that proposal containing language on fundamental rights and liberties would be unacceptable since this would be exploited as at present to justify continued West Berlin subversive and hostile propaganda activities.</p>
<p>Although confirming that four power supervisory committee would be entitled to hear complaints on activities in both East and West Berlin, he now implied commission must discuss any required corrective measures directly with <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authorities. In other words, Soviet element on committee would not undertake responsibility for East Berlin as Western elements would be expected to for West Berlin. Meanwhile <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued to insist that responsibilities of four power supervisory committee must also extend to supervision of Western commitments on troop levels and armaments but not to Soviet responsibilities with regard to access.</p>
<p>It was agreed that Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> who lunch together tomorrow would discuss arrangements for future meetings. Meanwhile Deputies could arrange meeting of experts if any side has new proposals to offer.</p>

<p>1. <hi rend="italic">Begin text</hi></p>
<p>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>: Federal Minister Lemmer has officially reported to me the conversation which you had with him in the presence of <pb xml:id="pg_1104" n="1104" facs="1129"/>Mayor <persName corresp="#p_AF1">Amrehn</persName> during your visit to Berlin.<note n="1" xml:id="d501fn1">See <ref target="#d478">Document 478</ref>.</note> From his description of this conversation I am forced to assume that you are not correctly informed about my position on the question of reunification. To make this position clear I am accordingly making the following remarks.</p>
<p>In the Soviet view, as has become clear recently in the statements of the all-powerful leader <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, any liberation of the Germans in the Soviet Zone from Soviet hegemony is as little likely at the present time through political means as is the liberation of the population of the satellite states from the same regime. The Soviet Union would approve the reunification of the Federal Republic and the Soviet Zone in the foreseeable future only under conditions which would insure the dominance of communism in West Germany. Such a reunification I refuse; since through it the seventeen million Germans in the Soviet Zone would not be helped and since the fifty million Germans who have been free up to the present would be enslaved, merely to comply with a formalistic conception of reunification. It would be evidence of lack of understanding of the character of a totalitarian regime if one were to suppose that, through linking a communistic with a democratic system in a single state, a mere equilibrium of forces could be achieved. Even under better conditions, to name just a few examples, the democratic systems in the Baltic States or in Czechoslovakia, could not endure, although the overwhelming majority of the populations was not communist. I must therefore maintain my reserve against all proposals which in order to achieve reunification would endanger freedom. I therefore also reject the “German plan” of the <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss><note n="2" xml:id="d501fn2">See <ref target="#d254fn3">footnote 3, Document 254</ref>.</note> and similar proposals. Only when the free West through its policies has achieved a condition under which the Soviet Union no longer regards the Soviet Zone of Germany as an important strong-point in the conflict between the East and the West and therefore abandons the maintenance of the Communist system in the Soviet Zone, will reunification and freedom become a political possibility. Under such conditions, in my view, reunification must be achieved as quickly as possible without regard to the internal political consequences which would result or to the economic sacrifices which might be involved for the population of the present Federal Republic.</p>
<p>You told me when taking over your office that you would like to have develop between you and me the same official and friendly relationships that existed between <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName> and me. This is also my wish. The relationships between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and myself rested upon fullest mutual frankness and truthfulness. I believe that my frank explanation should dispel any lack of clarity about my position and should <pb xml:id="pg_1105" n="1105" facs="1130"/>serve to deepen our relationship. With this motive in mind I send you the present letter. Signed <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>.</p>

<p><gloss target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 450. Moscow, Paris, London, Bonn, Berlin eyes only Ambassador and <persName corresp="#p_GB1">Gufler</persName> respectively. Private Session. Following lunch today Secretary discussed rights question with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> for almost three hours. Despite persistent and concentrated grilling by Secretary with aim of eliciting clear statement that Soviets acknowledge interim agreement does not affect juridical situation, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s response was essentially verbatim repetition of position expressed at yesterday’s private meeting of four Foreign Ministers.<note n="1" xml:id="d502fn1">See <ref target="#d500">Document 500</ref>.</note> As result of Secretary’s repeated stress on fundamental importance West attaches to clarification of rights question, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> now should clearly understand no agreement is possible without explicit understanding that rights remain unimpaired.</p>
<p>Secretary began discussion by informing <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that what West seeks is not Soviet acknowledgment of permanency of occupation rights but simply statement that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agrees juridical situation at end of interim agreement will be exactly same as now. Clarification of this question, Secretary said, was essential for West especially in view of <pb xml:id="pg_1106" n="1106" facs="1131"/>past Soviet statements, for example those in June 9 proposal,<note n="2" xml:id="d502fn2">See <ref target="#d377">Document 377</ref>.</note>
 that Soviet intention is to extinguish Allied rights. It would meet West’s requirement in this respect if Soviets were prepared to include in text of interim Berlin settlement a statement that agreement in no way involves the question of rights.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> could not agree that text should include such a statement since this would oblige each side publicly to express its position on rights question and this would only complicate situation. West’s position is that occupation regime should be continued indefinitely; Soviet position is that occupation regime is outmoded and should be ended. Best way to forestall public expression of such sharply conflicting positions would be to avoid any mention of rights in text of temporary agreement. It should be confined to definition of agreed concrete arrangements for prescribed period in Berlin. Secretary should understand that Soviet June 9 proposal was superseded by June 19 proposal which prescribes not end of occupation regime but beginning of negotiations when interim agreement expires.</p>
<p>Secretary pointed out that if, as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> maintains, occupation regime does not automatically end at expiration of interim agreement then presumably Allied rights would remain valid. While this appeared to be logical implication of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s position, his refusal to make clear statement to this effect raised question in Secretary’s mind as to real Soviet intentions. It is precisely to remove the suspicion that the Soviets regard an interim agreement as a first step toward ultimate liquidation of Allied rights that West must have unequivocal understanding that Soviets agree juridical situation would remain unchanged.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied this was impossible request to put to Soviets. He would be prepared to say that question of rights was not raised in connection with negotiation of interim agreement; but he could not agree to inclusion in text of agreement of statement that agreement does not involve rights. Latter would be construed as Soviet endorsement of prolongation of occupation regime which would be directly contrary to Soviet position. Secretary then said he must be completely frank with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. He should understand that so long as any doubt exists in Secretary’s mind as to Soviet intentions with regard to Allied rights no interim agreement of any kind would be possible. Despite <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s repeated assurances that West’s suspicions are unfounded, Secretary could not avoid feeling that his evasive behavior during recent days’ discussions of rights question means that Soviets do in fact regard interim agreements as significant step toward ultimate liquidation of Allied rights. The Secretary said that the longer this discussion went on the more convinced he became of this.</p>
<p>As the Secretary left, he asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> if, in likely event of failure to reach agreement by Wednesday, he would be willing to agree to recess <pb xml:id="pg_1107" n="1107" facs="1132"/>negotiations until September when all Foreign Ministers would be in US for <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> Session. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he did not favor recess “without some results”, but indicated he would be prepared discuss subject further.</p>
<p>No quadripartite meetings scheduled, but <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> lunches with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> Monday.</p>
<p>Following meeting, Western Foreign Ministers reviewed situation at Villa Greta. They agreed that question of rights was absolute sticking point. It was also agreed that Western coordinating group would meet tomorrow to review positions in order to be prepared in improbable eventuality that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at last moment might give on rights issue.</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>After my Saturday talk with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d503fn1">See <ref target="#d502">Document 502</ref>.</note> and a somewhat similar one <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> had with him yesterday, it seems probable that we shall spend the next two days trying to find a satisfactory method of disengaging. We are hoping this can be done by agreement, but <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> appears to want a complete end to our talks. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> is sounding him out on this now. While none of us are happy that after such a long period of time we could not have come up with a better result, the one cheering thing is that all four Western Foreign Ministers are in complete agreement with respect to our position as of now. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn</persName> is being very stout even though his backing from home is wobbly.</p>
<p>I hope it will be possible for me to see you Thursday afternoon soon after my return.</p>
<p>Faithfully, signed: Chris.”</p>

<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> lunched with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> today and at subsequent meeting of Western Foreign Ministers reported that there has been little discussion of substance other than a short exchange on the subject of rights. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had floated a suggestion that agreement might be reached on language which read “these arrangements with respect to Berlin do not deal with rights” but he did not press this proposal when <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> replied negatively.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> then handed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> the following text of draft communiqué which had been agreed by Western Foreign Ministers: “The Foreign Ministers of the French Republic, the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America met in Geneva from May 11 to June 20 and from July 13 to August 5, 1959, to consider questions relating to Germany, including a peace treaty with Germany and the question of Berlin. They endeavored to narrow the differences between the respective points of view on these questions but despite frank and comprehensive discussions were unable to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>“The Foreign Ministers have therefore agreed to report the result of their discussions to their respective heads of government and to recommend that the date and place for the resumption of the discussions should be settled through diplomatic channels.”</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not take particular exception to the draft but said he would prefer a longer document. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had replied that it was too late to try to work out a long document and that it was better to fully agree on something brief.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested that the final plenary could be held Wednesday morning, thus allowing time for it to run over into the afternoon if necessary. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not take exception but said he would like to think it over. Asked if he wanted a private meeting tomorrow, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> showed no particular interest but said he would be glad to come to lunch if invited. Western Foreign Ministers agreed to lunch with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s house. It is expected that the conversation will deal principally with the problem of the communiqué.</p>

<dateline><placeName>Geneva</placeName>, <date when="1959-08-03">August 3, 1959</date>.</dateline>
<p>Dear Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Adenauer</persName>: I appreciated receiving your frank expression of views<note n="1" xml:id="d505fn1">See <ref target="#d501">Document 501</ref>.</note> on the question of German reunification. As you indicated, such frankness is a necessary ingredient of the kind of relationship of mutual trust and friendship which, I know, we both wish to have develop between us. This is something which I not only personally desire, but which I believe to be essential to the fullest harmonization of the policies of our Governments.</p>
<p>It is impossible to disagree with your realistic view that the Soviets will not permit the reunification of Germany, except on terms implying the communization of the entire country, until a possible point has been reached where they are willing to consider abandoning the communist system in the Soviet Zone because they no longer regard this area as significant in the conflict between the East and the West. This has been amply evidenced by the position taken by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on reunification during the course of the current Geneva Conference. I need not tell you, however, that constant pressure from the West in advocacy of reunification is required to keep before the eyes of the world and the German people the harsh reality of Soviet obduracy which lies at the bottom of the continued division of the country.</p>
<p>I regret very much if my luncheon remarks to Federal Minister Lemmer gave the impression that I was not fully aware of the basic agreement in our thinking in this matter. You will undoubtedly have received from Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BHV1">Von Brentano</persName> full reports of the position consistently taken by the Western Powers at Geneva in rejecting the Soviet proposal for an all-German committee. Through the instrumentality of such a body; the Soviets presumably would hope to move towards their dual objectives of enhancing the status of the so-called German Democratic Republic and maximizing the influence of communism throughout the Federal Republic without contributing in the slightest to the achievement of that reunification in freedom which can be the only kind of reunification acceptable to the West.</p>
<p>With warmest personal regards,</p>
<p>Most sincerely,</p>

<head>SUBJECT</head>
<item>Private Discussions of Final Communiqué</item>
</list>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">A. At <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s Villa</p>
<p>Before proceeding to a discussion of the Western draft communiqué which <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> had handed <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on August 3 (Annex A),<note n="1" xml:id="d506fn1">Annex A is not printed; for text of this draft, see <ref target="#d504">Document 504</ref>.</note> the Ministers exchanged views on how the conference should end. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Ministers should decide whether the conference would end on August 5 or should remain in session: <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> pointed out that practical considerations made it desirable to agree that the conference would terminate on August 5. In the first place, as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was aware, the Secretary would have to leave on August 6 in order to attend the Santiago Conference. Secondly it would be useful to have an interval for careful examination of the two sides’ positions on the questions before the conference since despite long and intensive discussion there remained fundamental differences between the two sides on important issues of substance.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1111" n="1111" facs="1136"/>
<p>Turning to the Western draft communiqué, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> suggested the desirability of specifying areas of agreement and disagreement, including some reference to a Summit Conference, spelling out in greater detail the problems on which the conference in both plenary and private sessions focused. He could not accept the Western statement specifying the conference participants as the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers; while he would prefer to mention the six powers represented at the conference, he would be prepared to accept simply “the Foreign Ministers”.</p>
<p>The Western Foreign Ministers concurred in the latter suggestion since this was the formula used in the recess communiqué. They believed, however, that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s general prescription for a final communiqué would involve lengthy and difficult negotiations. It would not be easy, for example, for the two sides to agree on language setting forth areas of agreement and disagreement. If this were done, the West would have to insist on making specific reference to the question of Allied rights; this alone would require going over much the same ground that had been covered in recent private sessions. With regard to a Summit Conference, the Western Foreign Ministers could not agree to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s suggestion that the communiqué reflect agreement on the desirability of a Heads of Government meeting since this decision should be reserved for the Heads of Government themselves in the light of reports by their Foreign Ministers. In the Western view, therefore, it was desirable to work toward a brief communiqué which could be easily and quickly agreed upon.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> continued to believe that the communiqué should attempt to spell out the problems on which some progress had been made and those which required further discussion. While he would not insist on referring to a Summit Conference in view of the attitude of the Western Foreign Ministers, he still felt that the communiqué should touch upon problems other than the Berlin settlement that were discussed during the negotiations. He had in mind, for example, such questions as a peace treaty, European security, and disarmament.</p>
<p>It was pointed out that even this amended formula of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s would involve points of sharp controversy on which it would be difficult to work out agreed language. If <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> were to insist, for example, on mentioning the peace treaty question, the Western Foreign Ministers would have to insist on mentioning the problem of reunification.With regard to disarmament, it was suggested that this be covered in a separate communiqué since the discussions of procedures for continuing disarmament negotiations had taken place outside the conference.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1112" n="1112" facs="1137"/>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed with the latter suggestion. He also agreed to produce a draft communiqué which would incorporate the points which he felt should be mentioned.</p>
<p>At <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName>’s suggestion, it was agreed that Soviet and Western draft communiqués would be discussed by deputies at a meeting at Les Ormeaux at 6:00 p.m. and that the Foreign Ministers would meet at <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s villa at 9:30 p.m. to consider the results of the deputies’ discussion.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">B. At Les Ormeaux</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> tabled the Soviet draft communiqué promised earlier by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> (Annex B). There appeared to be tentative agreement on a compromise formula to replace the first five paragraphs of the Soviet draft (Annex C). At the last moment, however, <persName corresp="#p_ZVA1">Zorin</persName> withdrew his agreement to the compromise language, and the Western deputies thereupon withdrew their tentative approval also. The Western deputies did not object strenuously to paragraphs 6 and 7, the sharp disagreement on fundamental issues which the discussions had revealed and that the problems of mutual interest mentioned in paragraph 7 would be difficult to define. They pointed out that paragraphs 8 and 9 related to disarmament which they understood the Ministers had agreed would be covered in a separate communiqué. The result was that no progress was made at the deputies meeting except for agreement on the first and last two paragraphs of the Soviet draft, and the Foreign Ministers at 9:30 faced the task of beginning the negotiations anew.</p>
<p rend="sectiontitleital">C. At <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s Residence</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministers discussed paragraph by paragraph the Soviet draft communiqué and ultimately reached agreement on a version which was ultimately adopted at the Plenary Session on August 5 (Annex D).<note n="2" xml:id="d506fn2">Annex D is not printed; for text of the final communiqué, see <ref target="#d507">Document 507</ref>.</note></p>
<p>In the course of the discussion, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pressed hard for Western acceptance of language referring to an interim settlement without relating it to Berlin. But the Western Foreign Ministers would have none of this, however, and it was finally agreed not to refer to an interim settlement at all. The Secretary opposed including in the communiqué <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s statement that the discussions had been carried on in an atmosphere of “complete candor”. He pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s persistent refusal to provide direct answers to Western inquiries with regard to the status of Western rights at the end of an interim agreement was anything but candor on <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s part. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> finally agreed to limit the description of the negotiations to “frank and comprehensive”.</p>
<pb xml:id="pg_1113" n="1113" facs="1138"/>
<p>Asked how press inquiries on the meaning of “useful exchanges of views on other questions” should be handled, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> suggested that the press be informed that such questions related to European security, non-aggression undertakings, and problems of a strictly bilateral nature.</p>
<p><persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> readily accepted the Western suggestion that the communiqué should specify that the Foreign Ministers would report to their respective Governments, not to Heads of Government. He remarked wryly, however, that the reference to Heads of Government had been included in the original Western draft and he felt this was again a case of withdrawal of a Western suggestion when it was accepted by the Soviet side.</p>
<p>After there appeared to be full agreement on the text of the communiqué, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> questioned the use of the preposition “in” in the expression “participants in the conference”. He insisted that the preposition “of” should be used since he was convinced that use of “in” altered the meaning of the phrase. He implied that the West’s insistence on “in” was designed to prevent an interpretation that the East Germans had participated in the conference. In a rather sharp exchange, <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> said that he thought it was inappropriate for <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to tell the Western Foreign Ministers how the English language should be written; after all, he would not attempt to criticize <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>’s use of certain words in the Russian language. The hour-long controversy over the use of the words “of” and “in” finally ended on the understanding that the question would remain open until the following day by which time, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said, he expected to conclude his research on the problem. (<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not raise the issue again, and the communiqué which appears as Annex D was adopted at the plenary session on August 5.)</p>
<p>It was agreed that a plenary session should be held on August 5 and <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested that it begin at 1100, pointing out he hoped to be in London before 1900. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> disagreed, saying that the past practice of holding plenary sessions at 1530 should be continued. <persName corresp="#p_LS1">Lloyd</persName> suggested a compromise time, and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> ultimately agreed to 1430.</p>
