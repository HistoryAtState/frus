                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of
                    State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991, established a new statutory
                    charter for the preparation of the series. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a
                    new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22
                    U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>This statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded.</p>

                        Relations</hi> Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard M.
                        Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald R. Ford</persName>.
                    This specific volume documents the foundations of U.S. foreign policy,
                    1973–1976. Documentation on <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s
                    first administration can be found in <ref target="frus1969-76v01">volume I,

                        rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969–1976, Volume XXXVIII, Part 1</p>
                <p>The purpose of this volume is to document the intellectual foundations of the
                    foreign policy of the second <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administrations. The
                    documentation explores the collective mindset of <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>
                    administration officials on foreign policy issues rather than documenting
                    significant foreign policy decisions or diplomatic exchanges. The compilation
                    takes as its canvas the entire record of the second <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>
                    administrations. Therefore, the documents selected are necessarily a sampling
                    chosen to illustrate policy perspectives and themes, rather than a thorough
                    record of a bilateral relationship or of a major issue. This volume draws upon
                    the published record of speeches, press releases, press conferences and
                    briefings, interviews, and testimony before Congressional committees to document
                    policy positions and the assumptions of administration officials on the foreign
                    policy process. The editors of the volume sought to present a representative
                    selection of documents chosen to elucidate the primary intellectual themes that
                    ran through and influenced both <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>’s foreign policy: a continued
                    belief in interdependence and cooperation in relation to energy and economic
                    issues, an emphasis upon détente, and the primacy of the executive branch in the
                    formulation and conduct of foreign policy. The documentation chronicles the
                    perspectives of not only <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> but also Secretaries of State
                        <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, Secretaries of Defense <persName
                        corresp="#p_LMR_1">Laird</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                        >Schlesinger</persName>, and others.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversations are placed according to the date and time of the
                    conversation, rather than the date a memorandum was drafted. Documents chosen
                    for printing are authoritative or signed copies, unless otherwise noted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Declassification and
                    Publishing Division. The documents are reproduced as exactly as possible,
                    including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes.
                    Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the
                    publication of historical documents within the limitations of modern typography.
                    A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document included in the
                    volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the
                    original text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected.
                    Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed
                    insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words
                    or phrases underlined in the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations
                    and contractions are preserved as found in the or<pb n="V" facs="0006"
                        xml:id="pg_V"/>iginal text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the
                    front matter of each volume. In telegrams, the telegram number (including
                    special designators such as Secto) is printed at the start of the text of the
                    telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in footnotes.
                    All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used where appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>

                <p>Under the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act
                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 U.S.C. 2111 note), the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California, has
                    custody of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Presidential
                    historical materials. The requirements of the PRMPA and <pb n="VI" facs="0007"

                    PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require the <persName

                    these officials were not given the opportunity to separate their personal
                    materials from public papers. Thus, the PRMPA and implementing public access
                    regulations require the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Library
                    formally to notify the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Estate and

                    recordings is governed by terms of the PRMPA and an access agreement with the
                    Office of Presidential Libraries of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Estate. In
                    February 1971, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> initiated
                    a voice activated taping system in the Oval Office of the White House and,
                    subsequently, in the President’s Office in the Executive Office Building, Camp
                    David, the Cabinet Room, and White House and Camp David telephones. The
                    audiotapes include conversations of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> with his Assistant for National Security Affairs,
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, other White House
                    aides, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>, other
                    Cabinet officers, members of Congress, and key foreign officials. Readers are
                    advised that the tape recording is the official document; the transcript
                    represents an interpretation of that document. The clarity of the voices on the
                    tape recordings is often very poor, but the editor has made every effort to
                    verify the accuracy of the transcripts included in this volume. Through the use
                    of digital audio and other advances in technology, the Office of the Historian
                    has been able to enhance the tape recordings and over time produce more accurate
                    transcripts. The result is that some transcripts printed here may differ from
                    transcripts of the same conversations printed in previous <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> volumes. The most accurate transcripts possible,
                    however, cannot substitute for listening to the recordings. Readers are urged to
                    consult the recordings themselves for a full appreciation of those aspects of
                    the conversations that cannot be captured in a transcript, such as the speakers’
                    inflections and emphases that may convey nuances of meaning, as well as the
                    larger context of the discussion.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department <pb n="VII" facs="0008"
                        xml:id="pg_VII"/>of State of the documents published in this volume. The
                    review was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive
                    Order 12958, as amended, on Classified National Security Information and other
                    applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security, as embodied in
                    law and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2008 and was completed in
                    2012, resulted in the decision to make an excision of a paragraph or more in one
                    document and minor excisions of less than one paragraph in four documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the record presented here provides an accurate and
                    comprehensive account of the foundations of U.S foreign policy between 1973 and
                    1976.</p>

                    Series</p>
                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
                    significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in
                    foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department
                    of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to
                    foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected
                    records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have
                    been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. The Department’s indexed central files through
                    December 1975 have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and
                    Records Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). Many of the
                    Department’s decentralized office files covering the 1969–1976 period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred, or
                    are in the process of being transferred, from the Department’s custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                    and Ford and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers
                    maintained and preserved at the Presidential libraries and formerly at the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Project
                    at Archives II include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related
                    documentation from the Department of State and other Federal agencies including
                    the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department
                    of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dr. Henry Kissinger has approved
                    access to his papers at the Library of Congress. These papers are an important
                    source for the Nixon-Ford subseries of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                    Relations</hi>.</p>
                <pb n="XII" facs="0013" xml:id="pg_XII"/>
                <p>Research for this volume was completed through special access to restricted
                    documents at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Presidential
                    Materials Project, the Ford Library, the Library of Congress, and other
                    agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has been declassified,
                    some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. Nixon’s papers were
                    transferred to their permanent home at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda,
                    California, after research for this volume was completed. The <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Library staff and Ford Library staff are
                    processing and declassifying many of the documents used in the volume, but they
                    may not be available in their entirety at the time of publication.</p>

                    1969–1976, Volume XXXVIII, Part I</p>
                <p>Much of the documentation included in this volume on the intellectual foundations
                    of U.S. foreign policy was drawn from public sources. Speeches and policy
                    statements were garnered from a number of these sources, the most important of
                    which were the <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United
                        States</hi> and the Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>. A
                    very useful source of information on the intellectual assumptions underlying
                    foreign policy proved to be the background briefings that Kissinger periodically
                    provided to the press. These briefings were not classified, but they were not
                    made public in order to protect the identities of those giving the briefings.
                    The background briefings are located in the Library of Congress, Manuscript
                    Division, Kissinger Papers, Subject File, Boxes CL 425–426.</p>
                <p>Among the classified sources consulted, the most useful were found in the
                    Presidential papers and other White House records maintained by the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Project and the
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> Library. The <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>-era National Security Council
                    Files—specifically the Presidential/HAK MemCons, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> Office Files, and Subject Files—proved particularly
                    helpful in illuminating the President and Kissinger’s world view. Similarly, the
                    Ford-era National Security Adviser Files, notably the Memoranda of Conversations
                    file, provide key documentation of the President’s meetings with his Cabinet,
                    senior foreign policy officials, and world leaders.</p>
                <p>Of the files of the Department of State, the most useful for the purposes of this
                    compilation were the Policy Planning Staff (<gloss target="#t_SP_1">S/P</gloss>)
                    Director’s Files. <persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Winston Lord</persName>’s records
                    contain copies of <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s speeches,
                    memoranda of conversation with members of Congress, and background
                    materials.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper files cited below, a growing number of documents are
                    available on the Internet. The Office of the Historian maintains a list of these
                    Internet resources on its website and encourages readers to consult that site on

                        must at all costs give no quarter whatever to the doves and to tilt his
                        remarks wherever he must tilt them on the side of those who have stood with
                        us rather than trying to pander to those who have always opposed us.</p>
                    <p>2. This means that not only there but in everything that all of our
                        surrogates and other spokesmen do over these next few days and weeks we must
                        emphasize these points:</p>
                    <p>A. This was a peace with honor which achieved the major goals for which the
                        war was waged.</p>
                    <p>B. We were able to get a settlement that under no stretch of the imagination
                        can possibly be described as a coalition government and <pb n="2"
                            facs="0033" xml:id="pg_2"/>one that assures the right of the people of
                        South Vietnam to determine their future without having a Communist
                        government imposed upon them, directly or indirectly.</p>
                    <p>C. The settlement we achieved, rather than being a bug-out which might have
                        ended the war for us, is one that ends the war for the 50 million people of
                        Indochina. This is a fundamental point that has not adequately been brought
                        out except in the line that I wrote into my speech on it at the last
                            moment.<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> was referencing this
                            sentence in his January 23 address: “Now that we have achieved an
                            honorable agreement, let us be proud that America did not settle for a
                            peace that would have betrayed our allies, that would have abandoned our
                            prisoners of war, or that would have ended the war for us but would have
                            continued the war for the 50 million people of Indochina.” (<hi
                                rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                    >Nixon</persName>, 1973</hi>, p. 20) The President reiterated
                            this point during his January 31 news conference, referencing his
                            administration’s accomplishment of achieving peace with honor: “I know
                            it gags some of you to write that phrase, but it is true, and most
                            Americans realize it is true, because it would be peace with dishonor
                            had we—what some have used, the vernacular—‘bugged out’ and allowed what
                            the North Vietnamese wanted: the imposition of a Communist government or
                            a coalition Communist government in the South Vietnamese. That goal they
                            have failed to achieve. Consequently, we can speak of peace with honor
                            and with some pride that it has been achieved.” (Ibid., p. 55)</note>
                        The difference between the Senate and House doves’ position of POWs for
                        withdrawal and the peace we finally got is very simply that the prisoners
                        for withdrawal proposal would have meant that the United States would get
                        out and let the war go ahead. In other words, it would end the war for us
                        and have the war continue for those that remained with 1,000 casualties a
                        week at least ad infinitum. What we have done by sticking in there was to
                        get a peace which ends the war for the long-suffering people of South
                        Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos as well.</p>
                    <p>D. Henry must be prepared to point out how the settlement has been improved
                        from October and also why it was not possible to settle in December. It is
                        obvious that our critics are already beginning to pick up the line with some
                        assist from Hanoi that we could have had the same settlement we eventually
                        achieved in October or in December when the talks broke down. We all know
                        this is totally untrue but the point must be made simply and directly
                        without too much detail.</p>
                    <p>E. Henry must flatly indicate, whenever he gets the opportunity, that the
                        resolutions passed by the House and Senate caucuses over the years we were
                        negotiating and by the full Senate from time to time prolonged the war, and
                        only by the strong action that we took in December were we able to convince
                        the enemy that the enemy should settle and not take the risk of waiting for
                        the Congress to give them even more than they were willing to settle for
                        with us.</p>
                    <p>In essence, the simple points must be made that our opponents in the Congress
                        and in the media wanted to end the war in Vietnam with <pb n="3" facs="0034"
                            xml:id="pg_3"/>dishonor and what amounted really to an abject surrender
                        and defeat for the United States. We persisted in seeing it through until
                        the war was ended with honor. Our opponents would have ended the war in a
                        way that would have led at the very least to a Communist coalition
                        government for South Vietnam or a totally Communist government for South
                        Vietnam. We have ended in a way that assures the people of South Vietnam the
                        right to determine their own future in free, internationally supervised
                        elections, which means that there will be no Communist government unless the
                        people want it and this is something that no one anticipates will really
                        happen. And finally, our opponents with all their talk about peace were only
                        interested in getting peace for America and would have ended our involvement
                        in a way that would have allowed the war to continue indefinitely for the
                        long-suffering people of Indochina. In other words, peace with honor means
                        peace with independence for South Vietnam and peace for the people of
                        Southeast Asia. Peace with surrender and dishonor means peace for us but a
                        Communist government for South Vietnam and continued war for the 50 million
                        people of Indochina.</p>
                    <p>It is imperative that Henry particularly make these points strongly and
                        vigorously when he is before the Congress in his opening statement without
                        going into any detail. I would suggest the opening statement be perhaps no
                        more than 10 minutes and then field questions. He will without question
                        enormously impress the Congress as he has the press with his performance. He
                        must remember that rather than impressing the Congress we want to leave
                        three or four simple, hard messages for them that they can understand and
                        that they, we hope, will go out and peddle to others.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard Nixon</persName> met with

                        a.m. on February 15, 1973. The meeting took place in the Oval Office at the
                        White House. Pool reporters were present for <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName>’s opening remarks on the state of U.S.-European
                        relations:</p>
                    <p>“I have said this is the year of Europe. . . .This is not to say that we are
                        not placing enormous emphasis on completing the settlement in Southeast Asia
                        and on continuing to build our relationship and dialog with the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and the Soviet Union, and our policy in
                        this hemisphere—in Latin America. But the year of Europe becomes very
                            impor<pb n="4" facs="0035" xml:id="pg_4"/>tant in both the economic
                        context, which was brought home by the recent monetary situation, and also
                        in terms of the national security context, because of the fact that <gloss
                            target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>—mutual balanced force reductions—will be
                        a subject on our agenda this year, not only first with our European allies
                        but also with the Soviet Union, and also because of the European Security
                        Conference. It will not be specifically military matters. . . .”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> commented that U.S., European,
                        and Japanese officials planned to devote additional time to discussing
                            <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> and the European Security
                        Conference, predicting that such deliberations would lead to an examination
                        of American global relationships and responsibilities:</p>
                    <p>“We must not overlook the fact that tied into all this are the security
                        arrangements that we have with Europe and Japan. The United States at the
                        present time, after going through Vietnam, will hear, understandably, voices
                        raised, very sincere voices, that ‘After Vietnam, let’s throw up our hands,
                        turn inward, and withdraw from our obligations in the world.’</p>
                    <p>“One of the reasons I considered it vitally important that the war in Vietnam
                        be ended in what I think was the right way, peace with honor, was that it
                        was essential to demonstrate both to our allies in Europe, the Japanese, and
                        other allies, the Thais and so forth, and to potential adversaries, that the
                        United States is a dependable ally. All the power in the world lodged in the
                        United States means nothing unless those who depend upon U.S. power to
                        protect them from the possibilities of aggression from other powers—which
                        they themselves would not be able to do—all the power in the world here
                        means nothing unless there is some assurance, some confidence, some trust
                        that the United States will be credible, will be dependable.” (<hi

                    <p>After the reporters departed at 11:20, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAJ_1">Goodpaster</persName>
                        continued their conversation. In a memorandum for the President’s files
                        prepared by Brigadier General Brent <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1"
                            >Scowcroft</persName>, the President’s Deputy Assistant for National
                        Security Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> further
                        commented on the allied relationship:</p>
                    <p>“The President said that the U.S. always turns the other cheek, but in this
                        case, what had been an alliance of interest and friendship is now just an
                        alliance of interest. Why were we in Vietnam, after all? The issue was not a
                        small strip of land but the credibility and dependability of the United
                        States to its allies and friends. We will not bear grudges, but when an ally
                        is so presumptuous that it attacks us without waiting, for its own political
                        purposes, we will henceforth base our relationship solely on the national
                        interest, not on friendship.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAJ_1">Goodpaster</persName> also discussed the future of
                        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and current proposals related to

                    <p>“The President thought that the principal problem was psychological. We need
                        to work out, he said, what we can do and still preserve confidence in the
                        alliance. General <persName corresp="#p_GAJ_1">Goodpaster</persName> felt we
                        should not be afraid to put out proposals simply for fear that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would not accept them. He mentioned, as
                        examples, ideas for a common ceiling on troop strength and mixed package
                        reductions of elements which were of the most concern to each side. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ_1">Goodpaster</persName> observed that the
                        opening of negotiations by the President with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> had been one
                        of the most constructive developments in the world today, that we must
                        continue to negotiate, and that we should not let the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> play one ally against another. Some
                        force reduction was possible, even though the military were generally
                        opposed.” <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAJ_1">Goodpaster</persName> concluded their meeting at

                    <p>The President then departed for the Pentagon for a meeting with Secretary of
                        Defense <persName corresp="#p_REL_1">Elliot Richardson</persName>, the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff, and <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>.
                        According to a memorandum of conversation, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> commented on the isolationist sentiment permeating
                        American society:</p>
                    <p>“This tendency is fed by the information media. But still, thank God we don’t
                        have government television, putting out just one line.</p>
                    <p>“Other countries have to have the support of the peaceniks to survive. During
                        the recent bombing, the only ones to stand with us were the British, the
                        Germans, and the Turks. All the others took a cheap shot at the bombing.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPE_1">Trudeau</persName>, Tanaka, Schmidt. The
                        bombings in World War II killed millions but that was a ‘good war.’ This is
                        a ‘bad war,’ so the bombing was ‘evil.’ There is a real double standard, and
                        isolationism is rampant.</p>
                    <p>“Clinking glasses with the Chinese and the Soviet leaders wasn’t friendship
                        but mutual interests. We talk to both countries, not to divide them but to
                        seek sound relations with them. We must realize, however, that good
                        relations don’t come simply from knowing other people better.</p>
                    <p>“There is a tendency in the rimland of Asia and elsewhere to tell the U.S. to
                        go home. But Indonesia and <persName corresp="#p_S_1">Suharto</persName>
                        don’t. Should this develop in the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        countries, or should they reduce their forces, the Congress will jump at the
                        chance to cut all <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> forces. We are in
                        danger of not getting enough from Congress, and Europe will encourage these
                        forces which will want us to come home. We would like to be able to put the
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> budget into welfare, but if we did,
                        the world would eventually fall under the Communist system. Despite the
                        setback in South Asia and pressure from Congress, the situation is not
                        hopeless. <pb n="6" facs="0037" xml:id="pg_6"/>That is what the Chinese and
                        Soviet initiatives were all about. Expansion is an article of Communist
                        faith, but so also is caution.</p>
                    <p>“The Korean War was not about Korea, but basically about Japan. The U.S.
                        stand in Korea was a watershed. So it is with Vietnam, although the domino
                        theory is rejected. Vietnam was important not for itself but because of what
                        it demonstrated in terms of support for our friends and allies and in terms
                        of showing our will to our enemies. We had to see it through. I could have
                        ‘bugged out’ free in Vietnam after the ’68 election, but we had to see it
                        through—but not necessarily the way it had been fought up to then. We have
                        made strong moves in such crises as Jordan, Cienfuegos, etc. All these were
                        important in demonstrating our commitments to our friends and our
                        determination to our enemies.</p>
                    <p>“I understand what vilification you, the military, have gone through over
                        Vietnam, but you should remember that the big issue in the war was the
                        American spirit.”</p>
                    <p>The remainder of the conversation focused upon ways in which the military
                        could recognize the returning prisoners of war and ease their reentry into
                        American society. (Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, <persName

                        what to expect as we penetrated twenty years of accumulated isolation,
                        distrust and enmity. Since then we have progressed faster and further than
                        anyone would have predicted, or the rest of the world realizes. <hi

                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">When you took office</hi> there was total lack of
                        diplomatic communication between our two governments, no personal or
                        commercial interchange between our two peoples, mutual public recrimination,
                        and clashing world views.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">In the first two and a half years of your

                        took unilateral public steps in such fields as trade and passports in order
                        to send signals, and pointed our rhetoric toward a new relationship. This
                        resulted in agreement in principle that you would meet the Chinese leaders
                        and my secret exploratory trip of July 1971.</p>

                        joint principles in international affairs, finessed the Taiwan problem
                        through mutual and ambiguous compromise, set in motion bilateral trade and

                        Chinese private positions on international issues. But the Vietnam war
                        continued to inhibit the Chinese, and publicly all we could register was a
                        modest increase in exchanges and trade.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">On this trip in February 1973,</hi> the flood gates opened
                        privately and publicly for the reasons stated. The Chinese leaders are among
                        the very few in the world with a global and longer term perspective—and it
                        now parallels ours in many important respects. In such areas as the Soviet
                        Union, Europe, South Asia and even Japan we have similar outlooks. In
                        others, like Indochina and Korea, we each back our allies but share an
                        interest in independent states and relaxed tensions. And on Taiwan we have
                        reached a clear modus vivendi—on our part, continued, concrete evolution
                        toward full relations with all its implications; and on their part, patience
                        and a pragmatism reflected most vividly in the coming side-by-side presence
                        of a <gloss target="#t_GRC_1">GRC</gloss> Embassy and a <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> Liaison Office. On the bilateral plane, it
                        is full speed ahead on trade and exchanges. As for public relations, the
                        Chinese have long since singled out the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> for attack and have shown increasing cordiality in their
                        public contacts with us.</p>
                    <p>Following are the main points of my talks with the Chinese, topic by
                        topic.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Union</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union dominated our conversations. In 1971 there were somewhat
                        guarded references by the Chinese to Soviet designs, but they
                        ritualistically linked the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as the two superpowers seeking hegemony.
                        By the time of your visit the Chinese leaders were quite candid about the
                        Soviet menace but stayed away from extended discussion. By last June the
                        Soviet Union had become one of the two major topics in my conversations, the
                        other one being Indochina. On this trip it was the centerpiece and
                        completely permeated our talks. The Chinese views generally surfaced in the
                        regional discussion and are detailed later in this report. Following are the
                        more general observations.</p>
                    <p>Chou raised the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in our first meeting
                        and kept coming back to it. He called a special meeting the night of
                        February 17 to discuss this subject and at the end of his presentation he
                        announced my meeting with Mao, where again it was a major topic. We
                        discussed it at length <pb n="9" facs="0040" xml:id="pg_9"/>the next day as
                        well. In literally every region of the world the Chinese see the Soviet hand
                        at play. As you will see in the area discussions below, Mao and Chou urged
                        us to counter the Russians everywhere—to work closely with our allies in
                        Europe and Japan, and to take more positive action to prevent the Soviets
                        filling vacuums or spreading their influence in areas like the Middle East,
                        Persian Gulf, Near East, South Asia and Indian Ocean.</p>
                    <p>In our first meeting, after my opening statement, Chou asked me in effect
                        whether we thought the world was moving toward peace or war. I said that
                        there were some positive developments, but we were not naive about potential
                        dangers, such as the intensive Soviet military buildup. I made clear that we
                        had major business to do with Moscow, but we were under no illusions about
                        its possible motivations. We would continue our policy of keeping the
                        Chinese fully informed and not concluding any agreements that could be
                        directed against Peking.</p>
                    <p>Chou pointed to developments in Europe and said perhaps we sought to “push
                        the ill waters of the Soviet Union eastward.” He also cited our diversion of
                        fighters from Taiwan to South Vietnam last fall in Enhance Plus as an
                        example of our taking advantage of Peking; somewhat out of context, he said
                        that this showed that we might be standing on Chinese shoulders to reach out
                        toward the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The next day I purposely detailed our proposed force reductions on Taiwan and
                        then made a more sweeping analysis of our policy toward the Soviet Union. I
                        said that the nature of our relationship meant that we had to pursue a more
                        complicated policy than the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> which could
                        oppose the Soviet Union outright on issues. We were making several
                        agreements with Moscow, but we would not let these constrain us in the event
                        that our interests were jeopardized. I pointed out that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> could follow one of two courses. If they
                        truly wanted peace, we would welcome that course, and the agreements we were
                        making might contribute to that end. If, however, as seemed more likely,
                        they were bent on a more threatening road, we had shown in the past that we
                        would react strongly if our interests were jeopardized. In any event, I
                        emphasized, we would maintain strong defenses and improve our strategic
                        forces so long as the Soviet buildup continued. And on issues of direct
                        concern to Peking we would take Chinese interests into account, such as on
                        the Soviet initiative on a nuclear understanding, where we have been
                        fighting a delaying action ever since last spring.</p>
                    <p>Chou and then Mao, however, both replayed the theme that we might be helping
                        the Soviet Union, whether or not purposely. Whereas we saw two
                        possibilities, i.e. that the Soviet Union would either pursue a peaceful or
                        a menacing course, the Chinese saw only the latter. They were spreading
                        their influence everywhere with the help of their satel<pb n="10"
                            facs="0041" xml:id="pg_10"/>lites, like India, and were out to isolate
                        the Chinese. The “new czars” were neurotic and omnipresent. It was the
                        Chinese duty to try and expose their designs wherever possible, however
                        lonely their efforts in a world enamored with false détente.</p>
                    <p>Mao even went so far as to suggest that we might like to see the Russians
                        bogged down in an attack on China; after wearing themselves out for a couple
                        of years, we would then “poke a finger” in Moscow’s back. I rejoined that we
                        believe that a war between the two Communist giants was likely to be
                        uncontrollable and have unfortunate consequences for everyone. We therefore
                        wished to prevent such a conflict, not take advantage of it.</p>
                    <p>Given Mao’s and Chou’s skeptical comments on this issue, I treated it at
                        considerable length the day after my meeting with the Chairman. I said there
                        were three hypothetical <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> motives in a
                        policy that contributed to pressures on the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss> from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. First, we
                        might want the Soviet Union to defeat China. I stressed emphatically that
                        whether Moscow defeated China or Europe first, the consequences for us would
                        be the same; we would be isolated and the ultimate target. Thus this could
                        never be our policy.</p>
                    <p>The second possible motive was the one Mao mentioned—our wish for a
                        stalemated Moscow attack on Peking, so as to exhaust the Soviet Union. I
                        pointed out that even partial Soviet dominance of China could have many of
                        the consequences of the first option. In any event, such a major conflict
                        would have unpredictable consequences. The Soviet Union might take rash
                        actions if they were stymied as the Chairman claimed we had been in Vietnam.
                        And we would be forced either to demonstrate our impotence and irrelevance,
                        or make a series of extremely complex decisions.</p>
                    <p>The third possibility was that we might contribute to a war between China and
                        the Soviet Union through misjudgment rather than policy. This I recognized
                        as a danger despite our intentions. I then analyzed at length our policy
                        around the world, with emphasis on Europe, to demonstrate that we plan to
                        maintain our defense, continue a responsible international role, and work
                        closely with our allies. In short, while seeking relaxation with Moscow, we
                        would also ensure that if it did not choose a peaceful course we and our
                        friends would be in a position to resist and defend our national interests.
                        And I made it evident that we would consider aggression against China as
                        involving our own national security.</p>
                    <p>It is not at all clear that we have fully allayed Chinese suspicions. While
                        they have nowhere else to go in the short term, they will certainly watch
                        our Soviet moves with wariness, and take out insurance with Japan and
                        Europe.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problems</p>
                    <p>The current trend therefore is positive, but there are no grounds for
                        complacency. There are at least two areas which have substantial potential
                        for trouble in our relationship:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Our dealings with the Soviet Union.</hi> To date the
                        Soviet factor has been the main leverage in our dealings with the <gloss
                            target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. At the same time—and contrary to the
                        predictions of almost all Soviet experts—our opening to Peking has paid us
                        substantial dividends with Moscow as well. With conscientious attention to
                        both capitals we should be able to continue to have our mao tai and drink
                        our vodka too. Peking, after all, assuming continued hostility with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, has no real alternative to us as
                        a counterweight (despite its recent reaching out to Japan and Western Europe
                        as insurance). And Moscow needs us in such areas as Europe and
                        economics.</p>
                    <p>But this is nevertheless a difficult balancing act that will increasingly
                        face us with hard choices. Mao and Chou both suggested that, inadvertently
                        or not, our Soviet policies could increase the pressures on China. It was
                        even intimated that we might favor a Sino-Soviet conflict, so as to bog down
                        the Soviet Union and weaken it for our own attack. A cutting edge is the
                        Soviet initiative on a nuclear understanding. One of Moscow’s motives is
                        certainly to embarrass us in our relations with Peking, since they know
                        their initiative is anathema to Peking. We have fought a delaying action on
                        this issue for almost a year now, but <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> is apt to push it to a head in conjunction with his

                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">The coming change in Chinese leadership.</hi> Mao is in
                        his 80s and has received an “invitation” from “God.” Chou is 75 and has just
                        publicly noted the need for new leadership soon in his country. They
                        obviously control <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> policy now, but it is
                        not at all clear that they can assure continuity in their policy lines. The
                        Lin Piao affair was obviously a major challenge and may have been a close
                        thing. They have not managed to fill many key party and military posts since
                        then. Mao constantly referred to the difficulties posed by women in China,
                        undoubtedly a reference to his wife who represents the challenge from the
                        left. All of this <pb n="12" facs="0043" xml:id="pg_12"/>is reflected in
                        Chinese eagerness to institutionalize our relationship, even if it means
                        bending the sacred “one China” policy to do it.</p>
                    <p>We know little about power relationships in the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                            >PRC</gloss> and even less about the succession problem. We can only
                        assume—both from the above indices and because of the objective choices
                        facing China—that substantial opposition to present policies exist and that
                        this includes foreign policy. There are undoubtedly those who favor
                        accommodation with Moscow over Washington, for example. Thus, before the
                        present dynasty passes from the scene, we must strengthen bilateral ties,
                        get our two peoples used to a closer relationship, and reach out to more
                        layers of Chinese leadership so as to strengthen the advocates of an opening
                        to America.<note n="8" xml:id="d3fn8">The Department of State’s Bureau of

                        useless to Peking as a counterweight to Moscow if we withdraw from the
                        world, lower our defenses, or play a passive international game. Mao and
                        Chou urged a more aggressive American presence—countering Soviet designs in
                        various areas, keeping close ties with our allies, maintaining our defense
                        posture. If the Chinese became convinced that we were heeding the inward
                        impulses of voluble sectors of Congress, the public and the press, we would
                        undoubtedly witness a sharp turn in Peking’s attitude. You and I have, of
                        course, assured the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> leaders privately,
                        as well as proclaiming publicly, our intentions to maintain a responsible
                        international role. So long as you are President, Peking should certainly be
                        convinced that we will be a crucial factor in the world balance.</p>

                        and patient on this question. Their willingness to ease our predicament is
                        now most dramatically shown in their setting up a liaison office in

                        the Vietnam War is over. Taiwan is a problem we should be able to control,

                    <p>Discussion then moved to the defense budget. There was comment that most
                        people don’t understand that the defense budget has already been cut.
                        Discussion went to the period immediately after World War II when our
                        foreign policy did accomplish great objectives in terms of <gloss

                        budget and helped create the conditions that lead to Korea. The ability to
                        get support for adequate foreign policy and foreign assistance, the
                        President said, is going to be quite a challenge. How do we combat
                        opposition to it? It means a united front for maintaining adequate defense
                        and foreign assistance. We must get across <pb n="14" facs="0045"
                            xml:id="pg_14"/>the point that to have the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> to turn inward would be dangerous. If the <gloss

                        initiatives will go down the drain. The day the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> ceases to be a formidable defense and diplomatic power,
                        economics will not be enough to hold it together. It is a dangerous
                        situation, the President said. The old isolationists and the new
                        isolationists could be a majority. Our failure to succeed could lead to a
                        period when we could draw away from our responsibility. We must inform the
                        country that having ended the war and with our new initiatives in China and
                        the Soviet Union, this is the time for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> to continue to play a forceful role in the world—militarily,
                        economically and diplomatically. The President recalled when he left
                        Washington in 1960, we had an 8 to 1 defense advantage. Today we are behind
                        in throw weight.</p>
                    <p>With the Vietnam war over, we must inspire the American spirit and accept the
                        role of world leadership. The game is more difficult to play today than
                        before. If the Soviet Union and the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                        continue fighting with one another, that adds to the complexities. Let’s not
                        let the impression get around that now that we have gotten out of Vietnam,
                        let’s get out of the world. The President then expressed his appreciation to
                        all of those present.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> said that he had spent two

                        all the shots; we can’t dominate; but, we can’t let the world be shaped in a
                        way that would be counter to our interests.”</p>
                    <p>If we can get people in this country proud of their world role and the record
                        in Vietnam, then there is much to be accomplished. But if you tell them that
                        it was all in vain, we will never get them to try again. “This country needs
                        a sense of direction; this country needs a sense of pride; this country
                        needs a positive attitude,” the President said.</p>

                            for international monetary reform in his January 31 economic report to
                            Congress: “Nowhere is the need to make 1973 a year of economic reform

                            subsequently provided a framework for further cooperation and engagement
                            between the United States and other global powers in the world trading

                    </p>
                    <p>The Nation is again at peace. We also are firmly on the course of strong
                        economic growth at home. Now we must turn more of our attention to the
                        urgent problems we face in our economic dealings with other nations.
                        International problems may seem to some of us to be far away, but they have
                        a very direct impact on the jobs, the incomes and the living standards of
                        our people. Neither the peace we have achieved nor the economic growth
                        essential to our national welfare will last if we leave such matters
                        unattended, for they can diminish our prosperity at home and at the same
                        time provoke harmful friction abroad.</p>
                    <p>Our major difficulties stem from relying too long upon outdated economic
                        arrangements and institutions despite the rapid changes which have taken
                        place in the world. Many countries we helped to rebuild after World War II
                        are now our strong economic competitors. Americans can no longer act as if
                        these historic developments had not taken place. We must do a better job of
                        preparing ourselves—both in the private sector and in the Government—to
                        compete more effectively in world markets, so that expanding trade can bring
                        greater benefits to our people.</p>
                    <p>In the summer of 1971, this Administration initiated fundamental changes in
                        American foreign economic policy.<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2">A reference to
                            the administration’s August 1971 New Economic Policy, which removed the

                        We have also introduced proposals for the reform of the international
                        monetary and trading systems which have lost their ability to deal with
                        current problems. The turmoil in world monetary affairs has demonstrated
                        clearly that greater urgency must now be attached to constructive
                        reform.</p>

                    <p>At home, we have continued our fight to maintain price stability and to
                        improve our productivity—objectives which are as important to our
                        international economic position as to our domestic welfare.</p>
                    <p>What is our next step?</p>
                    <p>In my State of the Union message on the economy last month, I outlined
                        certain measures to strengthen both our domestic and international economic
                        position. One of the most important is trade reform.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d5fn3">Breaking with tradition, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> delivered six shorter State of the Union messages
                            to Congress during February and March 1973: an overview and five
                            messages focusing upon natural resources and the environment, human
                            resources, community development, law enforcement and drug abuse
                            prevention, and the economy. While primarily domestic in theme and
                            scope, the economic message contained several references to improving
                            American relationships with its global trading partners. See <hi

                    </p>
                    <p>In choosing an international trade policy which will benefit all Americans, I
                        have concluded that we must face up to more intense long-term competition in
                        the world’s markets rather than shrink from it. Those who would have us turn
                        inward, hiding behind a shield of import restrictions of indefinite
                        duration, might achieve short-term gains and benefit certain groups, but
                        they would exact a high cost from the economy as a whole. Those costs would
                        be borne by all of us in the form of higher prices and lower real income.
                        Only in response to unfair competition, or the closing of markets abroad to
                        our goods, or to provide time for adjustment, would such restrictive
                        measures be called for.</p>
                    <p>My approach is based both on my strong faith in the ability of Americans to
                        compete, and on my confidence that all nations will recognize their own
                        vital interest in lowering economic barriers and applying fairer and more
                        effective trading rules.</p>
                    <p>The fact that most of these comments are addressed to the role of our
                        Government should not divert attention from the vital role which private
                        economic activity will play in resolving our current problems. The
                        cooperation and the initiative of all sectors of our economy are needed to
                        increase our productivity and to keep our prices competitive. This is
                        essential to our international trading position. Yet there are certain
                        necessary steps which only the Government can take, given the worldwide
                        scope of trading activity and the need for broad international agreement to
                        expand trade fairly and effectively. I am determined that we shall take
                        those steps.</p>
                    <p>I know that the American people and their representatives in the Congress can
                        be counted on to rise to the challenge of the changing world economy.
                        Together we must do what is needed to further the prosperity of our country,
                        and of the world in which we live.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Good evening:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Four years and two months ago, when I first came into this office as
                        President, by far the most difficult problem confronting the Nation was the
                        seemingly endless war in Vietnam. Five hundred and fifty thousand Americans
                        were in Vietnam. As many as 300 a week were being killed in action. Hundreds
                        were held as prisoners of war in North Vietnam. No progress was being made
                        at the peace negotiations.</p>
                    <p>I immediately initiated a program to end the war and win an honorable
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>Eleven times over the past 4 years I have reported to the Nation from this
                        room on the progress we have made toward that goal. Tonight, the day we have
                        all worked and prayed for has finally come.</p>
                    <p>For the first time in 12 years, no American military forces are in Vietnam.
                        All of our American <gloss target="#t_POW_1">POW</gloss>’s are on their way
                        home. The 17 million people of South Vietnam have the right to choose their
                        own government without outside interference, and because of our program of
                        Vietnamization, they have the strength to defend that right. We have
                        prevented the imposition of a Communist government by force on South
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>There are still some problem areas. The provisions of the agreement requiring
                        an accounting for all missing in action in Indochina, the provisions with
                        regard to Laos and Cambodia, the provisions prohibiting infiltration from
                        North Vietnam into South Vietnam have not been complied with. We have and
                        will continue to comply with the agreement. We shall insist that North
                        Vietnam comply with the agreement. And the leaders of North Vietnam should
                        have no doubt as to the consequences if they fail to comply with the
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>But despite these difficulties, we can be proud tonight of the fact that we
                        have achieved our goal of obtaining an agreement which provides peace with
                        honor in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>On this day, let us honor those who made this achievement possible: those who
                        sacrificed their lives, those who were disabled, those who made every one of
                        us proud to be an American as they returned from years of Communist
                        imprisonment, and every one of the 2½ million Americans who served honorably
                        in our Nation’s longest war. <pb n="18" facs="0049" xml:id="pg_18"/>Never
                        have men served with greater devotion abroad with less apparent support at
                        home.</p>
                    <p>Let us provide these men with the veterans benefits and the job opportunities
                        they have earned. Let us honor them with the respect they deserve. And I say
                        again tonight, let us not dishonor those who served their country by
                        granting amnesty to those who deserted America.</p>
                    <p>Tonight I want to express the appreciation of the Nation to others who helped
                        make this day possible. I refer to you, the great majority of Americans
                        listening to me tonight, who, despite an unprecedented barrage of criticism
                        from a small but vocal minority, stood firm for peace with honor. I know it
                        was not easy for you to do so.</p>
                    <p>We have been through some difficult times together. I recall the time in
                        November 1969 when hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched on the
                        White House, the time in April 1970 when I found it necessary to order
                        attacks on Communist bases in Cambodia, the time in May 1972 when I ordered
                        the mining of Haiphong and airstrikes on military targets in North Vietnam
                        in order to stop a massive Communist offensive in South Vietnam, and
                        then—and this was perhaps the hardest decision I have made as President—on
                        December 18, 1972, when our hopes for peace were so high and when the North
                        Vietnamese stonewalled us at the conference table, I found it necessary to
                        order more airstrikes on military targets in North Vietnam in order to break
                        the deadlock.</p>
                    <p>On each of these occasions, the voices of opposition we heard in Washington
                        were so loud they at times seemed to be the majority. But across America,
                        the overwhelming majority stood firm against those who advocated peace at
                        any price—even if the price would have been defeat and humiliation for the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>Because you stood firm—stood firm for doing what was right—[Air Force Lt.]

                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of domestic budgetary issues.]</p>
                    <p>As we end America’s longest war, let us resolve that we shall not lose the
                        peace. During the past year we have made great progress toward our goal of a
                        generation of peace for America and the world. The war in Vietnam has been
                        ended. After 20 years of hostility and confrontation, we have opened a
                        constructive new relationship with the People’s Republic of China where
                        one-fourth of all the people in the world live. We negotiated last year with
                        the Soviet Union a number of <pb n="19" facs="0050" xml:id="pg_19"
                        />important agreements, including an agreement which takes a major step in
                        limiting nuclear arms.</p>
                    <p>Now there are some who say that in view of all this progress toward peace,
                        why not cut our defense budget?</p>
                    <p>Well, let’s look at the facts. Our defense budget today takes the lowest
                        percentage of our gross national product that it has in 20 years. There is
                        nothing I would like better than to be able to reduce it further. But we
                        must never forget that we would not have made the progress toward lasting
                        peace that we have made in this past year unless we had had the military
                        strength that commanded respect.</p>
                    <p>This year we have begun new negotiations with the Soviet Union for further
                        limitations on nuclear arms. And we shall be participating later in the year
                        in negotiations for mutual reduction of forces in Europe.</p>
                    <p>If prior to these negotiations we in the United States unilaterally reduce
                        our defense budget, or reduce our forces in Europe, any chance for
                        successful negotiations for mutual reduction of forces or limitation of arms
                        will be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>There is one unbreakable rule of international diplomacy. You can’t get
                        something in a negotiation unless you have something to give. If we cut our
                        defenses before negotiations begin, any incentive for other nations to cut
                        theirs will go right out the window.</p>
                    <p>If the United States reduces its defenses and others do not, it will increase
                        the danger of war. It is only a mutual reduction of forces which will reduce
                        the danger of war. And that is why we must maintain our strength until we
                        get agreements under which other nations will join us in reducing the burden
                        of armaments.</p>
                    <p>What is at stake is whether the United States shall become the second
                        strongest nation in the world. If that day ever comes, the chance for
                        building a new structure of peace in the world would be irreparably damaged,
                        and free nations everywhere would be living in mortal danger.</p>
                    <p>A strong United States is not a threat to peace. It is the free world’s
                        indispensable guardian of peace and freedom.</p>
                    <p>I ask for your support tonight, for keeping the strength—the strength which
                        enabled us to make such great progress toward world peace in the past year
                        and which is indispensable as we continue our bold new initiatives for peace
                        in the years ahead.</p>
                    <p>As we consider some of our problems tonight, let us never forget how
                        fortunate we are to live in America at this time in our history. We have
                        ended the longest and most difficult war in our history in a way that
                        maintains the trust of our allies and the respect of our adversaries. We are
                        the strongest and most prosperous nation in the world. Because <pb n="20"
                            facs="0051" xml:id="pg_20"/>of our strength, America has the magnificent
                        opportunity to play the leading role of bringing down the walls of hostility
                        which divide the people of the world, in reducing the burden of armaments in
                        the world, of building a structure of lasting peace in the world. And
                        because of our wealth, we have the means to move forward at home on exciting
                        new programs—programs for progress which will provide better environment,
                        education, housing, and health care for all Americans and which will enable
                        us to be more generous to the poor, the elderly, the disabled, and the
                        disadvantaged than any nation in the history of the world.</p>
                    <p>These are goals worthy of a great people. Let us, therefore, put aside those
                        honest differences about war which have divided us and dedicate ourselves to
                        meet the great challenges of peace which can unite us. As we do, let us not
                        overlook a third element, an element more important even than military might
                        or economic power, because it is essential for greatness in a nation.</p>
                    <p>The pages of history are strewn with the wreckage of nations which fell by
                        the wayside at the height of their strength and wealth because their people
                        became weak, soft, and self-indulgent and lost the character and the spirit
                        which had led to their greatness.</p>
                    <p>As I speak to you tonight, I am confident that will not happen to America.
                        And my confidence has been increased by the fact that a war which cost
                        America so much in lives and money and division at home has, as it ended,
                        provided an opportunity for millions of Americans to see again the character
                        and the spirit which made America a great nation.</p>
                    <p>A few days ago in this room, I talked to a man who had spent almost 8 years
                        in a Communist prison camp in North Vietnam.<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">The
                            President was referring to Col. Robinson Risner, <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss>, with whom he met on March 12, 1973.
                            On the same day, the President also met with former prisoner of war
                            Capt. Jeremiah A. Denton, Jr., <gloss target="#t_USN_1">USN</gloss>.
                            [Footnote is in the original.]</note> For over 4 years he was in
                        solitary confinement. In that 4-year period he never saw and never talked to
                        another human being except his Communist captors. He lived on two meals a
                        day, usually just a piece of bread, a bowl of soup. All he was given to read
                        was Communist propaganda. All he could listen to was the Communist
                        propaganda on radio.</p>
                    <p>I asked him how he was able to survive it and come home, standing tall and
                        proud, saluting the American flag. He paused a long time before he answered.
                        And then he said, “It is difficult for me to answer. I am not very good at
                        words. All I can say is that it was faith—faith in God and faith in my
                        country.”</p>
                    <pb n="21" facs="0052" xml:id="pg_21"/>
                    <p>If men who suffered so much for America can have such faith, let us who have
                        received so much from America renew our faith—our faith in God, our faith in
                        our country, and our faith in ourselves.</p>
                    <p>If we meet the great challenges of peace that lie ahead with this kind of
                        faith, then one day it will be written: This was America’s finest hour.</p>

                        will be initiating new negotiations and developing new relationships which
                        could determine the political-economic structure of the world for the

                        the dramatic changes of the past year, changes due in substantial measure to
                        innovations we began to introduce into American foreign policy four years
                        ago.</p>
                    <p>We can take special pride in the four accomplishments of last year that are
                        enabling us to complete the transition from the concerns of the past to the

                        Administration’s foreign policy objectives. I have elaborated here upon
                        those which collectively give 1973 the characteristic of a year of
                        building—the building of relations and institutions that could determine the
                        course of the rest of the century. Given the President’s strong interest and
                        leadership in this effort, we have every reason to expect that further
                        substantial progress toward lasting peace and cooperation will be made in
                        the coming year.</p>
                    <p>It is now commonplace to hear that there are no more dramatic accomplishments
                        possible in foreign affairs. I do not agree. 1973 can be a dramatic year—not
                        in breaking old patterns but in building new ones, a year when we begin to
                        erect the framework for a generation of peace.</p>
                    <p>But 1973 will be just beginning. The road ahead will be as difficult and
                        dangerous as it will be promising. It will require the continued
                        perseverance and engagement of this great nation. That is why our foreign
                        policy must continue to be a policy of engagement—engagement with
                        adversaries in building cooperation, engagement with allies on a basis of
                        shared values and interests, engagement with developing nations in the
                        effort to raise the living standards of their people.</p>
                    <p>For many years the economic and political health of the world has been
                        heavily affected by the state of the American society. Now our condition
                        increasingly is affected by the welfare of others. The degree of
                        interdependence among nations and many of the principal trends of
                        international affairs are succinctly evident in the statistical indicators
                        of the state of the world I have appended to this introduction.<note n="7"

                        policy which would overcome the deep and destructive divisions within this
                        country and restore a sense of common purpose in America’s approach to world
                        affairs. Today the obstacles to such a common purpose have been overcome,
                        and we have found a new self-confidence, devoid both of arrogance and of
                        destructive self-doubts. The foreign policy objectives we are setting forth
                        are moderate and constructive ones. It will be my earnest endeavor so to
                        carry them out that the Administration and the Congress, the leadership of

                    <p rend="center">The Year of Europe</p>
                    <p>This year has been called the year of Europe, but not because Europe was less
                        important in 1972 or in 1969. The alliance between the United States and
                        Europe has been the cornerstone of all postwar foreign policy. It provided
                        the political framework for American engagements in Europe and marked the
                        definitive end of U.S. isolationism. It insured the sense of security that
                        allowed Europe to recover from the devastation of the war. It reconciled
                        former enemies. It was the stimulus for an unprecedented endeavor in
                        European unity and the principal means to forge the common policies that
                        safeguarded Western security in an era of prolonged tension and
                        confrontation. Our values, our goals, and our basic interests are most
                        closely identified with those of Europe.</p>
                    <p>Nineteen seventy-three is the year of Europe because the era that was shaped
                        by decisions of a generation ago is ending.<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">In a

                            commented on this transition: “The way the Europeans are talking today,
                            European unity will not be in our interest, certainly not from a
                            political viewpoint or from an economic viewpoint. When we used to talk
                            about European unity, we were thinking in terms of the men who would be
                            at the top of Europe who would be in control. Those men were people that
                            we could get along with. Today, however, when we talk of European unity,
                            and when we look far ahead, we have to recognize the stark fact that a
                            united Europe will be led primarily by Left-leaning or Socialist heads
                            of government.” (National Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"

                        success of those policies has produced new realities that require new
                        approaches:</p>
                    <pb n="25" facs="0056" xml:id="pg_25"/>
                    <p>—The revival of western Europe is an established fact, as is the historic
                        success of its movement toward economic unification.</p>
                    <p>—The East-West strategic military balance has shifted from American
                        preponderance to near-equality, bringing with it the necessity for a new
                        understanding of the requirements of our common security.</p>
                    <p>—Other areas of the world have grown in importance. Japan has emerged as a
                        major power center. In many fields, “Atlantic” solutions to be viable must
                        include Japan.</p>
                    <p>—We are in a period of relaxation of tensions. But as the rigid divisions of
                        the past two decades diminish, new assertions of national identity and
                        national rivalry emerge.</p>
                    <p>—Problems have arisen, unforeseen a generation ago, which require new types
                        of cooperative action. Insuring the supply of energy for industrialized
                        nations is an example.</p>
                    <p>These factors have produced a dramatic transformation of the psychological
                        climate in the West—a change which is the most profound current challenge to
                        Western statesmanship. In Europe, a new generation to whom war and its
                        dislocations are not personal experiences takes stability for granted. But
                        it is less committed to the unity that made peace possible and to the effort
                        required to maintain it. In the United States, decades of global burdens
                        have fostered, and the frustrations of the war in Southeast Asia have
                        accentuated, a reluctance to sustain global involvements on the basis of
                        preponderant American responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Inevitably this period of transition will have its strains. There have been
                        complaints in America that Europe ignores its wider responsibilities in
                        pursuing economic self-interest too one-sidedly and that Europe is not
                        carrying its fair share of the burden of the common defense. There have been
                        complaints in Europe that America is out to divide Europe economically, or
                        to desert Europe militarily, or to bypass Europe diplomatically. Europeans
                        appeal to the United States to accept their independence and their
                        occasionally severe criticism of us in the name of Atlantic unity, while at
                        the same time they ask for a veto on our independent policies—also in the
                        name of Atlantic unity.</p>
                    <p>Our challenge is whether a unity forged by a common perception of danger can
                        draw new purpose from shared positive aspirations.</p>
                    <p>If we permit the Atlantic partnership to atrophy, or to erode through
                        neglect, carelessness, or mistrust, we risk what has been achieved and we
                        shall miss our historic opportunity for even greater achievement.</p>
                    <p>In the forties and fifties the task was economic reconstruction and security
                        against the danger of attack; the West responded with courage and
                        imagination. Today the need is to make the Atlantic relationship as <pb
                            n="26" facs="0057" xml:id="pg_26"/>dynamic a force in building a new
                        structure of peace, less geared to crisis and more conscious of
                        opportunities, drawing its inspirations from its goals rather than its
                        fears. The Atlantic nations must join in a fresh act of creation equal to
                        that undertaken by the postwar generation of leaders of Europe and
                        America.</p>
                    <p>This is why the President is embarking on a personal and direct approach to
                        the leaders of western Europe. In his discussions with the heads of
                        government of Britain, Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany, and France,
                        the Secretary General of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, and other
                        European leaders, it is the President’s purpose to lay the basis for a new
                        era of creativity in the West.</p>
                    <p>His approach will be to deal with Atlantic problems comprehensively. The
                        political, military, and economic issues in Atlantic relations are linked by
                        reality, not by our choice nor for the tactical purpose of trading one off
                        against the other. The solutions will not be worthy of the opportunity if
                        left to technicians. They must be addressed at the highest level.</p>
                    <p>In 1972 the President transformed relations with our adversaries to lighten
                        the burdens of fear and suspicion.</p>
                    <p>In 1973 we can gain the same sense of historical achievement by
                        reinvigorating shared ideals and common purposes with our friends.</p>
                    <p>The United States proposes to its Atlantic partners that by the time the
                        President travels to Europe toward the end of the year we will have worked
                        out a new Atlantic charter setting the goals for the future, a blueprint
                        that:</p>
                    <p>—Builds on the past without becoming its prisoner.</p>
                    <p>—Deals with the problems our success has created.</p>
                    <p>—Creates for the Atlantic nations a new relationship in whose progress Japan
                        can share.</p>
                    <p>We ask our friends in Europe, Canada, and ultimately Japan to join us in this
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>This is what we mean by the year of Europe.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problems in Atlantic Relationships</p>
                    <p>The problems in Atlantic relationships are real. They have arisen in part
                        because during the fifties and sixties the Atlantic community organized
                        itself in different ways in the many different dimensions of its common
                        enterprise.</p>
                    <p>—In economic relations the European Community has increasingly stressed its
                        regional personality; the United States at the same time must act as part
                        of, and be responsible for, a wider international trade and monetary system.
                        We must reconcile these two perspectives.</p>
                    <pb n="27" facs="0058" xml:id="pg_27"/>
                    <p>—In our collective defense we are still organized on the principle of unity
                        and integration, but in radically different strategic conditions. The full
                        implications of this change have yet to be faced.</p>
                    <p>—Diplomacy is the subject of frequent consultations but is essentially being
                        conducted by traditional nation-states. The United States has global
                        interests and responsibilities. Our European allies have regional interests.
                        These are not necessarily in conflict, but in the new era neither are they
                        automatically identical.</p>
                    <p>In short, we deal with each other regionally and even competitively on an
                        integrated basis in defense, and as nation-states in diplomacy. When the
                        various collective institutions were rudimentary, the potential
                        inconsistency in their modes of operation was not a problem. But after a
                        generation of evolution and with the new weight and strength of our allies,
                        the various parts of the construction are not always in harmony and
                        sometimes obstruct each other.</p>
                    <p>If we want to foster unity we can no longer ignore these problems. The
                        Atlantic nations must find a solution for the management of their diversity
                        to serve the common objectives which underlie their unity. We can no longer
                        afford to pursue national or regional self-interest without a unifying
                        framework. We cannot hold together if each country or region asserts its
                        autonomy whenever it is to its benefit and invokes unity to curtail the
                        independence of others.</p>
                    <p>We must strike a new balance between self-interest and the common interest.
                        We must identify interests and positive values beyond security in order to
                        engage once again the commitment of peoples and parliaments. We need a
                        shared view of the world we seek to build.</p>

                    <p>No element of American postwar policy has been more consistent than our
                        support of European unity. We encouraged it at every turn. We knew that a
                        united Europe would be a more independent partner. But we assumed, perhaps
                        too uncritically, that our common interests would be assured by our long
                        history of cooperation. We expected that political unity would follow
                        economic integration and that a unified Europe working cooperatively with us
                        in an Atlantic partnership would ease many of our international burdens.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that many of these expectations are not being fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>We and Europe have benefited from European economic integration. Increased
                        trade within Europe has stimulated the growth of European economies and the
                        expansion of trade in both directions across the Atlantic.</p>
                    <pb n="28" facs="0059" xml:id="pg_28"/>
                    <p>But we cannot ignore the fact that Europe’s economic success and its
                        transformation from a recipient of our aid to a strong competitor has
                        produced a certain amount of friction. There have been turbulence and a
                        sense of rivalry in international monetary relations.</p>
                    <p>In trade, the natural economic weight of a market of 250 million people has
                        pressed other states to seek special arrangements to protect their access to
                        it. The prospect of a closed trading system embracing the European Community
                        and a growing number of other nations in Europe, the Mediterranean, and
                        Africa appears to be at the expense of the United States and other nations
                        which are excluded. In agriculture, where the United States has a
                        comparative advantage, we are particularly concerned that Community
                        protective policies may restrict access for our products.</p>
                    <p>This divergence comes at a time when we are experiencing a chronic and
                        growing deficit in our balance of payments and protectionist pressures of
                        our own. Europeans in turn question our investment policies and doubt our
                        continued commitment to their economic unity.</p>
                    <p>The gradual accumulation of sometimes petty, sometimes major, economic
                        disputes must be ended and be replaced by a determined commitment on both
                        sides of the Atlantic to find cooperative solutions.</p>
                    <p>The United States will continue to support the unification of Europe. We have
                        no intention of destroying what we worked so hard to help build. For us,
                        European unity is what it has always been: not an end in itself but a means
                        to the strengthening of the West. We shall continue to support European
                        unity as a component of a larger Atlantic partnership.</p>
                    <p>This year we begin comprehensive trade negotiations with Europe as well as
                        with Japan. We shall also continue to press the effort to reform the
                        monetary system so that it promotes stability rather than constant
                        disruptions. A new equilibrium must be achieved in trade and monetary
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>We see these negotiations as a historic opportunity for positive achievement.
                        They must engage the top political leaders, for they require above all a
                        commitment of political will. If they are left solely to the experts the
                        inevitable competitiveness of economic interests will dominate the debate.
                        The influence of pressure groups and special interests will become
                        pervasive. There will be no overriding sense of direction. There will be no
                        framework for the generous solutions or mutual concessions essential to
                        preserve a vital Atlantic partnership.</p>
                    <p>It is the responsibility of national leaders to insure that economic
                        negotiations serve larger political purposes. They must recognize that
                        economic rivalry, if carried on without restraint, will in the end damage
                        other relationships.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Atlantic unity has always come most naturally in the field of defense. For
                        many years the military threats to Europe were unambiguous, the requirements
                        to meet them were generally agreed on both sides of the Atlantic, and
                        America’s responsibility was preeminent and obvious. Today we remain united
                        on the objective of collective defense, but we face the new challenge of
                        maintaining it under radically changed strategic conditions and with the new
                        opportunity of enhancing our security through negotiated reductions of
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>The West no longer holds the nuclear predominance that permitted it in the
                        fifties and sixties to rely almost solely on a strategy of massive nuclear
                        retaliation. Because under conditions of nuclear parity such a strategy
                        invites mutual suicide, the alliance must have other choices. The collective
                        ability to resist attack in western Europe by means of flexible responses
                        has become central to a rational strategy and crucial to the maintenance of
                        peace. For this reason, the United States has maintained substantial
                        conventional forces in Europe and our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        allies have embarked on a significant effort to modernize and improve their
                        own military establishments.</p>
                    <p>While the Atlantic alliance is committed to a strategy of flexible response
                        in principle, the requirements of flexibility are complex and expensive.
                        Flexibility by its nature requires sensitivity to new conditions and
                        continual consultation among the allies to respond to changing
                        circumstances. And we must give substance to the defense posture that our
                        strategy defines. Flexible response cannot be simply a slogan wrapped around
                        the defense structure that emerges from lowest-common-denominator
                        compromises driven by domestic considerations. It must be seen by ourselves
                        and by potential adversaries as a credible, substantial, and rational
                        posture of defense.</p>
                    <p>A great deal remains to be accomplished to give reality to the goal of
                        flexible response:</p>
                    <pb n="30" facs="0061" xml:id="pg_30"/>
                    <p>—There are deficiencies in important areas of our conventional defense.</p>
                    <p>—There are still unresolved issues in our doctrine; for example, on the
                        crucial question of the role of tactical nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>—There are anomalies in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> deployments as
                        well as in its logistics structure.</p>
                    <p>To maintain the military balance that has insured stability in Europe for 25
                        years, the alliance has no choice but to address these needs and to reach an
                        agreement on our defense requirements. This task is all the more difficult
                        because the lessening of tensions has given new impetus to arguments that it
                        is safe to begin reducing forces unilaterally. And unbridled economic
                        competition can sap the impulse for common defense. All governments of the
                        Western alliance face a major challenge in educating their peoples to the
                        realities of security in the 1970’s.</p>
                    <p>The President has asked me to state that America remains committed to doing
                        its fair share in Atlantic defense. He is adamantly opposed to unilateral
                        withdrawals of U.S. forces from Europe. But we owe to our peoples a rational
                        defense posture, at the safest minimum size and cost, with burdens equitably
                        shared. This is what the President believes must result from the dialogue
                        with our allies in 1973.</p>
                    <p>When this is achieved, the necessary American forces will be maintained in
                        Europe, not simply as a hostage to trigger our nuclear weapons but as an
                        essential contribution to an agreed and intelligible structure of Western
                        defense. This, too, will enable us to engage our adversaries intelligently
                        in negotiations for mutual balanced reductions.</p>
                    <p>In the next few weeks the United States will present to <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> the product of our own preparations for
                        the negotiations on mutual balanced force reductions which will begin this
                            year.<note n="5" xml:id="d8fn5">The negotiations formally began in
                            Vienna on October 30.</note> We hope that it will be a contribution to a
                        broader dialogue on security. Our approach is designed not from the point of
                        view of special American interests, but of general alliance interests. Our
                        position will reflect the President’s view that these negotiations are not a
                        subterfuge to withdraw U.S. forces regardless of consequences. No formula
                        for reductions is defensible, whatever its domestic appeal or political
                        rationale, if it undermines security.</p>
                    <p>Our objective in the dialogue on defense is a new consensus on security,
                        addressed to new conditions and to the hopeful new possibilities of
                        effective arms limitations.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>We have entered a truly remarkable period of East-West diplomacy. The last
                        two years have produced an agreement on Berlin, a treaty between West
                        Germany and the U.S.S.R., a strategic arms limitation agreement, the
                        beginning of negotiations on a European Security Conference and on mutual
                        balanced force reductions, and a series of significant practical bilateral
                        agreements between Western and Eastern countries, including a dramatic
                        change in bilateral relations between the United States and the U.S.S.R.
                        These were not isolated actions, but steps on a course charted in 1969 and
                        carried forward as a collective effort. Our approach to détente stressed
                        that negotiations had to be concrete, not atmospheric, and that concessions
                        should be reciprocal. We expect to carry forward the policy of relaxation of
                        tensions on this basis.</p>
                    <p>Yet this very success has created its own problems. There is an increasing
                        uneasiness—all the more insidious for rarely being made explicit—that
                        superpower diplomacy might sacrifice the interests of traditional allies and
                        other friends. Where our allies’ interests have been affected by our
                        bilateral negotiations, as in the talks on the limitation of strategic arms,
                        we have been scrupulous in consulting them; where our allies are directly
                        involved, as in the negotiations on mutual balanced force reductions, our
                        approach is to proceed jointly on the basis of agreed positions. Yet some of
                        our friends in Europe have seemed unwilling to accord America the same trust
                        in our motives as they received from us or to grant us the same tactical
                        flexibility that they employed in pursuit of their own policies. The United
                        States is now often taken to task for flexibility where we used to be
                        criticized for rigidity.</p>
                    <p>All of this underlines the necessity to articulate a clear set of common
                        objectives together with our allies. Once that is accomplished, it will be
                        quite feasible, indeed desirable, for the several allies to pursue these
                        goals with considerable tactical flexibility. If we agree on common
                        objectives it will become a technical question whether a particular measure
                        is pursued in a particular forum or whether to proceed bilaterally or
                        multilaterally. Then those allies who seek reassurances of America’s
                        commitment will find it not in verbal reaffirmations of loyalty, but in an
                        agreed framework of purpose.</p>
                    <p>We do not need to agree on all policies. In many areas of the world our
                        approaches will differ, especially outside of Europe. But we do require an
                        understanding of what should be done jointly and of the limits we should
                        impose on the scope of our autonomy.</p>
                    <p>We have no intention of buying an illusory tranquillity at the expense of our
                        friends. The United States will never knowingly sacrifice the interests of
                        others. But the perception of common interests is not automatic; it requires
                        constant redefinition. The relaxation of tensions to which we are committed
                        makes allied cohesion indispensable yet more <pb n="32" facs="0063"
                            xml:id="pg_32"/>difficult. We must insure that the momentum of détente
                        is maintained by common objectives rather than by drift, escapism, or
                        complacency.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">America’s Contribution</p>
                    <p>The agenda I have outlined here is not an American prescription, but an
                        appeal for a joint effort of creativity. The historic opportunity for this
                        generation is to build a new structure of international relations for the
                        decades ahead. A revitalized Atlantic partnership is indispensable for it.
                        The United States is prepared to make its contribution:</p>
                    <p>—We will continue to support European unity. Based on the principles of
                        partnership, we will make concessions to its further growth. We will expect
                        to be met in a spirit of reciprocity.</p>
                    <p>—We will not disengage from our solemn commitments to our allies. We will
                        maintain our forces and not withdraw from Europe unilaterally. In turn, we
                        expect from each ally a fair share of the common effort for the common
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>—We shall continue to pursue the relaxation of tensions with our adversaries
                        on the basis of concrete negotiations in the common interest. We welcome the
                        participation of our friends in a constructive East-West dialogue.</p>
                    <p>—We will never consciously injure the interests of our friends in Europe or
                        in Asia. We expect in return that their policies will take seriously our
                        interests and our responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>—We are prepared to work cooperatively on new common problems we face.
                        Energy, for example, raises the challenging issues of assurance of supply,
                        impact of oil revenues on international currency stability, the nature of
                        common political and strategic interests, and long-range relations of
                        oil-consuming to oil-producing countries. This could be an area of
                        competition; it should be an area of collaboration.</p>
                    <p>—Just as Europe’s autonomy is not an end in itself, so the Atlantic community
                        cannot be an exclusive club. Japan must be a principal partner in our common
                        enterprise.</p>
                    <p>We hope that our friends in Europe will meet us in this spirit. We have
                        before us the example of the great accomplishments of the past decades and
                        the opportunity to match and dwarf them. This is the task ahead. This is
                        how, in the 1970’s, the Atlantic nations can truly serve our peoples and the
                        cause of peace.</p>

                    <p rend="center">INTRODUCTION</p>
                    <p>In January 1969, America needed to change the philosophy and practice of its
                        foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>Whoever took office four years ago would have faced this challenge. After a
                        generation, the postwar world had been transformed and demanded a fresh
                        approach. It was not a question of our previous policies having failed;
                        indeed, in many areas they had been very successful. It was rather that new
                        conditions, many of them achievements of our policies, summoned new
                        perspectives.</p>
                    <p rend="center">The World We Found</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The international environment was dominated by seemingly
                            intractable confrontation between the two major nuclear powers.</hi>
                        Throughout the nuclear age both the fears of war and hopes for peace
                        revolved around our relations with the Soviet Union. Our growing nuclear
                        arsenals were largely directed at each other. We alone had the capacity to
                        wreak catastrophic damage across the planet. Our ideologies clashed. We both
                        had global interests, and this produced many friction points. We each led
                        and dominated a coalition of opposing states.</p>
                    <p>As a result, our relationship was generally hostile. There were positive
                        interludes, but these were often atmospheric and did not get at the roots of
                        tension. Accords were reached on particular questions, but there was no
                        broad momentum in our relationship. Improvements in the climate were quickly
                        replaced by confrontation and, occasionally, crisis. The basic pattern was a
                        tense jockeying for tactical advantage around the globe.</p>
                    <p>This was dangerous and unsatisfactory. The threat of a major conflict between
                        us hung over the world. This in turn exacerbated local and regional
                        tensions. And our two countries not only risked collision but were
                        constrained from working positively on common problems.</p>
                    <pb n="34" facs="0065" xml:id="pg_34"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The weight of China rested outside the international
                            framework.</hi> This was due partly to its own attitude and its
                        preoccupation with internal problems, and partly to the policies of the
                        outside world, most importantly the United States. In any event, this
                        Administration inherited two decades of mutual estrangement and hostility.
                        Here the problem was not one of a fluctuating relationship but rather of
                        having no relationship at all. The People’s Republic of China was separated
                        not only from us but essentially from the world as a whole.</p>
                    <p>China also exemplified the great changes that had occurred in the Communist
                        world. For years our guiding principle was containment of what we considered
                        a monolithic challenge. In the 1960’s the forces of nationalism dissolved
                        Communist unity into divergent centers of power and doctrine, and our
                        foreign policy began to differentiate among the Communist capitals. But this
                        process could not be truly effective so long as we were cut off from
                        one-quarter of the globe’s people. China in turn was emerging from its
                        isolation and might be more receptive to overtures from foreign
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>The gulf between China and the world distorted the international landscape.
                        We could not effectively reduce tensions in Asia without talking to Peking.
                        China’s isolation compounded its own sense of insecurity. There could not be
                        a stable world order with a major power remaining outside and hostile to
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Our principal alliances with Western Europe and Japan
                            needed adjustment.</hi> After the devastation of the Second World War we
                        had helped allies and former adversaries alike. Fueled by our assistance and
                        secure behind our military shield, they regained their economic vigor and
                        political confidence.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the postwar period our bonds with Europe had rested on American
                        prescriptions as well as resources. We provided much of the leadership and
                        planning for common defense. We took the diplomatic lead. The dollar was
                        unchallenged. But by the time this Administration took office, the tide was
                        flowing toward greater economic and political assertiveness by our allies.
                        European unity which we had always encouraged, was raising new issues in
                        Atlantic relations. The economic revival of Europe was straining the
                        Atlantic monetary and commercial framework. The relaxation of tensions with
                        the Communist world was generating new doctrines of defense and
                        diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>The imperatives of change were equally evident in our Pacific partnership
                        with Japan. Its recovery of strength and self-assurance carried political
                        and psychological implications for our relationship. Its spectacular
                        economic growth had made it the world’s third industrial power; our entire
                        economic relationship was undergoing transformation. The earlier paternalism
                        of U.S.-Japanese relations no longer suited either partner.</p>
                    <pb n="35" facs="0066" xml:id="pg_35"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Vietnam war dominated our attention and was sapping
                            our self-confidence.</hi> Our role and our costs had steadily grown
                        without decisive impact on the conflict. The outlook at the conference table
                        was bleak. The war was inhibiting our policy abroad and fostering dissent
                        and self-doubt at home. There was no prospect of either an end to the
                        fighting or an end to our involvement.</p>
                    <p>Although the historical imperatives for a new international approach existed
                        independently, the war made this challenge at once more urgent and more
                        difficult. More than any other factor, it threatened to exhaust the American
                        people’s willingness to sustain a reliable foreign policy. As much as any
                        other factor, the way we treated it would shape overseas attitudes and
                        American psychology.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The context for our national security policy was
                            fundamentally altered.</hi> From the mid-1940’s to the late 1960’s we
                        had moved from America’s nuclear monopoly to superiority to rough strategic
                        balance with the Soviet Union. This created fresh challenges to our security
                        and introduced new calculations in our diplomacy. The U.S. defense effort
                        remained disproportionate to that of our allies who had grown much stronger.
                        The threats from potential enemies were more varied and less blatant than
                        during the more rigid bipolar era. These changes, combined with spiraling
                        military costs and the demands of domestic programs, were prompting
                        reexamination of our defense doctrines and posture. They were underlining
                        the importance of arms control as an element in national security. They were
                        also leading some in this country to call for policies that would seriously
                        jeopardize our safety and world stability.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Around the world, friends were ready for a greater role in
                            shaping their own security and well-being.</hi> In the 1950’s and 1960’s
                        other nations had looked to America for ideas and resources, and they found
                        us a willing provider of both. Our motives were sound, the needs were clear,
                        and we had many successes. By 1969, scores of new nations, having emerged
                        from colonial status or dependency on major powers, were asserting
                        themselves with greater assurance and autonomy.</p>
                    <p>Four years ago this growing capacity of friends was not reflected in the
                        balance of contributions to security and development. This meant that others
                        could do more, and the United States need do proportionately less, in the
                        provision of material resources. More fundamentally, it meant that
                        increasingly the devising of plans belonged outside of Washington. The
                        sweeping American presence was likely to strain our capabilities and to
                        stifle the initiative of others.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">There were new issues that called for global
                            cooperation.</hi> These challenges were not susceptible to national
                        solutions or relevant to national ideologies. The vast frontiers of space
                        and the oceans beckoned international exploration for humanity’s gain.
                        Pollution of air, sea, and land could not be contained behind national
                        frontiers. The brutal tools of as<pb n="36" facs="0067" xml:id="pg_36"
                        />sassination, kidnapping, and hijacking could be used to further any cause
                        in any country. No nation’s youth was immune from the scourge of
                        international drug traffic. The immediate tragedies of national disasters
                        and the longer-term threat of overpopulation were humanitarian, not
                        political, concerns.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">At home we faced pressures that threatened to swing
                            America from over-extension in the world to heedless withdrawal from
                            it.</hi> The American people had supported the burdens of global
                        leadership with enthusiasm and generosity into the 1960’s. But after almost
                        three decades, our enthusiasm was waning and the results of our generosity
                        were being questioned. Our policies needed change, not only to match new
                        realities in the world but also to meet a new mood in America. Many
                        Americans were no longer willing to support the sweeping range of our
                        postwar role. It had drained our financial, and especially our
                        psychological, reserves. Our friends clearly were able to do more. The
                        Vietnam experience was hastening our awareness of change. Voices in this
                        country were claiming that we had to jettison global concerns and turn
                        inward in order to meet our domestic problems.</p>
                    <p>Therefore the whole underpinning of our foreign policy was in jeopardy. The
                        bipartisan consensus that once existed for a vigorous American
                        internationalism was now being torn apart. Some of the most active
                        proponents of America’s commitment in the world in previous decades were now
                        pressing for indiscriminate disengagement. What was once seen as America’s
                        overseas obligation was now seen as our overseas preoccupation. What was
                        once viewed as America’s unselfishness was now viewed as our naivete. By
                        1969 we faced the danger that public backing for a continuing world role
                        might be swept away by fatigue, frustration and over-reaction.</p>
                    <p rend="center">This Administration’s Approach</p>
                    <p>We were determined to shape new policies to deal with each of these problems.
                        But our first requirement was philosophic. We needed a fresh vision to
                        inspire and to integrate our efforts.</p>
                    <p>We began with the conviction that a major American commitment to the world
                        continued to be indispensable. The many changes in the postwar landscape did
                        not alter this central fact. America’s strength was so vast, our involvement
                        so broad, and our concerns so deep, that to remove our influence would set
                        off tremors around the globe. Friends would despair, adversaries would be
                        tempted, and our own national security would soon be threatened. There was
                        no escaping the reality of our enormous influence for peace.</p>
                    <p>But the new times demanded a new definition of our involvement. For more than
                        a score of years our foreign policy had been driven by a global mission that
                        only America could fulfill—to furnish political <pb n="37" facs="0068"
                            xml:id="pg_37"/>leadership, provide for the common defense, and promote
                        economic development. Allies were weak and other nations were young, threats
                        were palpable and American power was dominant.</p>
                    <p>By 1969, a mission of this scale was no longer valid abroad or supportable at
                        home. Allies had grown stronger and young nations were maturing, threats
                        were diversified and American power was offset. It was time to move from a
                        paternal mission <hi rend="italic">for</hi> others to a cooperative mission
                            <hi rend="italic">with</hi> others. Convinced as we were that a strong
                        American role remained essential for world stability, we knew, too, that a
                        peace that depends primarily on the exertions of one nation is inherently
                        fragile.</p>
                    <p>So we saw the potential and the imperative of a pluralistic world. We
                        believed we could move from an environment of emergencies to a more stable
                        international system. We made our new purpose a global structure of
                        peace—comprehensive because it would draw on the efforts of other countries;
                        durable because if countries helped to build it, they would also help to
                        maintain it.</p>
                    <p>To pursue this fundamental vision, we had to move across a wide and
                        coordinated front, with mutually reinforcing policies for each challenge we
                        faced.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Peace could not depend solely on the uneasy equilibrium
                            between two nuclear giants.</hi> We had a responsibility to work for
                        positive relations with the Soviet Union. But there was ample proof that
                        assertions of good will or transitory changes in climate would not erase the
                        hard realities of ideological opposition, geopolitical rivalry, competing
                        alliances, or military competition. We were determined not to lurch
                        along—with isolated agreements vulnerable to sudden shifts of course in
                        political relations, with peaks and valleys based on atmosphere, with
                        incessant tension and maneuvering. We saw as well that there were certain
                        mutual interests that we could build upon. As the two powers capable of
                        global destruction, we had a common stake in preserving peace.</p>
                    <p>Thus we decided to follow certain principles in our policy toward the Soviet
                        Union. We would engage in concrete negotiations designed to produce specific
                        agreements, both where differences existed and where cooperation was
                        possible. We would work with Moscow across a broad front, believing that
                        progress in one area would induce progress in others. Through the gathering
                        momentum of individual accords we would seek to create vested interests on
                        both sides in restraint and the strengthening of peace. But this process
                        would require a reduction in tactical maneuvering at each other’s expense in
                        favor of our shared interest in avoiding calamitous collision, in profiting
                        from cooperation, and in building a more stable world.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Peace could not exclude a fourth of humanity.</hi> The
                        longer-term prospects for peace required a new relationship with the
                        People’s Republic of China. Only if China’s weight was reflected in the
                        international <pb n="38" facs="0069" xml:id="pg_38"/>system would it have
                        the incentive, and sense of shared responsibility, to maintain the peace.
                        Furthermore, the time was past when one nation could claim to speak for a
                        bloc of states; we would deal with countries on the basis of their actions,
                        not abstract ideological formulas. Our own policies could be more flexible
                        if we did not assume the permanent enmity of China. The United States had a
                        traditional interest in an independent and peaceful China. We seemed to have
                        no fundamental interests that need collide in the longer sweep of history.
                        There was, indeed, rich potential benefit for our two peoples in a more
                        normal relationship.</p>
                    <p>So we launched a careful process of private diplomacy and public steps to
                        engage the People’s Republic of China with us and involve it more fully in
                        the world. We did so, confident that a strong, independent China was in our
                        national interest; resolved that such a process need not—and would not—be
                        aimed at any other country; and looking for a reciprocal attitude on the
                        part of the Chinese.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Peace must draw upon the vitality of our friends.</hi> Our
                        alliances with Western Europe and Japan would continue as major pillars of
                        our foreign policy, but they had not kept pace with the changed
                        international environment. We thus sought to forge more equal partnerships
                        based on a more balanced contribution of both resources and plans.</p>
                    <p>America had been the automatic source of political leadership and economic
                        power. Now we needed new modes of action that would accommodate our
                        partners’ new dynamism. The challenge was to reconcile traditional unity
                        with new diversity. While complete integration of policy was impossible,
                        pure unilateralism would be destructive.</p>
                    <p>Before, we were allied in containment of a unified Communist danger. Now
                        Communism had taken various forms; our alliances had stabilized the European
                        and Northeast Asian environments; and we had laid the foundations for
                        negotiation. We had to decide together not only what we were against, but
                        what we were for.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Peace required the ending of an ongoing war.</hi> Our
                        approach to the Vietnam conflict and our shaping of a new foreign policy
                        were inextricably linked. Naturally, our most urgent concern was to end the
                        war. But we had to end it—or at least our involvement—in a way that would
                        continue to make possible a responsible American role in the world.</p>
                    <p>We could not continue on the course we inherited, which promised neither an
                        end to the conflict nor to our involvement. At the same time, we would not
                        abandon our friends, for we wanted to shape a structure of peace based in
                        large measure on American steadiness. So we sought peace with honor—through
                        negotiation if possible, through Vietnamization if the enemy gave us no
                        choice. The phased shifting of defense responsibilities to the South
                        Vietnamese would give them the time and means to adjust. It would assure the
                        American people that our <pb n="39" facs="0070" xml:id="pg_39"/>own
                        involvement was not open-ended. It would preserve our credibility abroad and
                        our cohesion at home.</p>
                    <p>Given the enemy’s attitude, peace was likely to take time, and other problems
                        in the world could not wait. So we moved promptly to shape a new approach to
                        allies and adversaries. And by painting on this larger canvas we sought both
                        to put the Vietnam war in perspective and to speed its conclusion by
                        demonstrating to Hanoi that continued conflict did not frustrate our global
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Peace needed America’s strength.</hi> Modifications in our
                        defense policy were required, but one central truth persisted—neither our
                        nation nor peace in the world could be secure without our military power. If
                        superiority was no longer practical, inferiority would be unthinkable.</p>
                    <p>We were determined to maintain a national defense second to none. This would
                        be a force for stability in a world of evolving partnerships and changing
                        doctrines. This was essential to maintain the confidence of our friends and
                        the respect of our adversaries. At the same time, we would seek
                        energetically to promote national and international security through arms
                        control negotiations.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Peace involved a fresh dimension of international
                            cooperation.</hi> A new form of multilateral diplomacy was prompted by a
                        new set of issues. These challenges covered a wide range—the promise of
                        exploration, the pollution of our planet, the perils of crime—but they were
                        alike in going beyond the traditional considerations of doctrine and
                        geography. They required cooperation that reached not only across boundaries
                        but often around the globe. So we resolved to work both with friends and
                        adversaries, in the United Nations and other forums, to practice partnership
                        on a global scale.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Above all, peace demanded the responsible participation of
                            all nations.</hi> With great efforts during the postwar period we had
                        promoted the revitalization of former powers and the growing assurance of
                        new states. For this changed world we needed a new philosophy that would
                        reflect and reconcile two basic principles: <hi rend="italic">A structure of
                            peace requires the greater participation of other nations, but it also

                    <p>To these ends, we developed the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>

                        was central to our approach to major allies in the Atlantic and Pacific. But
                        it also shaped our attitude toward those in <pb n="40" facs="0071"
                            xml:id="pg_40"/>Latin America, Asia, and Africa with whom we were
                        working in formal alliances or friendship.</p>
                    <p>Our primary purpose was to invoke greater efforts by others—not so much to
                        lighten our burdens as to increase their commitment to a new and peaceful
                        structure. This would mean that increasingly they would man their own
                        defenses and furnish more of the funds for their security and economic
                        development. The corollary would be the reduction of the American share of
                        defense or financial contributions.</p>
                    <p>More fundamental than this material redistribution, however, was a
                        psychological reorientation. Nations had habitually relied on us for
                        political leadership. Much time and energy went into influencing decisions
                        in Washington. Our objective now was to encourage them to play a greater
                        role in formulating plans and programs. For when others design their
                        security and their development, they make their destiny truly their own. And
                        when plans are their plans, they are more motivated to make them
                        realities.</p>
                    <p>The lowering of our profile was not an end in itself. Other countries needed
                        to do more, but they could not do so without a concerned America. Their role
                        had to be increased, but this would prove empty unless we did what we must.
                        We could not go from overinvolvement to neglect. A changing world needed the
                        continuity of America’s strength.</p>
                    <p>Thus we made clear that the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                        Doctrine represented a new definition of American leadership, not
                        abandonment of that leadership. In my 1971 Report,<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3"

                        responsible balance:</p>
                    <p>“The <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine recognizes that
                        we cannot abandon friends, and must not transfer burdens too swiftly. We
                        must strike a balance between doing too much and thus preventing
                        self-reliance, and doing too little and thus undermining
                        self-confidence.</p>
                    <p>“The balance we seek abroad is crucial. We only compound insecurity if we
                        modify our protective or development responsibilities without giving our
                        friends the time and the means to adjust, materially and psychologically, to
                        a new form of American participation in the world.</p>
                    <p>“Precipitate shrinking of the American role would not bring peace. It would
                        not reduce America’s stake in a turbulent world. It would not solve our
                        problems, either abroad or at home.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Peace had a domestic dimension.</hi> Steadiness abroad
                        required steadiness at home. America could continue to make its vital
                        contribution in the world only if Americans understood the need and
                        supported the ef<pb n="41" facs="0072" xml:id="pg_41"/>fort to do so. But
                        understanding and support for a responsible foreign policy were in serious
                        jeopardy in 1969. Years of burdens, Cold War tensions, and a difficult war
                        threatened to undermine our constancy.</p>
                    <p>While new policies were required to meet transformed conditions abroad, they
                        were equally imperative because of the changing climate at home. Americans
                        needed a new positive vision of the world and our place in it. In order to
                        continue to do what only America could, we had to demonstrate that our
                        friends were doing more. While maintaining strong defenses, we also had to
                        seek national security through negotiations with adversaries. And where
                        American families were most directly affected, we had to gain a peace with
                        honor to win domestic support for our new foreign policy as well as to make
                        it credible abroad.</p>
                    <p>We have thus paid great attention, as in these Reports, to the articulation,
                        as well as the implementation, of our new role in the world.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are the remainder of the introduction, discussing
                        accomplishments, disappointments, and goals, and the 158-page body of the
                        report, which is divided into 7 parts.]</p>
                    <p rend="center">CONCLUSION</p>
                    <p>In the past four years, there have been fundamental changes and signal
                        successes. We have cleared away vestiges of the past. We have erased or
                        moderated hostilities. And we are strengthening partnerships.</p>
                    <p>The specific events or policies, however important, reflect a more profound
                        enterprise. We are seeking the philosophical, as well as the practical,
                        reorientation of our foreign policy. This is the primary challenge of a
                        radically different world. If America is to provide the leadership that only
                        it can, Americans must identify with new visions and purposes.</p>
                    <p>As we look toward this nation’s two hundredth birthday, we shall continue our
                        efforts—with the people and the Congress—to create this new consensus.</p>
                    <p>In the transition from the bipolar world of American predominance to the
                        multipolar world of shared responsibilities, certain themes need emphasis.
                        They indicate not only what our approach is, but what it is not.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">We seek a stable structure, not a classical balance of
                            power.</hi> Undeniably, national security must rest upon a certain
                        equilibrium between potential adversaries. The United States cannot entrust
                        its destiny entirely, or even largely, to the goodwill of others. Neither
                        can we expect other countries so to mortgage their future. Solid security
                        involves external restraints on potential opponents as well as
                        self-restraint.</p>
                    <p>Thus a certain balance of power is inherent in any international system and
                        has its place in the one we envision. But it is not the over<pb n="42"
                            facs="0073" xml:id="pg_42"/>riding concept of our foreign policy. First
                        of all, our approach reflects the realities of the nuclear age. The
                        classical concept of balance of power included continual maneuvering for
                        marginal advantages over others. In the nuclear era this is both unrealistic
                        and dangerous. It is unrealistic because when both sides possess such
                        enormous power, small additional increments cannot be translated into
                        tangible advantage or even usable political strength. And it is dangerous
                        because attempts to seek tactical gains might lead to confrontation which
                        could be catastrophic.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, our approach includes the element of consensus. All nations,
                        adversaries and friends alike, must have a stake in preserving the
                        international system. They must feel that their principles are being
                        respected and their national interests secured. They must, in short, see
                        positive incentive for keeping the peace, not just the dangers of breaking
                        it. If countries believe global arrangements threaten their vital concerns,
                        they will challenge them. If the international environment meets their vital
                        concerns, they will work to maintain it. Peace requires mutual accommodation
                        as well as mutual restraint.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Negotiation with adversaries does not alter our more
                            fundamental ties with friends.</hi> We have made a concerted effort to
                        move from confrontation to negotiation. We have done well. At the same time,
                        our determination to reduce divisions has not eroded distinctions between
                        friends and adversaries. Our alliances remain the cornerstones of our
                        foreign policy. They reflect shared values and purposes. They involve major
                        economic interests. They provide the secure foundation on which to base
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Although their forms must be adapted to new conditions, these ties are
                        enduring. We have no intention of sacrificing them in efforts to engage
                        adversaries in the shaping of peace. Indeed such efforts cannot succeed, nor
                        can they have lasting meaning, without the bonds of traditional friendships.
                        There is no higher objective than the strengthening of our partnerships.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Détente does not mean the end of danger.</hi> Improvements
                        in both the tone and substance of our relations have indeed reduced tensions
                        and heightened the prospects for peace. But these processes are not
                        automatic or easy. They require vigilance and firmness and exertion. Nothing
                        would be more dangerous than to assume prematurely that dangers have
                        disappeared.</p>
                    <p>Thus we maintain strong military power even as we seek mutual limitation and
                        reduction of arms. We do not mistake climate for substance. We base our
                        policies on the actions and capabilities of others, not just on estimates of
                        their intentions.</p>
                    <p>Détente is not the same as lasting peace. And peace does not guarantee
                        tranquility or mean the end of contention. The world will hold perils for as
                        far ahead as we can see.</p>
                    <pb n="43" facs="0074" xml:id="pg_43"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">We intend to share responsibilities, not abdicate
                            them.</hi> We have emphasized the need for other countries to take on
                        more responsibilities for their security and development. The tangible
                        result has often been a reduction in our overseas presence or our share of
                        contributions. But our purpose is to continue our commitment to the world in
                        ways we can sustain, not to camouflage a retreat. We took these steps only
                        when our friends were prepared for them. They have been successfully carried
                        out because American backing remained steady. They have helped to maintain
                        support in this country for a responsible foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>I underlined the vital importance of the redefined American role two years
                        ago:</p>
                    <p>“Our participation remains crucial. Because of the abundance of our resources
                        and the stretch of our technology, America’s impact on the world remains
                        enormous, whether by our action or by our inaction. Our awareness of the
                        world is too keen, and our concern for peace too deep for us to remove the
                        measure of stability which we have provided for the past 25 years.”</p>
                    <p>Measured against the challenges we faced and the goals we set, we can take
                        satisfaction in the record of the past four years. Our progress has been
                        more marked in reducing tensions than in restructuring partnerships. We have
                        negotiated an end to a war and made future wars less likely by improving
                        relations with major adversaries. Our bonds with old friends have proved
                        durable during these years of profound change. But we are still searching
                        for more balanced relationships. This will be our most immediate concern,
                        even as we pursue our other goals.</p>
                    <p>Where peace is newly planted, we shall work to make it thrive.</p>
                    <p>Where bridges have been built, we shall work to make them stronger.</p>
                    <p>Where friendships have endured, we shall work to make them grow.<note n="4"

                        Let me tell you one thing I—that I, particularly, would like is that—I know
                        that the social world is a total pain in the rump, but, to the extent that
                        you can, if you could get around, and have your colleagues get around, and
                        give us an evaluation of the people on the way up, and who’s—</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: And you’ve got to understand:
                        Mao will soon be leaving; Chou En-lai is in his 70s, but he’s as vigorous as
                        a bee—terrific. You’re gonna really like him. You’ll like them both. Chou
                        En-lai is an amazing man because of—and—but, on the other hand, except for
                        some men in their 30s—late 30s and 40s, I don’t see much coming up. And then
                        I think, you know, you can do that. Look around, see who the power is.
                        That’s the one thing that would be very important for us to know. Isn’t
                        it?</p>

                        the world changes. Well, there’s that. Then, of course, the—just your, you

                        It’s no problem for the next 5 years, but in the next 20 years, it’s the

                        could, you know, constantly, of course, whenever you’re talking—they’re very
                        subtle, but—and they’re not like the Russians, who, of course, slobber at
                        flattery, and all that sort of thing—but, you should let them know how—two
                        things: one, from a personal standpoint, how much I appreciated our welcome
                        when we were there. The second thing, we look forward to sometime returning.

                        proper way. And fourth—and I think this is the most important—that I look
                        upon the Chinese and American relationship as, really, the key to peace in

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: —the Chinese must be

                        know well.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: They think that India’s
                        becoming a—you know, a sort of a satellite of Russia. And, of course, the
                        Japanese, they have a fear and respect for them, as well. So, with the
                        Japanese, sort of say the right thing in terms of, “We want to get along
                        with Japan,” and the rest. And, it’s very important that we have our—that we
                        maintain our—in other words, the shield there, because, otherwise, Japan
                        goes into business for itself, and that’s not in our interest. And the other
                        point that they’re fairly terribly interested in, looking at the world
                        scene—another point, apart from the fact they’ll go through the usual jazz
                        as to [unclear] revolutions [unclear]. That’s fine. What they do in Africa,
                        I don’t care anymore [unclear]. But, Europe—they don’t want us to get out of
                        Europe, because they realize as long as the Russians have a tie down in

                        I must say, they are—they really are quite—not only startling, but they’re
                        sort of fascinating to read.</p>

                        think they’re absolutely fascinating.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah. A lot of history was
                        made there.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BDKE_1">Bruce</persName>: It was indeed. I think
                        probably the most significant history, diplomatic history, of our time. No

                        the time being. Without any hesitation I can tell you I always thought the
                        preservation of good relations should have sort of ordinary courtesies and
                        what not in the beginning, it’ll probably be all business, but you try and
                        get to know as many people as possible. [unclear]</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: But, let them think that we
                        are strong and respected, and that we are not going to be pushed around by
                        the Russians, or by anybody else. The Mideast, they could help us there. We

                        worrying how about does one explain to the Chinese [unclear] if you want to
                        preserve a relationship, which is of great importance to us, an amiable
                        meaningful relationship with Russia? The Chinese are undoubtedly our
                        favorites, certainly, between the two. But—</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: The Russians are saying,
                        “Now, look, this is very important, that <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> is having another meeting with <persName

                        agreements coming out of that meeting.” But the important thing there is to
                        remember that Russia and the United States are superpowers, that we—that our
                        interests do rub together in the Mideast and in Europe, particularly.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BDKE_1">Bruce</persName>: Yes.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: That their rubbing together
                        is a danger that is almost unbelievably great, and that under these
                        circumstances, that we feel that what we have to do is to try to limit that
                        danger as much as we can through communication. But, on the other hand, we
                        do not consider putting it quite bluntly as between the two. We consider the
                        Soviet, be<pb n="49" facs="0080" xml:id="pg_49"/>cause of its power, and of
                        its long history of expansionism, we consider it more of a danger that we
                        have to deal with than we do China, even, which has a longer history of,
                        frankly, defense. Now, I think a little of that history is—</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BDKE_1">Bruce</persName>: Yes.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: —is well worth saying. In
                        other words—</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BDKE_1">Bruce</persName>: Yes.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: —[unclear] Also, I’d be very
                        blunt about it. Just say that you’ve had a long—you’ve talked with the
                        President, and there’s no illusions. Our systems are different, both with
                        the Chinese and the Russians. They’re better Communists than the Russians
                        are today. But, we finally plan to get back to national—natural interests.
                        And the President considers—he’s a man of the Pacific—he considers that
                        China and America have a hell of a lot more in common than Russia and
                        America, and that is the God’s truth.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BDKE_1">Bruce</persName>: Yes, that’s true—</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: And that, therefore—that
                        looking at the historical process, I want to work toward that direction. And
                        I think that’s what we have to do. But the Chinese-American relationship can
                        be the great lynchpin of peace in the world.</p>

                        you one thing: normally, on these visits, when he goes why he—he meets—and,
                        this is very important, he has sometimes met alone with their leaders and so
                        forth.</p>

                    <p>The President: We will have this type of meeting monthly or every three
                        weeks. In Paris, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> has
                        said we can’t enforce the agreement<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">Reference is
                            to the Paris Peace Accords. See <ref target="#d1fn3">footnote 3,

                        stick.</p>
                    <p>The problem in Southeast Asia is blown out of proportion because of Cambodia.
                        Article 20 clearly provides for their withdrawal from Cambodia and Laos. But
                        that has not been done, and that is the problem.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of bombing is not to get into a war in Cambodia, but to enforce
                        the peace in Vietnam. We don’t want to encourage the Communists to go on the
                        rampage again.</p>
                    <p>We have a carrot. I know the tremendous unpopularity of North Vietnamese aid,
                        but most of us agree that if we get North Vietnamese cooperation, the best
                        way to proceed is to help in reconstruction in <pb n="52" facs="0083"
                            xml:id="pg_52"/>Southeast Asia. The meetings are going forward and if
                        they don’t succeed, Congress is responsible for the failure. This is
                        restricted to this room.</p>
                    <p>The North Vietnamese have other disincentives:</p>
                    <p>—They don’t want a long war.</p>
                    <p>—They want a relationship to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>—They have problems with their major allies.</p>
                    <p>I don’t discuss it, but put yourself in the Chinese and Soviet Union’s shoes.
                        Why would they risk a relationship to the U.S. for the purposes of a small
                        irrational ally?</p>
                    <p>So it all fits together—our relations. The Soviet Union is very important in
                        what happens in Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. The Chinese too in
                        Asia.</p>

                        visit.</p>
                    <p>In Vietnam, there is a vigorous economy and the South Vietnamese will survive
                        a long time.</p>
                    <p>What happens in Cambodia and Laos, however, affects the states of Southeast
                        Asia and also the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>. If we fail there,
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> will see us as a paper tiger.</p>
                    <p>In the Middle East is the problem of Israel. Israel’s lobby is so strong that
                        Congress is not reasonable. When we try to get Israel reasonable, the excuse
                        is an Israeli election, the U.S. election, or something.</p>
                    <p>This is my primary occupation. Please don’t take an all-out Israeli line. The
                        Israelis are attractive and efficient, but the stakes are big.</p>
                    <p>We are trying to get this difficult issue off dead center.</p>
                    <p>The basic point is Israel can defeat the Arabs with our aid. But if our
                        relationship with the Soviet Union collapses, and the Soviet Union aids the
                        Arabs, Israel will be swamped. This is why we need to have <pb n="53"

                            target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss>. We have to have policies which don’t
                        allow an obsession with one state to destroy our status in the Middle
                        East.</p>
                    <p>These are problems—but when we came into office, we weren’t talking to the
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> and not really to the Soviet Union.
                        There was war in the Middle East and there were high casualties in Southeast
                        Asia.</p>
                    <p>We have come a long way, but we must realize we never would have gotten here
                        if we had had the thinking which dominates the Senate and much of the press.
                        A weak U.S. which can’t command respect, we will find. So if we need three
                        billion to balance it, the easy thing is to squeeze it from <gloss

                    <p>I stand for a strong U.S. because no one else can keep stability in the
                        world. Do you want a world where there is a prosperous U.S. but a leaner,
                        tougher country decides the issues of peace and freedom in the world? You
                        are going through a tough period. Most of the people in this Administration
                        are fine. We have come a long way and the improvement is because of us. [War

                    <p>[Omitted here are introductory comments.]</p>
                    <p>Now, let me come to the briefing and why I decided to have a briefing.
                        Incidentally, we had first thought it would be a classified briefing, but
                        while we knew there was no problem insofar as leaks as far as this group was
                        concerned, our friends in the press very vigorously objected, and they said,
                        “Look, with 600 there, let us come, too.”</p>
                    <p>So, welcome. We are glad to have our members of the press here. This will be
                        on the record.</p>
                    <p>I will, however, speak quite bluntly about our foreign policy and our defense
                        policy. I will try to tell you as much as I can without divulging any
                        classified information, and I hope that you will take to heart some of the
                        things that I say and, particularly, pick up the challenge that I am going
                        to give you at the conclusion of my remarks today.</p>
                    <p>I begin with the question: Was it worth it? And I look over this group, and I
                        remember having talked to a half dozen of you in my office. I think of what
                        you went through, and I think of what you have come back to. And when you
                        ask that question, was it worth it, you can think in personal terms, or you
                        can think in much broader terms.</p>
                    <p>You could say, oh yes, it was worth it because we proved that we could tough
                        it through. And thank God you did, because your faith meant a great deal to
                        us.</p>
                    <p>But I would like to put it in the larger sense. Your sacrifice and the
                        sacrifice of all of your colleagues and comrades who died in Vietnam, and
                        the sacrifice of all who have served in Vietnam, will have been worth it
                        only if we build a world of peace now. That is what it was all about.</p>
                    <p>We didn’t go to Vietnam for the purpose of conquering North Vietnam. We
                        didn’t begin this war. We haven’t begun any war in this century, as you
                        know. That is the greatness of U.S. foreign policy. We make our mistakes,
                        but we always have as our motives defending peace, not breaking it,
                        defending freedom, not destroying it.</p>
                    <pb n="55" facs="0086" xml:id="pg_55"/>
                    <p>But when we think in terms of whether your sacrifice then was worth it, we
                        have to think then about the broader aspects of peace, whether or not the
                        world you come back to, the America you come back to, is a better world or
                        is it, shall we say, a world that is not as safe as when you went to Hanoi
                        or whatever area you were kept in captivity.</p>
                    <p>I cannot put it in the context of 6½ or 7 years, which some of you, of
                        course, have been away. But I can put it in the context of the years I have
                        been in this office. And perhaps we can see in perspective where we have
                        been and where we are, but more important, where we are going to go.</p>
                    <p>First, when I came into this office 4½ years ago, 300 a week were being
                        killed in action in Vietnam. There was no plan to end the war, no hope that
                        it was going to be ended. Many of you were already prisoners of war. You had
                        no hope.</p>
                    <p>Looking at the world scene, the United States had no communication whatever,
                        in any meaningful sense, with the leaders of one-fourth of all the people in
                        the world, those who govern the People’s Republic of China. We were in
                        constant confrontation with the Soviet Union, the other super power on the
                        Earth, with no thought or even hope that there was a chance for arms control
                        or trade or a lessening of tension between these two great super powers.</p>
                    <p>There were other troubled areas in the world. Some of them still are
                        troubled. But looking at those three areas and seeing what has happened
                        since, and then looking at the United States, we see some progress has been
                        made.</p>
                    <p>Also 4½ years ago, this Nation was torn by riots. Hundreds of campuses were
                        in flames. The American people seemed to have lost their way. There was a
                        desire to move away from responsibilities in the world. There was a lack of
                        national pride, a lack of patriotism. I don’t mean among all the people, not
                        even among a majority, but it was there. There was a crisis in terms of
                        whether America, the greatest hope for peace in the world today, would dash
                        that hope or whether it would be worthy of that hope. That was the situation
                        4½ years ago.</p>
                    <p>Now in describing that situation, I do not speak critically of those who
                        preceded me in this office. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John
                            Kennedy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Lyndon
                            Johnson</persName> loved this country. They worked for peace as I have
                        tried to work for peace. They felt for you as I feel for you.</p>
                    <p>What I am simply saying is that in January of 1969 we did have a critical
                        situation, and we started to move on it. And how I wish we could have moved
                        faster. I remember that first Christmas in ’69. I met with a group of the
                        representatives of the League of Families down in <pb n="56" facs="0087"
                            xml:id="pg_56"/>the library,<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">See 1969 volume,

                        these wonderful, remarkable women, and I saw their faith and their courage
                        and their love of country, and I heard them tell me that their husbands had
                        not gone to Vietnam simply for the purpose of getting back. In other words,
                        they rejected totally the idea of “Get out, if you will give us our
                        prisoners.”</p>
                    <p>They said, in effect, and they didn’t put it this way, but one of you put it
                        very well, “Bring our men home, but bring them home on their feet and not on
                        their knees.” And that is what we have done.</p>
                    <p>And so that was our goal over those 4 years. That is why we couldn’t achieve
                        it perhaps quite as fast as we would have liked.</p>
                    <p>But the year 1972 saw remarkable progress, as you know. The year 1972, moving
                        into 1973, in January, saw the return of all Americans from Vietnam, all of
                        our combat forces, the return of all of our prisoners of war, the end of the
                        American involvement in Vietnam, a peace agreement which, if adhered to,
                        will mean peace for Vietnam and Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>That was one accomplishment. That is the one that most people talk about.
                        They say, “Thank God that war is over. Thank God we have got peace.”</p>
                    <p>But in a broader sense, other events took place that will have even more
                        meaning to the world and to peace than your return and the end of the war in
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>China, for example. That initiative, which was undertaken in early 1972,
                        began in ’71, the negotiations, has finally started communication between
                        the leaders of the People’s Republic of China and the leaders of the United
                        States of America. Oh, it doesn’t mean they aren’t still Communists and that
                        we are not still people who love freedom, but it does mean that instead of
                        having hanging over us, looking down the road 10, 15, 20 years from now, a
                        possible confrontation with a nation of the most able people in the world,
                        armed with nuclear weapons equal to our own, instead of having that, there
                        is a chance, a very good chance now, that we will have negotiations with
                        them rather than confrontation, and that is the key to peace in the
                        Pacific.</p>
                    <p>And then the second development was the meetings with the Soviet leaders.
                        This did not happen just over a period of 1972. We worked for the whole 4
                        years. But it culminated in the summit in Moscow.<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3"
                            >See <ref target="#d7fn4">footnote 4, Document 7</ref>.</note> You
                        perhaps heard something about it since your return. But looking at that
                        summit agreement, a great deal of emphasis can be placed on the aspects of
                        trade and our cooperation in space and other areas which are <pb n="57"
                            facs="0088" xml:id="pg_57"/>important, but the most significant
                        development, undoubtedly, was the first step, and a very important step, in
                        limiting the arms race in the nuclear field.</p>
                    <p>We have, therefore, an agreement with the Soviet Union on defensive nuclear
                        weapons, where we are both limited,<note n="4" xml:id="d12fn4">Reference is

                        are moving now toward getting a limitation in the offensive field.</p>
                    <p>And so those were the developments that occurred in the year 1972.</p>
                    <p>The other day I was talking to a Congressman. He is a Congressman who has
                        always voted for strong national defense. He said, “Mr. President, give me
                        an answer to my constituents to this question. They say, ‘Since we have made
                        such great progress towards peace, we have ended the war in Vietnam, we have
                        had this initiative with China and this initiative with the Soviet Union,
                        why can’t we now reduce our defenses regardless of what the other side does
                        and turn that money that we take away from defense to the very urgent
                        problems at home?’”</p>
                    <p>Let me tell you, gentlemen, there is nothing I would like to do more. A
                        President never likes to veto a bill when it is going to help somebody
                        anyplace in this country—our schools or our hospitals or anything that you
                        say.</p>
                    <p>But on the other hand, when we talk now about national defense, let me tell
                        you what the challenge is—and you can help in this respect—and what the
                        danger is, a mortal danger that we face insofar as reduction of our defenses
                        is concerned.</p>
                    <p>First, our defense budget has been reduced. With a new volunteer armed
                            force,<note n="5" xml:id="d12fn5">During the 1968 Presidential campaign,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> had pledged the
                            creation of an all-volunteer force. The administration established a
                            draft lottery system in 1969 and renewed the system in 1971. By 1972,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> announced that the AVF
                            would replace the Selective Service System by July 1973. See ibid., <ref

                                target="frus1969-76v34#d228">228</ref>.</note> considering the
                        increased costs and the like, we find that it is approximately a third
                        reduction of what it was in 1968.</p>
                    <p>But second, we must also look at this situation: When they say, “Now that we
                        have made all this progress in 1972 towards peace, let’s reduce our defenses
                        regardless of what the other side does,” what you are doing, in effect, is
                        advocating changing a game plan that has worked.</p>
                    <p>Let me put it this way: We wouldn’t have ended the war in Vietnam with honor,
                        we wouldn’t have had the initiative with China, and we would not have had,
                        without question, the arms control and other <pb n="58" facs="0089"
                            xml:id="pg_58"/>agreements with the Soviet Union, had the United States
                        not been strong and respected.</p>
                    <p>Strength without respect is meaningless. That was another reason why this war
                        had to be ended on an honorable basis, because otherwise we would have lost
                        respect, not only of our allies and the neutrals but also of our potential
                        adversaries in the world.</p>
                    <p>But when we see what has happened then, we find that the Soviet Union, at the
                        present time, is preparing to come to the United States for a return summit
                        visit in just a few weeks. We are going to have some very intensive
                        negotiations. They are even more important than the negotiations we had last
                        year, although those were the first and, therefore, the most newsworthy,
                        because they will move in arms control and other fields of enormous
                        importance to the future of the world.</p>
                    <p>But, gentlemen, let me tell you, in the event that the President of the
                        United States goes into meetings with the Soviet leaders, with the Congress
                        of the United States having unilaterally cut our defenses, then all hope for
                        an arms control agreement is completely destroyed. Because when you really
                        get down to it in the field of international diplomacy—and this is true in
                        all fields in life—you can’t get something from anybody else unless you have
                        something to give.</p>
                    <p>And I say to you, we must never send the President of the United States into
                        any negotiation with anybody as the head of the second strongest nation of
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>Now, gentlemen, if you should go out and make that kind of a statement, you
                        sometimes may find people say to you what they say to me: “Those who are for
                        a strong defense are for war, and those who are for disarmament are for
                        peace.” It is just the other way around. Disarmament can lead to peace only
                        if it is mutual. But let the day never come when we disarm and the other
                        side arms, because that will enormously increase the danger of war.</p>
                    <p>Let me describe it in more specific terms. For example, in the field of
                        offensive nuclear weapons, we are ready, and we believe they are ready, for
                        an agreement in which we will mutually agree that we will have a limitation
                        on the development of offensive nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>But in the event, before we go into the negotiations, we already have reduced
                        our own strength in that area, then their incentive for making a deal is
                        completely out the window, and we are second and they are first.</p>
                    <p>Let’s go further. Many of you have served in Europe, I know, and you know one
                        of the points that is going to come up in this Congress will be the problem
                        with regard to what we do about our forces in Europe. And Americans, 25
                        years after World War II, justifiably are concerned about the fact that we
                        carry such a heavy load in Europe.</p>
                    <pb n="59" facs="0090" xml:id="pg_59"/>
                    <p>Very well-intentioned men in the House and the Senate, therefore, say it is
                        time for us to bring our men home—half of them or a third of them or a
                        fourth of them, or what have you—regardless of what the other side does.</p>
                    <p>But here again, let’s look at what would happen. In the fall we are going to
                        have very significant negotiations with the Warsaw Pact countries for a
                        mutual reduction of forces in Europe, a reduction on our side and on theirs.
                        As long as it is a mutual reduction, the stability which is essential for
                        peace in that critical area of the world will be maintained.</p>
                    <p>But if, on the other hand, before we go into those negotiations this fall,
                        the United States unilaterally reduces its forces, all incentive that the
                        Warsaw Pact forces and that the Soviet Union would have to reduce theirs is
                        gone, and you would create that imbalance which would enormously increase
                        instability and the chances for war.</p>
                    <p>So, what I am saying to you is this: I am for limitation of armaments, and I
                        know every one of you is. I am for, certainly in the nuclear field, doing
                        everything that we can to reduce that danger that is hanging over the world
                        today.</p>
                    <p>But I also know that it is vitally important that in this field of limitation
                        of armaments that we remember that the United States of America is not a
                        threat to the peace of the world.</p>
                    <p>I have traveled in most of the countries of the world. I have been to the
                        Communist countries and to the free countries. I have yet to talk to a world
                        leader who believes that the United States of America threatens his peace or
                        his freedom. A strong United States is a force for peace; a weak United
                        States means that the peace will be threatened.</p>
                    <p>And so, that is why I say at this point, not that we want to be strong in
                        order to dominate anybody else—that period was long gone, if it ever did
                        exist in our own minds—but what we need to recognize is that we now have a
                        balance in the world. We must maintain that balance. And that is why, let us
                        keep our defenses up.</p>
                    <p>Oh, take the fat off, wherever we possibly can, but keep them up and be sure
                        in negotiations we go down only if the other side goes down, and if we do
                        that, then we contribute to the peace of the world in which we are all so
                        very much interested.</p>
                    <p>One other subject that is somewhat sensitive that I will touch upon only
                        briefly, that I would like to ask for your support on, is with regard to the
                        security of the kind of negotiations that we have had.</p>
                    <p>I want to be quite blunt. Had we not had secrecy, had we not had secret
                        negotiations with the North Vietnamese, had we not had secret negotiations
                        prior to the Soviet summit, had we not had secret negotiations over a period
                        of time with the Chinese leaders, let me say quite bluntly, there would have
                        been no China initiative, there would have been no limitation of arms for
                        the Soviet Union and no summit, and <pb n="60" facs="0091" xml:id="pg_60"
                        />had we not had that kind of security and that kind of secrecy that allowed
                        for the kind of exchange that is essential, you men would still be in Hanoi
                        rather than Washington today.</p>
                    <p>And let me say, I think it is time in this country to quit making national
                        heroes out of those who steal secrets and publish them in the
                            newspapers.<note n="6" xml:id="d12fn6">Presumably a reference to the
                            1971 unauthorized release of Vietnam war documentation, commonly known
                            as the Pentagon Papers.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Because, gentlemen, you see, in order to continue these great initiatives for
                        peace, we must have confidentiality, we must have secret communications. It
                        isn’t that we are trying to keep anything from the American people that the
                        American people should know. It isn’t that we are trying to keep something
                        from the press that the press should print. But it is that what we are
                        trying to do is to accomplish our goal, make a deal. And when we are dealing
                        with potential adversaries, those negotiations must have the highest degree
                        of confidentiality.</p>
                    <p>And I can assure you that in my term of office as President in the first 4
                        years, and also in this second 4 years, I am going to meet my responsibility
                        to protect the national security of the United States of America insofar as
                        our secrets are concerned.</p>
                    <p>And by our secrets, what I am saying here is not that we are concerned about
                        every little driblet here and there, but what I am concerned about is the
                        highest classified documents in our National Security Council files, in the
                        State Department, in the Defense Department, which if they get out, for
                        example, in our arms control negotiations with the Soviets, would let them
                        know our position before we ever got to the table. They don’t tell us
                        theirs. They have no problem keeping their secrets.</p>
                    <p>I don’t want, and you don’t want, their system and that kind of control, but
                        I say it is time for a new sense of responsibility in this country and a new
                        sense of dedication of everybody in the bureaucracy that if a document is
                        classified, keep it classified.</p>
                    <p>Now, gentlemen, I turn to the challenge for the future. I have talked about
                        the need for strength if we are going to have a mutual reduction of
                        armaments in the world and, therefore, of the threat to peace in the world.
                        I have talked about the need for national security where our highly
                        classified documents are concerned, so we can continue these enormously
                        important initiatives for peace.</p>
                    <p>I now want to talk about why the United States, after all that it has done
                        for the world in World War II, after the billions that it has poured out
                        since World War II, its sacrifices in Korea, its sacrifices in Vietnam, why
                        we, the American people, have to continue to carry this load.</p>
                    <pb n="61" facs="0092" xml:id="pg_61"/>
                    <p>As I said earlier, believe me, as President, what a relief it would be to
                        say, “Now that we have peace in Vietnam, we have a new relationship with
                        China and Russia, we can simply turn away from the problems of the world and
                        turn to the problems at home.”</p>
                    <p>I can assure you gentlemen that if we were to follow that course, we would
                        find very soon that we would be living in a terribly dangerous world. The
                        world is safer today than it was 4½ years ago. It can be more safe in the
                        years ahead. But that will only happen provided we follow the course that I
                        have tried to lay out to you here today.</p>
                    <p>As I look to that future, therefore, it is vitally important that the United
                        States continue to play the world role.</p>
                    <p>Let’s look at just this century. We don’t need to go back any further than
                        that. I can imagine some of you in those long hours of captivity were
                        thinking back over several centuries. But in any event, looking back just
                        over this century, World War I, the United States could stand aside. After
                        all, there was Britain, there was France, two great powers who thought as we
                        did about the world, and they could carry the load. And then we came in
                        toward the end. In World War II, the United States, for a time, could stand
                        aside because Britain was still strong, and France at the beginning had some
                        strength, but eventually we had to come in.</p>
                    <p>But today, look at the world. Among the free nations of the world there is no
                        one else, not the Japanese, as you well know, even though they have the
                        economic strength, they do not have the military strength and cannot be
                        allowed to acquire it under their constitution; and not one nation in
                        Europe, by itself, or Europe collectively, has the strength to be the
                        peacemaker in the world.</p>
                    <p>So, it is all right here. It is in America. It is in that Oval Office,
                        whoever is there, and it is there for the foreseeable future. In other
                        words, the United States must maintain its strength in order to play a role
                        between the great powers of the world and among the great powers of the
                        world of reducing the danger of war, because our ideals and our
                        goals—subject as they can be to much criticism as far as tactics are
                        concerned in the world scene—our ideals and our goals are for a world of
                        peace. Our ideals and our goals are for a world in which we reduce the
                        burden of arms, and therefore, it is vitally important that this Nation that
                        has that kind of ideals and that kind of goals maintains its strength so
                        that we can play that role.</p>
                    <p>But maintaining the strength alone is not enough. It must be respected. And
                        that means that we must continue to have a policy which commands respect
                        throughout the world. We must continue to insist on adherence to agreements
                        that are made. We must continue to let the world know that while we have no
                        aggressive intentions anyplace in <pb n="62" facs="0093" xml:id="pg_62"/>the
                        world, we will stand by our treaty commitments wherever they are in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>That, you see, is the language of peace rather than the language of bugging
                        out of the world and turning to what people wistfully might think to be a
                        fortress America. But let me tell you, fortress America might have been
                        before World War II a concept that was viable. Today it is ridiculous. We
                        cannot be apart from the world, not when weapons that can destroy us are 30
                        minutes away.</p>
                    <p>And so, we must play this role. And rather than playing it in terms of
                        whining about it and complaining about it, let us do it proudly, because
                        what greater mission could a people have than to say that in these years—the
                        seventies—of 1971–2–3–4–5 and 6, when we reach our 200th birthday, the
                        United States of America played a great role in the world and made the world
                        safer, not only for ourselves but for everybody in the world. That is the
                        stake, that is the challenge we must meet.</p>
                    <p>Today then, I ask for your support, obviously, for a strong national defense.
                        That is like the preacher talking to the choir. But I know, as far as you
                        are concerned, you will be for that, and I hope so many of you will stay in
                        our Armed Forces. We need you.</p>
                    <p>But also, beyond that, I ask for your support in helping to develop the
                        national spirit, the faith that we need in order to meet our
                        responsibilities in the world. You have already contributed enormously to
                        that by your statements on your return, by what you have said, what you have
                        done, and I am sure you can contribute more to it in the future.</p>
                    <p>But the young people of America need to hear the truth. They will believe
                        you. They will believe you, because you have suffered so much for this
                        country and have proved that you will do anything that you can to do what is
                        best for America, not just for yourselves.</p>
                    <p>Because at this particular point, America is the richest country in the
                        world; militarily, it is the strongest and will always have that potential
                        because of its wealth. The only question is whether we face up to our world
                        responsibilities, whether we have the faith, the patriotism, the willingness
                        to lead in this critical period.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, by what you did and what you said on your return, you have helped
                        turn this country around. You have helped reinstill faith where there was
                        doubt before. And for what you have done by your faith, you have built up
                        America’s faith. This Nation and the world will always be in your debt.</p>
                    <p>Those first 4 years in the office were not easy ones for me in the
                        international front, fighting for an adequate defense budget, fighting for a
                        responsible foreign policy, but looking toward the balance of the second 4
                        years, let me say I feel better, because out in this room, I think I have
                        got some allies, and I will appreciate your help.</p>
                    <p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p>The President said a new wave of isolationism had surfaced—in Congress, in
                        labor, and even in some business circles. You men, with an international
                        mission, have to counteract this trend to isolationism. Otherwise our hopes
                        for a more open world will go down the drain. He agreed that we need more
                        flexibility in legislation on expropriation, flexibility for the President
                        and the Administration. But he noted that there were Congressional problems
                        that result from both domestic pressures and from public attitudes in Latin
                        America. The President said that the attitude of some countries in Latin
                        America is to play to the radical groups and to believe that the way to
                        success is to kick the U.S. around publicly. He quoted a politician in the
                        Philippines who once said: “Give the Americans hell—but don’t drive them
                        away.” It is important for Latin American leaders to understand that they
                        can only go so far before they drive us away. The Congress reacts to these
                        things. Many Americans are tired of being kicked around.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> commented: “We
                            have difficulty with Latin America because it is imperative for leaders
                            to make anti-U.S. statements in order to take pro-U.S. measures
                            (Echeverria laughs deeply). So, I understand. But if it goes beyond a
                            certain point, then it turns into a contest between the developed United
                            States and the underdeveloped world. It faces us with a dilemma. It
                            helps create a political structure which freezes a country into a
                            posture against us. And, as I say, this does create a real dilemma. We
                            want independence but also a structure in which we can get along
                            together.” (National Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"

                        real questions are: what do we do about Mexican tomatoes, what do we do
                        about salinity?)</p>
                    <p>A serious problem is those politicians who exploit the radical activists. We
                        must fight this to the extent we can. We must get our friends—in government,
                        in business—to know that this is a dangerous game.</p>
                    <p>(He quoted <persName corresp="#p_LHC2_1">Henry Cabot Lodge</persName> as
                        saying that Latin America was important in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss> and that without them the U.S. position would be weak.) We
                        realize that Latin America is important. But the truth is that they need us
                        more than we need them. He noted that government aid was a small proportion
                        of our total involvement ($16 billion invested). But when you go to Congress
                        to try to get more done, it is rough. And it is getting rougher.</p>
                    <p>The President then reminisced about how much different the situation was
                        today than when he last met with the Council of the Americas Trustees in
                        November 1969. Then, he said, there were 300,000 demonstrators around the
                        White House. We were losing 300 men a week in Vietnam. We were in
                        confrontation with the Russians. We had no contact with China. The situation
                        in Latin America was about the same, maybe a little better. When we see the
                        changes that have taken place, there is no reason for euphoria but there is
                        reason for hope. However, we live in a potentially dangerous world. A basic
                        fact is that with the advent of nuclear weapons, there will be no
                        conventional wars between major powers. Now it will all be done in 30
                        minutes.</p>
                    <p>It is important that we realize what we have done in the world despite the
                        threat of war. The people are pleased with the end of the Vietnam War. Far
                        more important is what we have done to change the world. That is what the
                        China initiative was all about. It was not just handshaking. As President, I
                        could not let one-fourth of the people of the world—with a future as a
                        nuclear power—not have relations with us. We must look down the road 15 to
                        20 years in terms of our commu<pb n="65" facs="0096" xml:id="pg_65"
                        />nications with them. Interestingly enough, the U.S. is China’s best
                        friend.</p>
                    <p>Another thing—the meetings with the Soviet Union in Moscow<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d13fn3">See <ref target="#d7fn4">footnote 4, Document
                            7</ref>.</note> were important. A number of agreements were signed.
                        Overriding all of them was the first step in limiting nuclear arms. Far more
                        important is the fact that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are in a position
                        where we are negotiating. We have to find a way to avoid a nuclear
                        explosion. The important thing is the fact that there is communication. The
                        reason for that communication: the U.S. and Soviets are equal (in power) and
                        China will be equal in 15 years. If a President of the U.S. decides he has
                        to react, it means the death of 70 million Russians and 70 million
                        Americans. “Anyone who sits in this chair has to avoid that happening,” he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>There is a tendency in Congress toward increasing isolationism. They see the
                        end of the war in Vietnam and say “isn’t that nice—let’s cut $10 billion
                        from the Defense budget.” We should not cut the Defense budget at this time
                        because it means changing the game plan which is working. But that is what
                        Congress is doing when it says “regardless of what you do, we are going to
                        cut.” We have to recognize that nothing is done in this field (détente) from
                        love. It is done from respect, even fear. There must be mutual cuts.
                        Otherwise our bargaining position is incredibly weaker. Our allies will lose
                        trust. The Soviets will lose respect. And China will no longer feel that
                        agreements with us are important.</p>
                    <p>We face the stark fact that in a nuclear world we are the only free country
                        that counts. The British and French don’t have the power; the Germans are
                        not allowed to develop nuclear weapons; Japan must not be allowed to develop
                        them. In terms of security of our alliances the power is all right here.
                        Japan is keenly aware that without us, they will (1) have to make a deal
                        with the Soviets or (2) go nuclear.</p>
                    <p>As for Latin America, we care about our closest friends there. Our actions
                        (on other problems) should not be read as meaning we don’t care.</p>
                    <p>This is not true. What we are talking about has great importance for our
                        close friends and neighbors. They have a stake in a peaceful world. Latin
                        America is most important to us. Vitally important in terms of economics. We
                        must do everything we can to reinforce our interest. But we must also let
                        them know that it is to their advantage to work with us. However, we should
                        not infringe on their sensitivities.</p>
                    <p>The major danger spot is the Middle East. There are no easy answers. But we
                        are working on it. It is the most likely area of big power <pb n="66"
                            facs="0097" xml:id="pg_66"/>conflict. The Vietnam war was not that
                        important to Soviet interests. The Middle East is that important. Europe
                        gets 90% of its fuel from the Middle East. Japan gets 80% of its fuel from
                        there.</p>
                    <p>I raise these other parts of the world—not to downgrade Latin America, but to
                        put things in perspective. We must get along with the Soviet Union and with
                        China. We must get along with Europe. Latin America is still important to
                        us, even more important than it was. Your concerns will get our deepest
                        consideration. We need your support, in defense and in total policy. For our
                        friendship with Latin America will not be important if we become the second
                        most powerful nation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">David Rockefeller</persName> said he agreed
                        with everything the President had said. He said that Latin Americans note
                        that we talk of the Five Major Power centers (the U.S., Europe, the Soviet
                        Union, China and Japan). They ask: where are we in that scheme? It is
                        important for us to find ways to assure them of our esteem.</p>
                    <p>Regarding investment, it is big—$16 billion is already at stake. However,
                        private enterprise is under fire there (in Latin America) and in our own
                        Congress. We have a defensive battle of our own. It is all the more
                        important for us to find ways for our role to be constructive. We need a
                        more organized role with the U.S. Government and Latin governments. The
                        Council’s proposed idea of an advisory council could contribute toward
                        this.</p>
                    <p>The President said he did not want to end the meeting on a downbeat note.
                        There are always many danger spots. The world, in terms of the long view, is
                        a safer place than it was four years ago. It is not in the nature of men to
                        love one another; but that doesn’t mean they need to fight one another. My
                        greatest goal in the next four years is to make the world even more safe
                        than it is now. </p>
                    <p>Toasts and speeches are all froth. “We need to get more body to this beer.”
                        We cannot bug out on our responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded the meeting by thanking the members of the Council
                        for their advice and their time. He walked around the Cabinet table and
                        shook hands personally with each of the Trustees. The meeting concluded at
                        12:30 p.m.</p>

                        essential that those two nations, where possible, work together. And the key

                        has been to set up what the President has called a structure of peace, by
                        which we mean an international system less geared to the management of
                        crises, less conscious of constant eruptions of conflict, in which the

                        structure of peace of which the President has been speaking and can be seen
                        as a step toward a new era of cooperation in the relations of all nations
                        and of lifting from them increasingly the fear of nuclear war and of war in
                        general.” (Ibid., page 142)</p>
                    <p>In response to multiple queries as to the viability of such an agreement,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> stated:</p>

                    <p>“If either of the two signatories wants to find an excuse to go to war, it
                        will find an excuse to go to war. This has been the history of the postwar
                        period. We are talking here of restraint on significant military actions;
                        and what endangers international peace and security is not determined by the
                        unilateral declaration of the country going to war but also by the reactions
                        of other members of the international system, because this is what produces
                        the threat to international peace and security.” (Ibid., page 144)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, during his final summit
                        press conference in San Clemente on June 25, responded to comments
                        intimating that the nuclear war agreement was nonbinding and not
                        self-enforcing. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                        underscored the reality that a successful agreement depended upon the
                        willingness of both parties to observe and enforce the terms, asserting:</p>
                    <p>“This agreement is no different from any other agreement in that respect.
                        When great powers make an agreement with each other, they of course have the
                        capability of not observing it unless the other side is prepared to draw
                        extreme consequences. But the violation of this agreement would have serious
                        consequences for the whole context of U.S.-Soviet relations, and conversely
                        the observance of this agreement can mark, as I said on Friday [June 22], a
                        milestone in the achievement of self-restraint by the major countries, a
                        self-restraint which is by definition the essence of peace and which we
                        intend to observe, which we expect the Soviet Union to observe, and which
                        can therefore provide the foundation for a new international
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>“Of course history is replete with changes of course and we must be vigilant
                        and prepared for such an occurrence; but it is the belief of the President
                        that this period has a unique opportunity to create a new and more peaceful
                        system. It is an opportunity that has come about partly as a result of the
                        enormity of the weapons that would be used in case of a conflict, partly by
                        the depth of human aspiration toward peace, partly as a result of the
                        complexities of a world in which the ideological expectations of any side
                        have not been fully met.</p>
                    <p>“But whatever the reasons, we consider the summit as a further advance along
                        that road, that as these meetings become a regular feature of international
                        life and as we come to take them more and more for granted, the results will
                        follow paths that will come to seem more and more natural, and we would
                        consider that one of the best signs that a peaceful world is coming into
                        being.” (Ibid., page 149)</p>

                        <note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">Syndicated newspaper columnist.</note> writes
                        implying that not everything the Board does goes to the President. Every
                        report of the Board does go to the President. Don’t judge your influence by
                        the frequency of meeting with us.</p>
                    <p>I think what is going on is an unmitigated disaster in foreign policy. In
                        April our foreign policy was in excellent shape. The Chinese-Soviet triangle
                        was operating for us. Everyone wanted to be associated with us. Now people
                        are holding off. It is nothing bad yet, but sometimes someone will make a
                        run at us. We have established a reputation for hard and unpredictable
                        action.</p>
                    <p>There are two choices—use force or don’t. If we use it, use enough to
                        succeed. In the India crisis, we moved things—carriers—around so people
                        would say “If they do this over Bangladesh, what would they do over the
                        Middle East?”</p>
                    <p>In 1970 we were to the brink of war over Jordan without a complaint from
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>It’s in this way that Watergate is a disaster. Everything is a little harder
                        now and takes a little longer now—Europe, China, etc. All but the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. It is a national obligation to get
                        Watergate behind us so we can be seen as an operating government. Nothing
                        yet has really gone wrong—I am talking about the potential.</p>
                    <p>We must get over Watergate. I speak without prejudice to the facts of it.</p>
                    <p>Internationally, the big fact is the Sino-Soviet involvement. We have so far
                        pushed the Chinese as a sentimental thing, but let’s not kid ourselves:
                        China wants us as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. It is a pleasure to
                        do business with them. They are tough, they’re our best <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> ally! But if they think we are going
                        through our cultural revolution, they won’t even run the ideological risk of
                        being tied up with us. They are not sentimental.</p>
                    <pb n="70" facs="0101" xml:id="pg_70"/>
                    <p>A successful Soviet attack on China would overturn the world balance of
                        power. If it is a disarming attack to which we don’t respond, if they couple
                        it with seizing Manchuria, the effect on Europe and Japan would be
                        disastrous. We will try to avert this.</p>
                    <p>It is alleged we have antagonized Japan by neglect, etc. It would be easy if
                        that were so, because we could correct it. They are hard to deal with. They
                        leak everything. You must assume that a country which (through intelligence)
                        fears the most diabolical things of others, must be capable of diabolical
                        things themselves. The Japanese are a potentially corrosive role
                        internationally. Take energy. They are international scavengers. It is
                        narrow, cold-blooded, etc. But they are tuned to survival, so as long as the
                        international structure is favorable, they are okay. Only if things go wrong
                        will they desert.</p>
                    <p>Europe: They accuse us of condominium, of hegemony, of weakening the
                        deterrent, of asking for their buildup.</p>
                    <p>The danger is that relations with adversaries become easy and those with
                        friends acrimonious.</p>
                    <p>Also the emergence of the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> is creating some
                        problems. There is a danger they’ll push themselves into confrontation with
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Middle East: Israel is so much stronger that the dilemma is on the Arabs.
                        Right now Israel is asking for their immediate surrender, and the Arabs are
                        asking for a miracle. We want to help, but we will not put out a plan for
                        both to shoot at. We are trying to get both sides, or one side, to put out
                        something which will get negotiations going.</p>

                    <p>“In the first term of the President, many important and some revolutionary
                        changes were made. These required, to considerable extent, secret diplomacy,
                        and they were conducted on a rather restricted basis. But now we are in a
                        different phase. The foundations that have been laid must now lead to the
                        building of a more permanent structure. What has been started is still very
                        tender.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary-designate intended to capitalize upon these
                        accomplishments:</p>
                    <p>“So what we are going to try to do is to solidify what has been started, to
                        put more emphasis on our relationship with Europe and with Japan, and to
                        conclude during the term of the President the building of a structure that

                    <p>Following the August congressional recess, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> testified before the Senate Foreign Relations
                        Committee September 7–17. The confirmation hearings were chaired by Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">J. William Fulbright</persName>
                        (D–Arkansas) and were dominated by questions about illegal wiretapping. In
                        his opening remarks, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                        underscored the interconnectedness between foreign and domestic policy:</p>
                    <p>“Mr. Chairman, we have come to experience in recent years that peace at home
                        and peace abroad are closely related. How well we perform in foreign policy
                        depends importantly on how purposeful we are at home. America has passed
                        through a decade of domestic turbulence which has deepened divisions and
                        even shaken our national self-confidence in some measure. At the same time,
                        profound changes have occurred in the world around us a generation after
                        World War II. Our era is marked by both the anxieties of a transitional
                        period and the opportunities of fresh creation.</p>
                    <p>“These challenges, though they appear as practical issues, cannot be solved
                        in technical terms; they closely reflect our view of ourselves. They require
                        a sense of identity and purpose as much as a sense of policy. Throughout our
                        history we have thought of what we did as growing out of deeper moral
                        values. America was not true to itself unless it had a meaning beyond
                        itself. In this spiritual sense, America was never isolationist.</p>
                    <p>“This must remain our attitude.” (Ibid., October 1, 1973, page 425)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> then asserted that greater
                        domestic consensus would allow the United States to project an image of
                        “steadiness.” Cooperation among the three branches of government and a new
                        partnership between the American public and the Federal government informed
                        the administration’s new approach. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> concluded his statement by remarking:</p>
                    <p>“A few years before he died, one of our most distinguished Secretaries of
                        State, <persName corresp="#p_AD_1">Dean Acheson</persName>, entitled his
                        memoirs ‘Present at the Creation.’ He chose that title because he was one of
                        the leading participants in the creation of the postwar international
                        system. The challenge before our country now is whether our generation has
                        the vision—as <persName corresp="#p_AD_1">Dean Acheson</persName>’s did more
                        than two decades ago—to turn into dynamic reality the hopeful beginnings we
                        have made toward a more durable peace and a more benevolent planet.” (Ibid.,
                        page 428)</p>
                    <p>The Senate confirmed <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> on
                        September 21 by a 78–7 vote. Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWE_1">Warren E. Burger</persName> administered
                        the oath of office to <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> at

                    <p rend="center">A Just Consensus, A Stable Order, A Durable Peace</p>
                    <p>I come before you today—confirmed in office but two days ago—as probably the
                        world’s most junior Foreign Minister. That President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> should ask me as my first official
                        act to speak here for the United States reaffirms the importance that my
                        country attaches to the values and ideals of the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>It would be idle to deny that the American people, like many others, have
                        sometimes been disappointed because this organization has not been more
                        successful in translating the hopes for universal peace of its architects
                        into concrete accomplishments.</p>
                    <p>But despite our disappointments, my country remains committed to the goal of
                        a world community. We will continue to work in this Parliament of Man to
                        make it a reality.</p>
                    <p>Two centuries ago, the philosopher Kant predicted that perpetual peace would
                        come eventually—either as the creation of man’s moral aspirations or as the
                        consequence of physical necessity. What seemed utopian then looms as
                        tomorrow’s reality; soon there will be no alternative. Our only choice is
                        whether the world envisaged in the charter will come about as the result of
                        our vision or of a catastrophe invited by our shortsightedness.</p>
                    <p>The United States has made its choice. My country seeks true peace, not
                        simply an armistice. We strive for a world in which the rule of law governs
                        and fundamental human rights are the birthright of all. Beyond the bilateral
                        diplomacy, the pragmatic agreements, and dra<pb n="74" facs="0105"
                            xml:id="pg_74"/>matic steps of recent years, we envisage a
                        comprehensive, institutionalized peace—a peace which this organization is
                        uniquely situated to foster and to anchor in the hearts of men.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d17fn2">During remarks made at a September 26 news conference in
                            New York, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> clarified
                            the nature of the administration’s global strategy: “So for the
                            President’s second term, our agenda is to try to create an international
                            consensus to international order that is seen to be just by all or at
                            least the greatest number—something that embodies humane and progressive
                            ideas.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, October
                            15, 1973, p. 475)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>This will be the spirit of American foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>This attitude will guide our work in this organization.</p>
                    <p>We start from a bedrock of solid progress. Many of the crises that haunted
                        past General Assemblies have been put behind us. Agreement has been reached
                        on Berlin; there is a cease-fire in the Middle East; the Viet-Nam war has
                        been ended. The rigid confrontation that has dominated international life
                        and weakened this organization for a quarter of a century has been
                        softened.</p>
                    <p>The United States and the Soviet Union have perceived a commonality of
                        interest in avoiding nuclear holocaust and in establishing a broad web of
                        constructive relationships. Talks on strategic arms limitation have already
                        produced historic accords aimed at slowing the arms race and insuring
                        strategic stability; we have, today, resumed negotiations on this subject.
                        The positive results we hope for will enhance the security of all
                        mankind.</p>
                    <p>Two decades of estrangement between the United States and the People’s
                        Republic of China have given way to constructive dialogue and productive
                        exchanges. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> has met
                        with the leaders of that nation; we have agreed to a historic communiqué
                        that honestly sets forth both our differences and our common
                            principles;<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">See <ref target="#d3fn5">footnote
                                5, Document 3</ref>.</note> and we have each opened a Liaison Office
                        in the capital of the other.</p>
                    <p>Many other countries have seized the initiative and contributed—in substance
                        and spirit—to the relaxation of tensions. The nations of Europe and North
                        America are engaged in a conference to further security and cooperation. The
                        two German states have taken their place in this Assembly. India, Pakistan,
                        and Bangladesh have begun to move toward a welcome reconciliation. North and
                        South Korea are at last engaged in a dialogue which we hope will lead to a
                        new era of peace and security.</p>
                    <p>Yet these achievements, solid as they are, have only made less precarious the
                        dangers and divisions inherited from the postwar era. We have ended many of
                        the confrontations of the cold war; yet, even in this room, the vocabulary
                        of suspicion persists. Relaxation of tensions is justified by some as merely
                        a tactical interlude before renewed <pb n="75" facs="0106" xml:id="pg_75"
                        />struggle. Others suspect the emergence of a two-power condominium. And as
                        tension between the two original blocs has eased, a third grouping
                        increasingly assumes the characteristics of a bloc of its own—the alignment
                        of the non-aligned.</p>
                    <p>So the world is uneasily suspended between old slogans and new realities,
                        between a view of peace as but a pause in an unending struggle and a vision
                        of peace as a promise of global cooperation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">From Détente to Cooperation</p>
                    <p>In 1946 <persName corresp="#p_BJ_2">James Byrnes</persName>, the first
                        Secretary of State to address this Assembly, spoke of how the United Nations
                        could help break down habits of thinking in national isolation and move
                        toward universal understanding and tolerance among all peoples.</p>
                    <p>The United States will never be satisfied with a world of uneasy truces, of
                        offsetting blocs, of accommodations of convenience. We know that power can
                        enforce a resigned passivity, but only a sense of justice can enlist
                        consensus. We strive for a peace whose stability rests not merely on a
                        balance of forces, but on shared aspirations. We are convinced that a
                        structure which ignores humane values will prove cold and empty and
                        unfulfilling to most of mankind.</p>
                    <p>The United States deeply believes:</p>
                    <p>—That justice cannot be confined by national frontiers.</p>
                    <p>—That truth is universal and not the peculiar possession of a single people
                        or group or ideology.</p>
                    <p>—That compassion and humanity must ennoble all our endeavors.</p>
                    <p>In this spirit we ask the Assembly to move with us from détente to
                        cooperation, from coexistence to community.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Moving Toward Greater Stability</p>
                    <p>Our journey must begin with the world as it is and with the issues now before
                        us. The United States will spare no effort to ease tensions further and to
                        move toward greater stability:</p>
                    <p>—We shall continue, in the spirit of the Shanghai communiqué, our search for
                        a new relationship with the People’s Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>—We shall work to promote positive trends elsewhere in Asia. The uncertain
                        peace in Indochina must be strengthened; the world community cannot afford,
                        or permit, a relapse into war in that region.</p>
                    <p>—We shall continue to pursue vigorously the building of constructive
                        relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>—We shall strive to promote conciliation in Europe. In the negotiations
                        beginning next month we shall seek a reduction of the military forces that
                        have faced each other for so long across that divided continent.</p>
                    <pb n="76" facs="0107" xml:id="pg_76"/>
                    <p>—We shall give new vigor to our policy of partnership in the Western
                        Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>—We shall honor our pledge to promote self-determination, economic
                        development, and human dignity across the continent of Africa.</p>
                    <p>—We shall press on with strategic arms limitation talks. We consider them
                        crucial for security and stability in this period.</p>
                    <p>—We shall search for solutions to the worldwide problem of conventional
                        weapons, which drain our resources and fuel the fires of local conflict.</p>
                    <p>In these efforts, the United States will be guided by fundamental
                        principles:</p>
                    <p>—We have no desire for domination. We will oppose—as we have consistently
                        opposed throughout this century—any nation that chooses this path. We have
                        not been asked to participate in a condominium; we would reject such an
                        appeal if it were made.</p>
                    <p>—We will never abandon our allies or our friends. The strengthening of our
                        traditional ties is the essential foundation for the development of new
                        relationships with old adversaries.</p>
                    <p>—We will work for peace through the United Nations as well as through
                        bilateral relationships.</p>
                    <p>We recognize our special obligation, as a permanent member of the Security
                        Council, to assist in the search for just solutions in those parts of the
                        world now torn by strife, such as the Middle East. While we cannot
                        substitute for the efforts of those most directly involved, we are prepared
                        to use our influence to generate a spirit of accommodation and to encourage
                        the parties toward practical progress.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Quality of Life</p>
                    <p>But progress on the traditional agenda is not enough. The more we succeed in
                        solving political problems, the more other and perhaps deeper challenges
                        emerge. As the world grows more stable, we must confront the question of the
                        ends of détente. As the threat of war recedes, the problem of the quality of
                        life takes on more urgent significance.</p>
                    <p>We are, in fact, members of a community drawn by modern science, technology,
                        and new forms of communication into a proximity for which we are still
                        politically unprepared. Technology daily outstrips the ability of our
                        institutions to cope with its fruits. Our political imagination must catch
                        up with our scientific vision. This is at the same time the greatest
                        challenge and the greatest opportunity of this organization:</p>
                    <p>—The pollution of the skies, the seas, and the land is a global problem.</p>
                    <pb n="77" facs="0108" xml:id="pg_77"/>
                    <p>—The increased consumption of cereals and protein has reduced world food
                        reserves to dangerously low levels.</p>
                    <p>—The demand for energy is outrunning supply, and the need for technological
                        innovation is urgent.</p>
                    <p>—The growth of the world’s economy is inhibited by restrictive trading blocs
                        and an insufficiently flexible international monetary system.</p>
                    <p>—The exploitation of the resources of the ocean beds, which is essential for
                        the needs of burgeoning populations, requires global cooperation lest it
                        degenerate into global contention.</p>
                    <p>Challenges of this magnitude cannot be solved by a world fragmented into
                        self-contained nation-states or rigid blocs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Areas of Common Action</p>
                    <p>I do not intend today to cover the whole agenda of international cooperation.
                        Rather, I shall speak briefly of some illustrative areas of common action. I
                        pledge the readiness of the United States to solve these problems
                        cooperatively and to submit proposals aimed at their resolution.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">A world community requires the curbing of conflict.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The United Nations, in its 28-year history, has not always been idle in this
                        sphere. In Indonesia, the Indian Subcontinent, the Middle East, the Congo,
                        and in Cyprus, it has shown its ability for effective factfinding,
                        mediation, and peacekeeping missions. This central aspect of the U.N.’s work
                        must be strengthened. On a small planet, so bound together by technology and
                        so interdependent economically, we can no longer afford the constant
                        eruption of conflict and the danger of its spread.</p>
                    <p>Yet, in recent years we have found ourselves locked in fruitless debates
                        about the inauguration of peacekeeping operations and over the degree of
                        control the Security Council would exercise over peacekeeping machinery—an
                        impasse which insured only that permanent peacekeeping machinery would not
                        come into being. Each peacekeeping unit we have formed to cope with an
                        emergency has been an improvisation growing out of argument and
                        controversy.</p>
                    <p>We should delay no longer. The time has come to agree on peacekeeping
                        guidelines so that this organization can act swiftly, confidently, and
                        effectively in future crises. To break the deadlock, the United States is
                        prepared to consider how the Security Council can play a more central role
                        in the conduct of peacekeeping operations. If all countries concerned
                        approach this problem with a desire to achieve a cooperative solution, the
                        United Nations can achieve a major step forward during this session.</p>

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">A world community must have the widest possible
                            membership.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The exclusion of any qualified state denies representation not only to
                        governments but to peoples. Membership in this body should be a step toward
                        reconciliation, not a source of conflict. The time has come for North and
                        South Korea to be offered their rightful places here, without prejudice to a
                        future evolution toward unification.</p>
                    <p>In this spirit also, we support the permanent membership of Japan in the
                        Security Council.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The growing threat to the world’s food supply deserves the urgent attention
                        of this Assembly. Since 1969, global consumption of cereals has risen more
                        rapidly than production; stocks are at the lowest levels in years. We now
                        face the prospect that—even with bumper crops—the world may not rebuild its
                        seriously depleted reserves in this decade.</p>
                    <p>No one country can cope with this problem. The United States therefore
                        proposes:</p>
                    <p>—That a World Food Conference be organized under United Nations auspices in
                            1974<note n="4" xml:id="d17fn4">The World Food Conference was held in
                            Rome November 5–16, 1974. See <ref target="#d47">Document
                            47</ref>.</note> to discuss ways to maintain adequate food supplies, and
                        to harness the efforts of all nations to meet the hunger and malnutrition
                        resulting from natural disasters.</p>
                    <p>—That nations in a position to do so offer technical assistance in the
                        conservation of food. The United States is ready to join with others in
                        providing such assistance.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">A world community cannot remain divided between the
                            permanently rich and the permanently poor.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Let us therefore resolve that this Assembly, this year, initiate a
                        search—drawing on the world’s best minds—for new and imaginative solutions
                        to the problems of development. Our search must be candid and realistic, but
                        it must also be free of peremptory demands, antagonistic propositions,
                        ideological confrontation, or propagandistic rhetoric—or we will surely
                        fail.</p>
                    <p>The United States is prepared to join in this new search, providing freely of
                        the experience gained over two decades. We have learned not to exaggerate
                        our capacity to transform nations—but we have also learned much about what
                        progress is possible.</p>
                    <p>We will participate without preconditions, with a conciliatory attitude and a
                        cooperative commitment. We ask only that others adopt the same approach.</p>
                    <pb n="79" facs="0110" xml:id="pg_79"/>
                    <p>In this spirit the United States is willing to examine seriously the proposal
                        by the distinguished President of Mexico for a Charter of the Economic
                        Rights and Duties of States.<note n="5" xml:id="d17fn5">
                            <persName corresp="#p_EL_1">Echeverría</persName> first proposed the

                            273–274.</note> Such a document will make a significant and historic
                        contribution if it reflects the true aspirations of all nations; if it is
                        turned into an indictment of one group of countries by another, it will
                        accomplish nothing. To command general support—and to be implemented—the
                        proposed rights and duties must be defined equitably and take into account
                        the concerns of industrialized as well as of developing countries. The
                        United States stands ready to define its responsibilities in a humane and
                        cooperative spirit.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Finally, a world community must harness science and
                            technology for the benefit of all.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>We must begin to match our remarkable technological skills with our equally
                        remarkable technological needs. We must find the means for the cooperative
                        and judicious development of our energy resources. We must responsibly
                        confront the problems of population growth, which are fast pushing humanity
                        toward the limits of what our earth can sustain. We must embark on a new
                        scientific revolution to increase agricultural productivity in all lands. No
                        field of human endeavor is so dependent upon an open world for its
                        advancement; no field is so in need of international cooperation to cope
                        with its potential dangers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, fellow delegates: Are we prepared to accept the imperatives of
                        a global society and infuse our labors with a new vision? Or shall we
                        content ourselves with a temporary pause in the turmoil that has wracked our
                        century? Shall we proceed with one-sided demands and sterile confrontations?
                        Or shall we proceed in a spirit of compromise produced by a sense of common
                        destiny? We must move from hesitant cooperation born of necessity to genuine
                        collective effort based on common purpose.</p>
                    <p>It is a choice no country can make alone. We can repeat old slogans or strive
                        for new hope. We can fill the record of our proceedings with acrimony, or we
                        can dedicate ourselves to dealing with man’s deepest needs. The ideal of a
                        world community may be decried as unrealistic—but great constructions have
                        always been ideals before they can become realities. Let us dedicate
                        ourselves to this noblest of all possible goals and achieve at last what has
                        so long eluded us: true understanding and tolerance among mankind.</p>

                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">The Historical and Present Concept: Pan Americanism</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The concept of Pan Americanism has guided U.S. policy towards the countries
                        of Latin America for over a century. The notion has been of a community of
                        republics, with a common history—a struggle to be independent of Europe—and
                        a common ideal—representative democracy—which would cooperate to build a new
                        order in the Western Hemisphere. Until recently this conceptual framework
                        served us and the Latin Americans well. It provided a philosophical
                        rationale as well as a juridical basis for what was in fact a hegemonic
                        power system with the U.S. at its head.</p>
                    <p>By and large the Latin Americans acquiesced in having the United States shape
                        the Inter-American System. This attitude reflected their own weakness, but
                        also their perception that it was in their interests to have the United
                        States bound to them in a formal system in which they could attempt to
                        inhibit the unilateral use of U.S. power or turn it to their own
                        advantage.</p>
                    <p>Today we are in a very different world, and the changes have combined to
                        render an Inter-American System led by and dependent upon the United States
                        unacceptable to Latin America and, indeed, to us as well.</p>
                    <p>While this situation was recognized as early as 1969, we have thus far been
                        unable to establish a satisfactory new kind of relationship to replace the
                        old one. The result in the multilateral framework has been to create a
                        vacuum which some Latin American regimes highly critical of U.S. policy have
                        exploited.</p>
                    <pb n="81" facs="0112" xml:id="pg_81"/>
                    <p>The sharp deterioration in multilateral relations has not been paralleled in
                        the bilateral area, our bilateral relations with the majority of Latin
                        American countries being quite satisfactory. Nevertheless, the two kinds of
                        relationship—multilateral and bilateral—obviously interact. The
                        Inter-American System provides individual Latin American states with a
                        sounding board for their attacks on us in the case of bilateral conflict.
                        Otherwise friendly states are forced to take sides. The present multilateral
                        relationship also is a vehicle for all the states in the region to press for
                        non-reciprocal U.S. concessions which they could not expect to obtain in a
                        bilateral context.</p>
                    <p>If we continue to operate with the old multilateral relationship, however,
                        our bilateral relations will suffer. We will be increasingly subjected to a
                        multilateralization of bilateral grievances. We will be increasingly
                        embarrassed because our rhetoric about Pan Americanism will be belied by
                        reality. Failing to see any response to their demands for unilateral U.S.
                        concessions, the Latin Americans will be encouraged to unite around extreme
                        Third-World positions in global forums and to participate in economic
                        arrangements inimical to our interests. We will be unable to manage our
                        bilateral relations in isolation from these multilateral developments, and
                        the result will be a spreading political alienation of the countries of the
                        Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">The Main Outlines of a New Conceptual Approach</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Latin America and the United States must draw back from their outmoded
                        relationship in order to lay the basis for a more realistic interlocking
                        once the region is stronger and more highly developed.</p>
                    <p>The shift from a bipolar to a multipolar world can only be transitional as
                        political structures must eventually be adapted to the growing
                        interdependence of nations. In the meantime, states which by themselves are
                        unable to compete with the great powers—the two military superpowers plus
                        China and Japan—must seek to form blocs with other states in a similar
                        position and with whom they have ties of culture, history, or geography.</p>
                    <p>Farthest along in Europe, the regional bloc concept is taking hold in Latin
                        America as well. The Latins’ attempt in the 1960s to slavishly imitate
                        Europe and form a common market failed to fulfill the high hopes held out
                        for it because the economies of the area were too fragile and were
                        competitive rather than complementary.</p>
                    <p>More modest attempts at regional collaboration have been more successful.
                        Subregional efforts at economic union, such as the Andean Pact, the Central
                        American Common Market, and the Caribbean Free Trade Area, have been able to
                        make progress. Perhaps as significant in the long run, the Latins have shown
                        themselves increasingly capable of acting in unison in international
                        politics. The Latin American bloc in international forums is now a regular
                        fixture. The Latins’ custom of cau<pb n="82" facs="0113" xml:id="pg_82"
                        />cusing to form a common front vis-à-vis the United States has been
                        institutionalized in <gloss target="#t_CECLA_1">CECLA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The United States attitude toward Latin American regionalism has been
                        ambivalent. We have given economic assistance to the subregional economic
                        groupings. On the other hand, we have expressed misgivings about Latin
                        American political collaboration—e.g., <gloss target="#t_CECLA_1"
                            >CECLA</gloss>—because it has been so obviously designed to strengthen
                        the Latins’ hands in dealing with us. We have opposed proposals that a Latin
                        American bloc be institutionalized in the Inter-American System.</p>
                    <p>If we accept the proposition, however, that some such “dumbbell”—always
                        latent in the U.S.-Latin American relationship—is inevitable and, indeed,
                        responds to the deep psychological need of the Latin nations to assert their
                        independence of the U.S., we might wish to make a virtue of necessity.
                        Regionalism of Latin America, and sub-regionalism within Latin America,
                        could serve as the new conceptual basis for relations in the Western
                        Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>This “new regionalism” would differ from the old regionalism—Pan
                        Americanism—in that the United States would stand somewhat apart from
                        it—supporting it when possible, dealing with it in a new juridical
                        framework, differing with it on specific issues—but not as a participant on
                        an equal footing with all of the other countries. There would be “linkage”
                        but not 100% membership. The new relationship would not be unlike the one we
                        are seeking to establish with Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>Such a conceptual framework should afford the United States a number of
                        advantages:</p>
                    <p>1. The present de facto situation in which confrontations between the United
                        States and the Latin American nations stem from a different perception of
                        interests would be rationalized—would become in a sense de jure. While we
                        would be confronted, as we now are, with a regional, Latin American position
                        on a number of issues, it would be understood that neither we nor the Latin
                        Americans had the obligation to conform our policies. There would be less
                        grounds for recrimination that we were not living up to our obligations
                        under Pan Americanism.</p>
                    <p>2. We would gain greater flexibility in the conduct of our relations with the
                        rest of the Hemisphere. We would have less inhibitions about discriminating
                        among the nations of the Hemisphere on the basis of their relative size,
                        development, proximity, and interests. Instead of striving to achieve one
                        lowest-common-denominator type policy for “Latin America”, we would have a
                        more realistic web of policies—bilateral, sub-regional, and regional.</p>
                    <p>3. We would have a firmer basis for demanding greater reciprocity in our
                        relationships with the other nations of the Hemisphere. It should be clearer
                        that an end to the hegemony and paternalism that was associated with Pan
                        Americanism also means the end to a system in which <pb n="83" facs="0114"
                            xml:id="pg_83"/>only the United States had “obligations” and
                        “commitments” and all the others had “rights.”</p>
                    <p>In the long run, such a system should strengthen the nations of Latin America
                        and the Caribbean by fostering self-reliance and a sense of a destiny.
                        Before the end of this century we should see another regional center of
                        political and economic strength in the world, one with which, like Europe,
                        we would deal as equals and have close political and economic ties, and
                        which would be a constructive force for world order.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Moral Purposes and Policy Choices</p>
                    <p>This is an important anniversary. A year ago today, on October 8, came the
                        breakthrough in the Paris negotiations which led soon afterward to the end
                        of American military involvement in Viet-Nam. It is strangely difficult now
                        to recapture the emotion of that moment of hope and uncertainty when
                        suddenly years of suffering and division were giving way to new
                        possibilities for reconciliation.</p>
                    <p>We meet, too, at a time when renewed conflict in the Middle East<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d19fn2">On October 6, fighting broke out in the Middle East.
                            Egyptian and Syrian forces mounted a surprise attack against Israel by
                            crossing the cease-fire lines into the Sinai Peninsula and Golan
                            Heights, areas held by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.</note>
                        reminds us that international stability is always precarious and never to be
                        taken for granted. Pacem in Terris remains regrettably elusive. However well
                        we contain this crisis, as we have contained others, we must still ask
                        ourselves what we seek beyond the management of conflict.</p>
                    <p>The need for a dialogue about national purposes has never been more urgent,
                        and no assembly is better suited for such a discussion than those gathered
                        here tonight.</p>
                    <pb n="84" facs="0115" xml:id="pg_84"/>
                    <p>Dramatic changes in recent years have transformed America’s position and role
                        in the world:</p>
                    <p>—For most of the postwar period America enjoyed predominance in physical
                        resources and political power. Now, like most other nations in history, we
                        find that our most difficult task is how to apply limited means to the
                        accomplishment of carefully defined ends. We can no longer overwhelm our
                        problems; we must master them with imagination, understanding, and
                        patience.</p>
                    <p>—For a generation our preoccupation was to prevent the cold war from
                        degenerating into a hot war. Today, when the danger of global conflict has
                        diminished, we face the more profound problem of defining what we mean by
                        peace and determining the ultimate purpose of improved international
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>—For two decades the solidarity of our alliances seemed as constant as the
                        threats to our security. Now our allies have regained strength and
                        self-confidence, and relations with adversaries have improved. All this has
                        given rise to uncertainties over the sharing of burdens with friends and the
                        impact of reduced tensions on the cohesion of alliances.</p>
                    <p>—Thus, even as we have mastered the art of containing crises, our concern
                        with the nature of a more permanent international order has grown. Questions
                        once obscured by more insistent needs now demand our attention: What is true
                        national interest? To what end stability? What is the relationship of peace
                        to justice?</p>
                    <p>It is characteristic of periods of upheaval that to those who live through
                        them they appear as a series of haphazard events. Symptoms obscure basic
                        issues and historical trends. The urgent tends to dominate the important.
                        Too often goals are presented as abstract utopias, safe havens from pressing
                        events.</p>
                    <p>But a debate, to be fruitful, must define what can reasonably be asked of
                        foreign policy and at what pace progress can be achieved. Otherwise it turns
                        into competing catalogues of the desirable rather than informed comparisons
                        of the possible. Dialogue degenerates into tactical skirmishing.</p>
                    <p>The current public discussion reflects some interesting and significant
                        shifts in perspective:</p>
                    <p>—A foreign policy once considered excessively moralistic is now looked upon
                        by some as excessively pragmatic.</p>
                    <p>—The government was criticized in 1969 for holding back East-West trade with
                        certain countries until there was progress in their foreign policies. Now we
                        are criticized for not holding back East-West trade until there are changes
                        in those same countries’ domestic policies.</p>
                    <pb n="85" facs="0116" xml:id="pg_85"/>
                    <p>—The administration’s foreign policy, once decried as too cold war oriented,
                        is now attacked as too insensitive to the profound moral antagonism between
                        communism and freedom.</p>
                    <p>One consequence of this intellectual shift is a gap between conception and
                        performance on some major issues of policy:</p>
                    <p>—The desirability of peace and détente is affirmed, but both the inducements
                        to progress and the penalties to confrontation are restricted by
                        legislation.</p>
                    <p>—Expressions of concern for human values in other countries are coupled with
                        failure to support the very programs designed to help developing areas
                        improve their economic and social conditions.</p>
                    <p>—The declared objective of maintaining a responsible American international
                        role clashes with nationalistic pressures in trade and monetary negotiations
                        and with calls for unilateral withdrawal from alliance obligations.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that we face genuine moral dilemmas and important policy choices.
                        But it is also clear that we need to define the framework of our dialogue
                        more perceptively and understandingly.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Competing Elements of Foreign Policy</p>
                    <p>Foreign policy must begin with the understanding that it involves
                        relationships between sovereign countries. Sovereignty has been defined as a
                        will uncontrolled by others; that is what gives foreign policy its
                        contingent and ever-incomplete character.</p>
                    <p>For disagreements among sovereign states can be settled only by negotiation
                        or by power, by compromise or by imposition. Which of these methods prevails
                        depends on the values, the strengths, and the domestic systems of the
                        countries involved. A nation’s values define what is just; its strength
                        determines what is possible; its domestic structure decides what policies
                        can in fact be implemented and sustained.</p>
                    <p>Thus foreign policy involves two partially conflicting endeavors: defining
                        the interests, purposes, and values of a society and relating them to the
                        interests, purposes, and values of others.</p>
                    <p>The policymaker therefore must strike a balance between what is desirable and
                        what is possible. Progress will always be measured in partial steps and in
                        the relative satisfaction of alternative goals. Tension is unavoidable
                        between values, which are invariably cast in maximum terms, and efforts to
                        promote them, which of necessity involve compromise. Foreign policy is
                        explained domestically in terms of justice. But what is defined as justice
                        at home becomes the subject of negotiation abroad. It is thus no accident
                        that many nations, including our own, view the international arena as a
                        forum in which virtue is thwarted by the clever practice of foreigners.</p>
                    <pb n="86" facs="0117" xml:id="pg_86"/>
                    <p>In a community of sovereign states, the quest for peace involves a paradox:
                        The attempt to impose absolute justice by one side will be seen as absolute
                        injustice by all others; the quest for total security for some turns into
                        total insecurity for the remainder. Stability depends on the relative
                        satisfaction and therefore also the relative dissatisfaction of the various
                        states. The pursuit of peace must therefore begin with the pragmatic concept
                        of coexistence—especially in a period of ideological conflict.</p>
                    <p>We must, of course, avoid becoming obsessed with stability. An excessively
                        pragmatic policy will be empty of vision and humanity. It will lack not only
                        direction but also roots and heart. General de Gaulle wrote in his memoirs
                        that “France cannot be France without greatness.” By the same token, America
                        cannot be true to itself without moral purpose. This country has always had
                        a sense of mission. Americans have always held the view that America stood
                        for something above and beyond its material achievements. A purely pragmatic
                        policy provides no criteria for other nations to assess our performance and
                        no standards to which the American people can rally.</p>
                    <p>But when policy becomes excessively moralistic it may turn quixotic or
                        dangerous. A presumed monopoly on truth obstructs negotiation and
                        accommodation. Good results may be given up in the quest for ever-elusive
                        ideal solutions. Policy may fall prey to ineffectual posturing or
                        adventuristic crusades.</p>
                    <p>The prerequisite for a fruitful national debate is that the policymakers and
                        critics appreciate each other’s perspectives and respect each other’s
                        purposes. The policymaker must understand that the critic is obliged to
                        stress imperfections in order to challenge assumptions and to goad actions.
                        But equally the critic should acknowledge the complexity and inherent
                        ambiguity of the policymaker’s choices. The policymaker must be concerned
                        with the best that can be achieved, not just the best that can be imagined.
                        He has to act in a fog of incomplete knowledge without the information that
                        will be available later to the analyst. He knows—or should know—that he is
                        responsible for the consequences of disaster as well as for the benefits of
                        success. He may have to qualify some goals, not because they would be
                        undesirable if reached but because the risks of failure outweigh potential
                        gains. He must often settle for the gradual, much as he might prefer the
                        immediate. He must compromise with others, and this means to some extent
                        compromising with himself.</p>
                    <p>The outsider demonstrates his morality by the precision of his perceptions
                        and the loftiness of his ideals. The policymaker expresses his morality by
                        implementing a sequence of imperfections and partial solutions in pursuit of
                            <hi rend="italic">his</hi> ideals.</p>
                    <pb n="87" facs="0118" xml:id="pg_87"/>
                    <p>There must be understanding, as well, of the crucial importance of timing.
                        Opportunities cannot be hoarded; once past, they are usually irretrievable.
                        New relationships in a fluid transitional period—such as today—are delicate
                        and vulnerable; they must be nurtured if they are to thrive. We cannot pull
                        up young shoots periodically to see whether the roots are still there or
                        whether there is some marginally better location for them.</p>
                    <p>We are now at such a time of tenuous beginnings. Western Europe and Japan
                        have joined us in an effort to reinvigorate our relationships. The Soviet
                        Union has begun to practice foreign policy, at least partially, as a
                        relationship between states rather than as international civil war. The
                        People’s Republic of China has emerged from two decades of isolation. The
                        developing countries are impatient for economic and social change. A new
                        dimension of unprecedented challenges—in food, oceans, energy,
                        environment—demands global cooperation.</p>
                    <p>We are at one of those rare moments where through a combination of fortuitous
                        circumstances and design man seems in a position to shape his future. What
                        we need is the confidence to discuss issues without bitter strife, the
                        wisdom to define together the nature of our world, as well as the vision to
                        chart together a more just future.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Détente With the Soviet Union</p>
                    <p>Nothing demonstrates this need more urgently than our relationship with the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>This administration has never had any illusions about the Soviet system. We
                        have always insisted that progress in technical fields, such as trade, had
                        to follow—and reflect—progress toward more stable international relations.
                        We have maintained a strong military balance and a flexible defense posture
                        as a buttress to stability. We have insisted that disarmament had to be
                        mutual. We have judged movement in our relations with the Soviet Union not
                        by atmospherics but by how well concrete problems are resolved and by
                        whether there is responsible international conduct.</p>
                    <p>Coexistence, to us, continues to have a very precise meaning:</p>
                    <p>—We will oppose the attempt by any country to achieve a position of
                        predominance either globally or regionally.</p>
                    <p>—We will resist any attempt to exploit a policy of détente to weaken our
                        alliances.</p>
                    <p>—We will react if relaxation of tensions is used as a cover to exacerbate
                        conflicts in international trouble spots.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union cannot disregard these principles in any area of the world
                        without imperiling its entire relationship with the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="88" facs="0119" xml:id="pg_88"/>
                    <p>On this basis we have succeeded in transforming U.S.-Soviet relations in many
                        important ways. Our two countries have concluded a historic accord to limit
                        strategic arms. We have substantially reduced the risk of direct U.S.-Soviet
                        confrontation in crisis areas. The problem of Berlin has been resolved by
                        negotiation. We and our allies have engaged the Soviet Union in negotiations
                        on major issues of European security, including a reduction of military
                        forces in central Europe. We have reached a series of bilateral agreements
                        on cooperation—health, environment, space, science and technology, as well
                        as trade. These accords are designed to create a vested interest in
                        cooperation and restraint.</p>
                    <p>Until recently the goals of détente were not an issue. The necessity of
                        shifting from confrontation toward negotiation seemed so overwhelming that
                        goals beyond the settlement of international disputes were never raised. But
                        now progress has been made—and already taken for granted. We are engaged in
                        an intense debate on whether we should make changes in Soviet society a
                        precondition for further progress or indeed for following through on
                        commitments already made. The cutting edge of this problem is the
                        congressional effort to condition most-favored-nation (<gloss

                    </p>
                    <p>This is a genuine moral dilemma. There are genuine moral concerns on both
                        sides of the argument. So let us not address this as a debate between those
                        who are morally sensitive and those who are not, between those who care for
                        justice and those who are oblivious to humane values. The attitude of the
                        American people and government has been made emphatically clear on countless
                        occasions in ways that have produced effective results. The exit tax on
                        emigration is not being collected, and we have received assurances that it
                        will not be reapplied; hardship cases submitted to the Soviet Government are
                        being given specific attention; the rate of Jewish emigration has been in
                        the tens of <pb n="89" facs="0120" xml:id="pg_89"/>thousands, where it was
                        once a trickle. We will continue our vigorous efforts on these matters.</p>
                    <p>But the real debate goes far beyond this: Should we now tie demands which
                        were never raised during negotiations to agreements that have already been
                        concluded? Should we require as a formal condition internal changes that we
                        heretofore sought to foster in an evolutionary manner?</p>
                    <p>Let us remember what the <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss> question
                        specifically involves. The very term “most favored nation” is misleading in
                        its implication of preferential treatment. What we are talking about is
                        whether to allow <hi rend="italic">normal</hi> economic relations to
                        develop—of the kind we now have with over 100 other countries and which the
                        Soviet Union enjoyed until 1951. The issue is whether to abolish
                        discriminatory trade restrictions that were imposed at the height of the
                        cold war. Indeed, at that time the Soviet Government discouraged commerce
                        because it feared the domestic impact of normal trading relations with the
                        West on its society.</p>
                    <p>The demand that Moscow modify its domestic policy as a precondition for
                            <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss> or détente was never made while we
                        were negotiating; now it is inserted after both sides have carefully shaped
                        an overall mosaic. Thus it raises questions about our entire bilateral
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the issue affects not only our relationship with the Soviet Union
                        but also with many other countries whose internal structures we find
                        incompatible with our own. Conditions imposed on one country could inhibit
                        expanding relations with others, such as the People’s Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>We shall never condone the suppression of fundamental liberties. We shall
                        urge humane principles and use our influence to promote justice. But the
                        issue comes down to the limits of such efforts. How hard can we press
                        without provoking the Soviet leadership into returning to practices in its
                        foreign policy that increase international tensions? Are we ready to face
                        the crises and increased defense budgets that a return to cold war
                        conditions would spawn? And will this encourage full emigration or enhance
                        the well-being or nourish the hope for liberty of the peoples of Eastern
                        Europe and the Soviet Union? Is it détente that has prompted repression—or
                        is it détente that has generated the ferment and the demand for openness
                        which we are now witnessing?</p>
                    <p>For half a century we have objected to Communist efforts to alter the
                        domestic structures of other countries. For a generation of cold war we
                        sought to ease the risks produced by competing ideologies. Are we now to
                        come full circle and insist on domestic compatibility as a condition of
                        progress?</p>
                    <p>These questions have no easy answers. The government may underestimate the
                        margin of concessions available to us. But a fair debate <pb n="90"
                            facs="0121" xml:id="pg_90"/>must admit that they are genuine questions,
                        the answers to which could affect the fate of all of us.</p>
                    <p>Our policy with respect to détente is clear: We shall resist aggressive
                        foreign policies. Détente cannot survive irresponsibility in any area,
                        including the Middle East. As for the internal policies of closed systems,
                        the United States will never forget that the antagonism between freedom and
                        its enemies is part of the reality of the modern age. We are not neutral in
                        that struggle. As long as we remain powerful, we will use our influence to
                        promote freedom, as we always have. But in the nuclear age we are obliged to
                        recognize that the issue of war and peace also involves human lives and that
                        the attainment of peace is a profound moral concern.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The World as It Is and the World We Seek</p>
                    <p>Addressing the United Nations General Assembly two weeks ago,<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d19fn4">
                            <ref target="#d17">Document 17</ref>.</note> I described our goal as a
                        world where power blocs and balances are no longer relevant; where justice,
                        not stability, can be our overriding preoccupation; where countries consider
                        cooperation in the world interest to be in their national interest.</p>
                    <p>But we cannot move toward the world of the future without first maintaining
                        peace in the world as it is. These very days we are vividly reminded that
                        this requires vigilance and a continuing commitment.</p>
                    <p>So our journey must start from where we are now. This is a time of lessened
                        tension, of greater equilibrium, of diffused power. But if the world is
                        better than our earlier fears, it still falls far short of our hopes. To
                        deal with the present does not mean that we are content with it.</p>
                    <p>The most striking feature of the contemporary period, the feature that gives
                        complexity as well as hope, is the radical transformation in the nature of
                        power. Throughout history power has generally been homogeneous. Military,
                        economic, and political potential were closely related. To be powerful, a
                        nation had to be strong in all categories. Today the vocabulary of strength
                        is more complex. Military muscle does not guarantee political influence.
                        Economic giants can be militarily weak, and military strength may not be
                        able to obscure economic weakness. Countries can exert political influence
                        even when they have neither military nor economic strength.</p>
                    <p>It is wrong to speak of only one balance of power, for there are several,
                        which have to be related to each other. In the military sphere, there are
                        two superpowers. In economic terms, there are at least five major groupings.
                        Politically, many more centers of influence have emerged; <pb n="91"
                            facs="0122" xml:id="pg_91"/>some 80 new nations have come into being
                        since the end of World War II, and regional groups are assuming
                        ever-increasing importance.</p>
                    <p>Above all, whatever the measure of power, its political utility has changed.
                        Throughout history increases in military power, however slight, could be
                        turned into specific political advantage. With the overwhelming arsenals of
                        the nuclear age, however, the pursuit of marginal advantage is both
                        pointless and potentially suicidal. Once sufficiency is reached, additional
                        increments of power do not translate into usable political strength, and
                        attempts to achieve tactical gains can lead to cataclysm.</p>
                    <p>This environment both puts a premium on stability and makes it difficult to
                        maintain. Today’s striving for equilibrium should not be compared to the
                        balance of power of previous periods. The very notion of “operating” a
                        classical balance of power disintegrates when the change required to upset
                        the balance is so large that it cannot be achieved by limited means.</p>
                    <p>More specifically, there is no parallel with the 19th century. Then the
                        principal countries shared essentially similar concepts of legitimacy and
                        accepted the basic structure of the existing international order. Small
                        adjustments in strength were significant. The “balance” operated in a
                        relatively confined geographic area. None of these factors obtain today.</p>
                    <p>Nor when we talk of equilibrium do we mean a simplistic mechanical model
                        devoid of purpose. The constantly shifting alliances that maintained
                        equilibrium in previous centuries are neither appropriate nor possible in
                        our time. In an age of ideological schism the distinction between friends
                        and adversaries is an objective reality. We share ideals as well as
                        interests with our friends, and we know that the strength of our friendships
                        is crucial to the lowering of tensions with our opponents.</p>
                    <p>When we refer to five or six or seven major centers of power, the point being
                        made is not that others are excluded but that a few short years ago everyone
                        agreed that there were only two. The diminishing tensions and the emergence
                        of new centers of power have meant greater freedom of action and greater
                        importance for all other nations.</p>
                    <p>In this setting, our immediate aim has been to build a stable network of
                        relationships that offers hope of sparing mankind the scourges of war. An
                        interdependent world community cannot tolerate either big-power
                        confrontations or recurrent regional crises.</p>
                    <p>But peace must be more than the absence of conflict. We perceive stability as
                        the bridge to the realization of human aspirations, not an end in itself. We
                        have learned much about containing crises, but we have not removed their
                        roots. We have begun to accommodate our dif<pb n="92" facs="0123"
                            xml:id="pg_92"/>ferences, but we have not affirmed our commonality. We
                        may have improved the mastery of equilibrium, but we have not yet attained
                        justice.</p>
                    <p>In the encyclical for which this conference is named, Pope John sketched a
                        greater vision. He foresaw “that no political community is able to pursue
                        its own interests and develop itself in isolation” for “there is a growing
                        awareness of all human beings that they are members of a world
                        community.”</p>
                    <p>The opportunities of mankind now transcend nationalism and can only be dealt
                        with by nations acting in concert:</p>
                    <p>—For the first time in generations mankind is in a position to shape a new
                        and peaceful international order. But do we have the imagination and
                        determination to carry forward this still-fragile task of creation?</p>
                    <p>—For the first time in history we may have the technical knowledge to satisfy
                        man’s basic needs. The imperatives of the modern world respect no national
                        borders and must inevitably open all societies to the world around them. But
                        do we have the political will to join together to accomplish this great
                        end?</p>
                    <p>If this vision is to be realized, America’s active involvement is
                        inescapable. History will judge us by our deeds, not by our good
                        intentions.</p>
                    <p>But it cannot be the work of any one country. And it cannot be the
                        undertaking of any one administration or one branch of government or one
                        party. To build truly is to chart a course that will be carried on by future
                        leaders because it has the enduring support of the American people.</p>
                    <p>So let us search for a fresh consensus. Let us restore a spirit of
                        understanding between the legislative and the executive, between the
                        government and the press, between the people and their public servants. Let
                        us learn once again to debate our methods and not our motives, to focus on
                        our destiny and not on our divisions. Let us all contribute our different
                        views and perspectives, but let us once again see ourselves as engaged in a
                        common enterprise. If we are to shape a world community we must first
                        restore community at home.</p>
                    <p>With Americans working together, America can work with others toward man’s
                        eternal goal of a Pacem in Terris—peace abroad, peace at home, and peace
                        within ourselves.</p>

                    <p>President: The significant thing is that <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> has staked his leadership on better relations with
                        the United States. He needs us for European détente, for trade, and to keep
                        the United States from tilting toward the Chinese. This puts the Middle East
                        into perspective—what will they do. Last May—in May of ’72—they didn’t chuck
                        us for the mining of Haiphong. Of course they must support their clients,
                        but the question is whether they will do it at the jeopardy to all the other
                        fish they have to fry. Henry, you expand.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In 1969, the President
                        announced the concept that came to be known as linkage—the idea that there
                        was a connection between their behavior in Vietnam, Berlin, the Caribbean
                        and general policy. We were violently attacked for this idea. We were told
                        that trade was beneficial in itself and shouldn’t be linked to the political
                        sphere. We were accused of an outmoded Cold War policy. It took us two years
                        to get the Soviet Union to look at things this way. Then we had simultaneous
                        crises in 1970 on the autobahn, in the Caribbean, and in Jordan. Since then
                        the Soviet Union has delivered on every political condition and on
                        lend-lease and we have done nothing. The wheat deal had nothing to <pb
                            n="94" facs="0125" xml:id="pg_94"/>do with détente—we thought that was a
                        good deal.<note n="4" xml:id="d20fn4">Reference is the U.S.-Soviet agreement

                        assurances on the Jews and we keep raising the ante. It must be looked on by
                        them as a deliberate attempt to scuttle détente. One of the riskiest things
                        is to try to play around with the domestic structure of a revolutionary
                        government.</p>
                    <p>Last week I talked to <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> about
                        détente. He says he understands our domestic policy, but in Moscow they are
                        saying that they are being attacked here more than before there was détente.
                        The Europeans are saying to them: “The U.S. is unreliable; trade with us.”
                        If this Soviet leadership fails, it may be years before we can reestablish a
                        dialogue. This frivolous monkeying around with the domestic policy of the
                        Soviet Union can have the most serious consequences. This is one of the most
                        important foreign policy issues of our times.</p>

                    <p>President: Henry will brief you now on the Middle East. This is for guidance,
                        not quotation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: First, let me talk about
                        the situation before the war, then the military situation, then our
                        negotiating strategy. There is a story going around that we held Israel back
                        from a preemptive attack. All our intelligence said there would be no
                        attack. Why did Israel not figure there would be an attack? Because we for
                        four years had been telling them they had to make diplomatic moves.
                        Therefore they developed the posture that there was no need to move, there
                        was no threat, the Arabs are too weak, so they interpreted the intelligence
                        this way. We did the same, but we figured that because they were so good,
                        the Arabs wouldn’t dare to attack.</p>
                    <p>The war showed that Israeli tactics are out of date. The fact is that Israel
                        can no longer score victories like they did in 1967. Their strategy has been
                        to fight on one front at a time. This time they couldn’t do it, so we are in
                        a war of attrition. That is very serious for Israel.</p>
                    <p>President: Before this war Israel felt it had no incentive to negotiate; now
                        they have to make an agonizing reappraisal of that position. They can’t take
                        another war.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Now Israel has to
                        consider how they can enhance their position by diplomacy, not just by
                        military means.</p>
                    <p>We are in a position now where if we can keep the war from escalating and
                        from turning into a confrontation with the Arabs, we have the best chance
                        for settlement.</p>
                    <p>At the President’s very first Cabinet meeting, he said that the greatest
                        danger in the Middle East would be that local powers would draw the
                        superpowers in, as happened in World War I. We have resisted letting the
                        local clients dictate the pace of events. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union
                        have friends to support. The test is whether we can support them and still
                        retain our balance with each other.</p>
                    <p>We could have grandstanded. A Security Council resolution would just have
                        lined people up and brought acrimony. We are trying to get a consensus
                        before we move. When you ask whether the Soviet Union is snookering us, you
                        have to ask what we haven’t done which we would otherwise have done. In
                        practice we have been extremely tough—in massing a great airlift, with no
                        bases except for the Azores from the Portuguese—whom we have kicked
                        around.</p>
                    <p>President: No more.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have told the Soviet
                        Union this is a test of détente, but we have not thrown down the gauntlet.
                        We have our communication lines out to the Arabs. The President met with
                        them yesterday. We <pb n="96" facs="0127" xml:id="pg_96"/>are trying to use
                        diplomacy as a bridge to a decent settlement. We will make our case to the
                        public after the diplomacy has concluded.</p>
                    <p>What you should know is we are trying to conclude in a way to lead to a
                        settlement; we responded to the challenge of the Soviet airlift. Soviet
                        behavior is ambiguous. We are not trying to confront them; we believe they
                        will be working something out.</p>
                    <p>President: The Soviet Union has a problem with the Arabs. They have done well
                        and don’t want to negotiate except on terms Israel can never buy. We are
                        working on a cease fire with a connection to 242.<note n="6" xml:id="d20fn6"

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: 242 is not a new
                        proposal. It is very dangerous to speculate about any particular formula.
                        The major problem now is to get the parties into a negotiation with a
                        formula so vague that each party can save face.</p>
                    <p>Clements: The military services have performed magnificently. It is a
                        complex, beautiful operation.</p>
                    <p>President: The key point is to try to keep the Soviet Union from sending in
                        their own personnel. Do we want to push the Soviet Union—this is what I hear
                        from the “new hawks”—so far that they do this and confront us with a
                        terrible choice?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are taking tough
                        action but speaking softly. We should not escalate until we see how the
                        diplomacy can work out. We are being very quiet and we have put in massive
                        material, with only a modest reaction from the Arabs.</p>

                        Arab-Israeli war. Earlier, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard
                            Nixon</persName>, in an April 18 special message to Congress on energy

                        public should take in conserving energy and developing domestic resources.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> additionally placed

                    <p>“I believe the energy challenge provides an important opportunity for nations

                        provide us with as good an opportunity to demonstrate that there is more to
                        be gained in pursuing our national interests through mutual cooperation than
                        through destructive competition or dangerous confrontation.” (<hi

                            >Nixon</persName> supplemented this message with a June 29 statement
                        outlining additional conservation measures. (Ibid., pages 623–630)</p>
                    <p>On October 18, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries imposed an
                        oil embargo on the United States in light of U.S. support for Israel in the
                        Middle East war. The embargo was later extended to Western Europe and Japan.
                        The embargo underscored the extent of U.S. dependence on foreign fuels, as
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> explained in a November 7
                        address to the nation: “Now, even before war broke out in the Middle East,
                        these prospective shortages were the subject of intensive discussions among
                        members of my Administration, leaders of the Congress, Governors, mayors,
                        and other groups. From these discussions has emerged a broad agreement that
                        we, as a nation, must now set upon a new course.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> called this “new course” “Project
                        Independence,” inspired by the technical successes of both the Manhattan
                        Project and the Apollo space mission. As the President explained: “Today the
                        challenge is to regain the strength that we had earlier in this century, the
                        strength of self-sufficiency. Our ability to meet our own energy needs is
                        directly limited to our continued ability to act decisively and
                        independently at home and abroad in the service of peace, not only for
                        America but for all nations in the world.” He predicted that the United
                        States could achieve energy self-reliance by 1980. Accordingly, the
                        President announced several austerity measures ranging from lowering highway
                        speed limits to reducing the supply of heating oil for homes and businesses.

                        planned for an energy crisis, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                        noted during a November 17 news conference:</p>
                    <p>“I saw this thing coming. And you know why I saw it coming? Not because of
                        the Mideast or the Alaska pipeline and the rest, but because this world with
                        all of its problems is getting richer. Oh, I don’t mean there aren’t a lot
                        of hungry people not only in America, too many here, but if you want to see
                        hungry people, go to India or go to some of the countries in Latin America
                        or upper Brazil, et cetera, et cetera. But generally, as the world gets
                        richer, there is more air-conditioning, there is more need for power, and
                        there is more need for energy. And that is why I sent the message 2 years
                        ago and asked at that time that the Congress consider a program so that the
                        United States should become self-sufficient in energy. All right, I followed
                        that up this year in April <pb n="98" facs="0129" xml:id="pg_98"/>before we
                        even knew there might be or had any idea that—of the Mideast crisis, which
                        made a serious problem, a serious crisis. I asked them for seven pieces of
                        legislation to deal with energy. One has reached my desk, the Alaska
                        pipeline. I signed it. The other six—I hope they act before they go home for
                        Christmas.” (Ibid., page 960)</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Henry will give you
                        a review of the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I will summarize
                        what the President tried to do during the war, where we hope to go over the
                        next few months, and a few words on the oil embargo.</p>
                    <p>During the war there were two objectives: (1), a rapid ceasefire, and (2), to
                        put the U.S. in a position to have a major influence in a settlement.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">During his October 25 press conference, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> “was convinced that we had two
                            major problems: first, to end hostilities as quickly as possible—but
                            secondly, to end hostilities in a manner that would enable us to make a
                            major contribution to removing the conditions that have produced four
                            wars between Arabs and Israelis in the last 25 years.” (Department of
                            State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, November 12, 1973, p. 585)</note>
                        Therefore, we had to do many things which leaned to one side: First, the
                        airlift. If we had allowed a victory of Soviet arms over American arms, the
                        whole balance of power would have shifted. Secondly, the President
                        maintained a personal contact with the Arabs. With the Soviet Union we used
                        our relationship to moderate the conflict and worked with them to bring it
                        to a newer stage.</p>
                    <p>Let me explain what our view is of détente. We want a relationship with the
                        Soviet Union not because the domestic structures of the United States and
                        the Soviet Union are coming closer. Not because they have changed their
                        goals. Détente is necessary because of the vast strategic arsenals of
                        nuclear weapons on both sides. It is an imperative of our policy to prevent
                        a nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>Obviously détente does not prevent incompatible actions in many areas. Nor
                        does it mean that we acquiesce in the policies of severe repression in the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <pb n="99" facs="0130" xml:id="pg_99"/>
                    <p>When I went on the trip to the Middle East, first, we faced the Arab demand
                        for a return of Israeli forces to the 22 October lines. Second, we had to
                        get a negotiating process started. Third, I told the Arabs that only the
                        United States could bring them negotiations and territory. I told <persName
                            corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> he had an historic opportunity. He
                        could argue about the ceasefire line or he could work for a conference which
                        could bring about a true peace. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                        is a wise man. As a result, we negotiated the 6-point plan to consolidate
                        the ceasefire and begin the negotiating process.<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> traveled to the Middle

                    <p>The negotiations are now being organized. This week the Soviet Union and the
                        United States will appeal to the parties to convene a conference.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d22fn4">The Middle East Peace Conference convened in Geneva

                    </p>
                    <p>The reason for doing this under U.S.-Soviet auspices is that a wider forum
                        would widen the quarrel as much as the parties. The Chinese and Soviets
                        would quarrel and the British and French would quarrel with us.</p>
                    <p>Our forum is not yet fully put together but I think it will be this week.
                        Israel can’t do much before January. The first portion will probably be
                        devoted to separation of forces—hopefully to inject some <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces so that the subsequent negotiation
                        can be freer from the prospect of fighting.</p>
                    <p>The second phase is the difficult issue of Israel’s border, security
                        arrangements between Israel and the Arabs, and outside guarantees. We don’t
                        want guarantees such that the United States and Soviet Union are
                        automatically charmed into every little dispute.</p>
                    <p>Our impression is there is more disposition in the Arabs for moderate
                        discussion than at any time since World War II. Nevertheless, there is
                        severe pressure from the rich radical states—Iraq and Libya. Potentially
                        also from the Soviet Union, although not yet. Also regretfully, the British,
                        French, and Japanese, who take positions near those of the radical Arabs.
                        (The <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> made a demand for the October 22
                        line just after <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> had given it
                        up, making his position tough.)</p>
                    <p>The prospects are bright, but it will be difficult.</p>
                    <p>There will be some painful time for Israel, who will have to withdraw from
                        some territories. But Israel can’t want to keep on with these debilitating
                        wars.</p>

                        a religious fanatic, a conservative, a friend of the United States. But he
                        is between Iraq and South Yemen. He therefore tried to leapfrog the radicals
                        and appear as the leader of the Arab cause. Their public views are always
                        fierce, but privately I think they are looking for a way out of it.</p>
                    <p>How do we get out of it?</p>
                    <p>The Europeans and Japan have gone to the Arabs and said “What do you want us
                        to do?” This is intolerable. If we give in to this: (1) It encourages the
                        radical elements. (2) It gives an opportunity to the Europeans to escalate
                        the proposal. (3) It gives an opportunity to the Soviet Union to escalate
                        the proposal. For example, the Africans are now proposing to keep the
                        embargo until the United States stops its racist policies. We could be faced
                        by blackmail from all raw material producers.</p>
                    <p>We will talk with the producers, but not under blackmail. There is some
                        chance they will back off the embargo and give negotiations a chance.</p>
                    <p>The Israeli problem is traumatic. They have relied totally on military
                        supremacy and now know they can’t do that.</p>
                    <p>Let me add a word on the Soviet Union. People say that if détente is so
                        great, how come these confrontations? If we didn’t have problems with the
                        Soviet Union, we wouldn’t need détente.</p>
                    <p>There were some things the Soviet Union did we didn’t like, but in some other
                        ways they were restrained. They gave no encouragement to terrorists. There
                        was never a day when the President and <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> were not in contact. They made a crisis about the
                        Third Army and the President took strong action in order to forestall the
                        introduction of Soviet troops. Once the action was taken, our communications
                        were able to move us quickly to a settlement.</p>
                    <p>This is the meaning of détente and on the whole it has worked. If we keep our
                        nerves and pursue our goals, we have a good chance for a real peace.</p>
                    <p>President: Could you spell out some dates, Henry?</p>

                        will start by the middle of December.</p>
                    <p>President: Let’s talk candidly. We want the embargo lifted, but don’t say
                        anything which would make it hard for the Arabs.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Before the war, Israel
                        thought that any conflict would be a repetition of 1967. Israel thought they
                        couldn’t be in a better position, and there was no real pressure to make
                        them change.</p>
                    <p>Now things are different—the war, and their diplomatic isolation. Basing
                        their policy on automatic U.S.-Soviet hostility on every issue is risky. Of
                        course they put faith in their ability in the U.S. to mobilize strength. We
                        must make clear that we are committed to Israeli security, but it must be
                        sought in other than purely military ways.</p>
                    <p>I think territorial belts of security are better than guarantees. The only
                        guarantee Israel would take seriously would be a U.S. guarantee. A
                        European-U.S. or a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> guarantee they would
                        laugh at. The Soviet Union could guarantee the Arabs.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There are two
                        non-military aspects: Jerusalem and the Palestinians.</p>
                    <p>On the Palestinians and Gaza there is a possibility. Jerusalem is a tough
                        problem. A way must be found to remove the Arab holy places from Israeli
                        control. Egypt doesn’t care much about Jerusalem; Faisal is obsessed by it,
                        but doesn’t care much about the Sinai.</p>
                    <p>Intellectually, Jerusalem is solvable with a Vatican-type setup.</p>

                        now is the election campaign. Since October 22, Israel’s position has
                        evolved and they are willing to talk about things. But the American Jews are
                        so tough and tend to hypo [<hi rend="italic">hype</hi>?] the Israelis and

                        the American Jews. The President is the best friend Israel ever had. In time
                        they will realize that. Israel can’t go on with military solutions. They
                        cannot win a war of attrition.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The answer is delicate.
                        It is in our interest to involve the Soviet Union so they don’t take an
                        extreme position, but we also must make it clear to the Arabs that a
                        settlement can come only through American influence. This is a narrow course
                        to follow. We do it to bolster the moderate Arabs and demonstrate that the
                        extremists won’t get the Arabs anywhere. We will therefore fight radical
                        proposals but move to force Israeli acceptance of moderate proposals.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>: It is not right to say
                        242 doesn’t mean anything.</p>
                    <p>President: It means different things to different people. To us it means what
                        is negotiated.</p>
                    <p>Let me sum up:</p>
                    <p>We are for Israel’s security and we are against any effort to impinge on
                        that. We demonstrated it twice in this conflict—by the airlift and by the
                        alert. The Israeli hawks have to talk this way. But Israel has no friends.
                        They are totally dependent on the United States. As long as we provide the
                        weapons, Israel can lick the Arabs for twenty-five years, but they can’t
                        keep the Soviet Union at bay. What they must ask themselves is what we would
                        do if the Soviets call our hands. This last time we did.</p>
                    <p>—There is no détente with regard to philosophy; the same with China.</p>
                    <p>—We and the Soviet Union disagree on China; our interests in Europe are
                        opposed. But we no more have yearly crises on the autobahn. And in the
                        Middle East. In Southeast Asia, their interests were never so involved that
                        they might get involved. That is true in only three areas: China, Europe,
                        and perhaps in the Middle East. This time, in the Middle East, they decided
                        that relations with us were more important than the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>—Everyone here is for Israeli survival. But it can survive only if it has
                        American support in the face of possible Soviet moves in the Middle
                        East.</p>
                    <p>The American people will be moved by our friends in Congress for weapons but
                        they will back off if they see American forces going into the Middle East
                        against the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Israel can’t base its policy on military security. We need that
                            supplemental<note n="9" xml:id="d22fn9">The administration had requested
                            $2.2 billion in supplemental aid for Israel. Congress approved it in
                            December.</note> so they don’t think we are blackmailing them. A
                        settlement has to cost Israel some territory. That is why we are for 242. It
                        avoids our having to come down on one side or the other.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. is committed to movement on peace. In that case, only the U.S. and
                        the Soviet Union matter and that is why the Soviet Union must play a
                        role.</p>
                    <pb n="104" facs="0135" xml:id="pg_104"/>
                    <p>The third thing, the United States now has good relations with virtually all
                        of the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>We can work with all of them for a settlement. We don’t want to embarrass the
                        Soviet Union.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We want to give the

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The President said in

                        they threw them out and started a war. I must admit the prospects are more
                        favorable than if the war hadn’t happened.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Israel has the capability
                        to make small numbers. Not Egypt. And we don’t think the Soviets have put
                        them in. Should Israel brandish nuclear weapons, the Soviets would counter
                        it and it would be very dangerous for Israel.</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Arabs have learned
                        that in their lifetime they cannot win a war, though they can bleed Israel.
                        The radical Arabs certainly want Israel’s destruction. The moderate Arabs,
                        though, fear that the cost of belligerency jeopardizes the stability of
                        their regimes.</p>
                    <p>I can make a case that Israel is more secure with a border near the 1967
                        border and a security zone than with the present borders and their forces in
                        contact. With a security zone, the Arabs must move from under their <gloss
                            target="#t_SAM_1">SAM</gloss> belt. Not all the Arabs will seek peace,
                        but peace would break the unity of the Arabs because they have different
                        motivations.</p>
                    <p>President: There is another reason. All Arabs are nationalists. The United
                        States has faults, but no one thinks that relations with the United States
                        infringe their independence. That is not true with the Soviet Union and the
                        Arabs know that. That may be partly responsible for Egypt’s throwing out the
                        Soviets in 1972. I think the moderate Arabs would prefer the United States
                        to play a role in a settlement than to be beholden to the Soviet Union.</p>

                    <p>President: You are realistic, but we have no other choices and we must play a
                        role with both sides. Who wants a showdown with the Soviet Union? Only the

                    <p>The Secretary said he wanted to exchange views on Europe with the assembled
                        group which was made up of persons as dedicated to the Atlantic Alliance as
                        we are in the Department. We are faced with a perplexing and disquieting
                        situation and he wanted those present to know what we have attempted to do;
                        if we have gone wrong or if anyone thinks we have been mistaken, he hoped
                        everyone present would be frank in saying so.</p>
                    <p>The overwhelming complaint we receive from the Europeans concerns the lack of
                        consultation. The Secretary therefore wished to go over various subjects to
                        illustrate the problem of consultation and then get the judgement of the
                        group.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Year of Europe</p>
                    <p>The first time this phrase had been used was in the Secretary’s press
                        conference in December 1972, when he said that relations with the Soviet
                        Union were not our paramount goal and that soon after the Viet-Nam conflict
                        was over we would undertake a major reappraisal with regard to Western
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>In December of 1972, when the Secretary was in Paris for Viet-Nam talks, he
                        had seen <persName corresp="#p_PG_1">Pompidou</persName> for 1½ hours and
                        had explained to him what we planned to do in connection with Europe and
                        that we wanted to do this in the closest cooperation with France. The
                        Secretary saw </p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> at Camp David, during
                        which the conversation had all been about the “Year of Europe”. The
                        Agreement to Prevent Nuclear War<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d14">Document 14</ref>.</note> had also been discussed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary had also talked with <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Egon
                            Bahr</persName> concerning the “Year of Europe”.</p>
                    <p>Subsequent to the April 23 speech,<note n="4" xml:id="d23fn4">
                            <ref target="#d8">Document 8</ref>.</note> everyone complained that they
                        had only received twenty-four hours notice of the actual text. This was
                        necessary because of our own bureaucratic requirements. Perhaps some phrases
                        in the speech should have been changed, but that is not the heart of the
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went on to describe what we were attempting to accomplish
                        through the approach outlined in his April 23 speech in terms of
                        revitalizing the Atlantic Alliance in the light of changed circumstances. He
                        described in detail the reaction of some of our Allies to the proposals in
                        the speech. <persName corresp="#p_BW_1">Brandt</persName> had warmly
                        welcomed the speech and had told the President he objected to the word
                        “charter” but had no objection to the content suggested for a declaration.
                        The British had strongly welcomed the speech and <persName corresp="#p_HE_1"
                            >Heath</persName> had proposed a steering committee of the major Allies
                        to work on an appropriate response. The British Foreign Office, which was
                        concerned about the exclusion of Italy from such a committee, suggested that
                        a reply could be prepared by a meeting of Deputy Foreign Ministers of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> countries. There never was a
                        suggestion that the U.S. should deal with Europe as a bloc.</p>
                    <p>When the Secretary saw <persName corresp="#p_JM_1">Jobert</persName>, he
                        opposed the whole idea and said it was an attempt to establish U.S.
                        hegemony. <persName corresp="#p_JM_1">Jobert</persName> warned that if we
                        tried to get Europe as a group involved in the exercise this would lead to a
                        break. He said we were putting up <persName corresp="#p_DE_1"
                            >Davignon</persName> in an effort to get the Nine involved. The French
                        proposal was for a series of bilateral consultations between the major
                        countries (not including Italy) after which there should be a Deputy Foreign
                        Ministers’ meeting.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary met three more times with <persName corresp="#p_JM_1"

                        that their versions of the Atlantic Declaration would be better than

                            speech. During an October 12 news conference, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> explained that the

                        same time, there was an amazing incongruity between these remarks and
                        stories which were being fed daily to the press in the countries concerned
                        relating how the foreign officials were facing the President down and also
                        alleging that the U.S. was attempting to globalize issues and denigrate the
                        “Year of Europe”.</p>
                    <p>At the end of July, after we had accepted every proposal made to us by the
                        Europeans, they announced to us that they planned to get together as the
                        Nine to prepare their response and that in the meantime they would not
                        communicate with the U.S. We would hear from the Danish Foreign Minister who
                        would come to us as an instructed representative. We were to know nothing
                        about the drafting process.</p>
                    <p>This started something which the Secretary found extraordinarily worrisome.
                        The declaration itself is not so important; we will finish it in a tolerable
                        way and we won’t invest great capital resolving the outstanding questions.
                        But the Nine won’t discuss with us until they have made their decision and
                        we are faced with the situation where the countries who can negotiate with
                        us won’t talk and those who can talk with us can’t negotiate.</p>
                    <p>We agreed that meetings with the Nine would be at the Assistant Secretary
                        level to work on the declaration and the U.S. has been represented by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ_1">Stoessel</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SH_1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>. The negotiations had hardly
                        been normal, however; there is no real negotiation, since the Europeans
                        state their position, then we state ours, and then the Europeans go away to
                        work out their response, after which the whole process is repeated. Thus,
                        whereas we hoped that the Common Market would lead to better relations with
                        the U.S., we now are forced into a type of consultation which is worse than
                        we have with any other country.</p>
                    <p>We had proposed that the declaration include Japan and had suggested a
                        trilateral declaration. The Europeans have resisted this. Recently they sent
                        a note to the Japanese with no advance notice to us sug<pb n="108"
                            facs="0139" xml:id="pg_108"/>gesting bilateral negotiations between the
                            <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> and Japan. The last paragraph of the
                        note said that any declaration which included the U.S. would have to be
                        vague and general but that a declaration confined to the <gloss
                            target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> and Japan could be concrete. The Secretary
                        asked what our presence would do to make such a declaration vague.</p>
                    <p>We therefore have both substantive and procedural objections to the approach
                        to Japan; we feel that this action is really extraordinary for friendly
                        countries. Japan is the last nation in the world which should be exposed to
                        the temptation of a competition as to which power can offer more. Like
                        Germany in <persName corresp="#p_AK_1">Adenauer</persName>’s day, Japan
                        needs to be firmly involved in a structured relationship and the separate
                        approach of the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> goes against this.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> has also approached Canada separately,
                        with a view to excluding the U.S. The <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> has
                        never told us about this but we learned about it from the Canadians.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> made a declaration on the Middle East
                        early in November with no advance warning to us. It was published the day
                        the Secretary arrived in Cairo<note n="6" xml:id="d23fn6">November 6.</note>
                        and proved highly embarrassing to <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                            >Sadat</persName>, particularly on the point of returning to the October
                        22 cease-fire lines.</p>
                    <p>Leaving aside procedural points, we have reached a situation where, under
                        French leadership and with the acquiesence of the British, the Europeans are
                        seeking their identity in opposition to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>This has reached such a point that a few days ago a French official, in
                        talking to a member of our Embassy in Paris, accused us of clearing the
                            <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> Middle East declaration in advance
                        with the Dutch.</p>
                    <p>All of this forms a very worrisome pattern. Our transgressions can be fixed.
                        But the European approach is organically imbedded in the structure which
                        they have created.</p>
                    <p>The emotional content has been drained from the declaration exercise. The
                        Europeans refuse to use the word “partnership”. They allege that we have no
                        consultations with them but at the same time they reject the idea that new
                        conditions require new forms of consultations. They assert that they want an
                        undiminished commitment of the U.S. to go to war to defend Europe but at the
                        same time they refuse to sign a declaration at the head-of-government level.
                        The Secretary felt that we shouldn’t waste too much time on all this but in
                        fact the malaise is going deeper all the time.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1"
                            >Vance</persName> about the French attitude, the Secretary said it is
                        clear that the French made a decision early <pb n="109" facs="0140"
                            xml:id="pg_109"/>this year basically to oppose the U.S. The President
                        really is pro-Gaullist; the Secretary said he himself had written articles
                        in the past favorable to the Gaullist point of view (he now felt these were
                        probably wrong). We have not counterattacked the French and we are being
                        criticized for not doing so by many in Europe. Nevertheless the French
                        escalate their attacks on our policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> asked if the French want our
                        troops out of Europe. The Secretary said they did not. The French say it is
                        in our interest to have the troops there. When we say that <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> can no longer be based entirely on
                        defense considerations, the French say this is a subterfuge for pressing
                        U.S. hegemony.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the British had made a decision in June to earn their
                        spurs as Europeans by supporting the French. The British have provided
                        expertise and legitimacy. They have not led the charge against us, but they
                        have been only one step behind. At the same time, we hear constant appeals
                        from the European countries to understand their situation and their
                        inability to counter the French position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> asked about <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSA_1">Sir Alec Douglas-Home</persName>. The Secretary said
                        he felt <persName corresp="#p_HE_1">Heath</persName> really has no emotional
                        commitment to the U.S. He has an intellectual commitment, but not an
                        emotional one. He is really more inclined toward the French. Sir Alec
                        perhaps has more emotional commitment to our side. When the Secretary had
                        seen Sir Alec in October, Sir Alec had said he hoped the Secretary would
                        make a strong speech in London countering the French views. It seemed odd
                        that the Secretary was asked to say this in London when the British would
                        not.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the British situation is particularly painful to us.
                        Before, we did not treat the British as a foreign government. We have relied
                        on them as a bridge to Europe. This year we consulted constantly with
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSB_1">Burke Trend</persName> and showed him all
                        our work papers. We understand that the British do not want to repeat the
                        mistake they feel they made in Nassau with Macmillan. However, the British
                        are very doctrinaire about Europe. They are milking us for intelligence
                        information but they are making no input on their own.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question, the Secretary said that <persName
                            corresp="#p_CE_1">Lord Cromer</persName> is of no help, although he is
                        well meaning. We know what the British are doing in Cairo. We saw <persName
                            corresp="#p_CE_1">Cromer</persName> constantly and gave him information;
                        our information is being used as much in Cairo to support a separate U.K.
                        position as it is to support a common position.</p>
                    <p>Previously, there was a constant exchange of leaders at the highest level
                        with the British. This does not take place now, and it is at their
                        initiative.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the French lead the charge against us in the Nine while
                        the U.K. does the same in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="110" facs="0141" xml:id="pg_110"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Détente</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there are bound to be problems in the Alliance when the
                        senior partner is seen to be dealing intensively with the Soviet Union.
                        However, practically every Allied leader asked us to do this; they wanted us
                        to push <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1"
                            >MBFR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, and they
                        themselves signed their own declarations with the Soviet Union before we
                        conceived of our own.</p>
                    <p>All of this presents particular problems in connection with consultation, and
                        we recognize this. So far as <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> is
                        concerned, we have made a real effort on consultation and this has been
                        successful; it is a matter of contention now.</p>
                    <p>Last fall, the U.K. led the charge against us in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> on <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>. They made a big
                        fuss about the fact that we had set a date to begin <gloss
                            target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> talks with the Soviets. This is
                        something all the Foreign Ministers had wanted to fix and it is true that
                        when the Secretary was in Moscow he talked with the Soviets and we agreed on
                        a date. This episode left some feeling of acrimony.</p>
                    <p>What really hurt was the argument about Hungary being in the <gloss
                            target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> talks. We were accused of sacrificing
                        the security of Central Europe by dropping Hungary as a direct participant.
                        The U.K. wanted Hungary in and the Soviets said that if Hungary were in then
                        Italy should be in. We wanted to keep both Hungary and Italy out. It was
                        really a nothing issue. We didn’t want Italy in because this would involve
                        the Sixth Fleet and could also bring Greece and Turkey in, which in turn
                        would lead to bringing in Bulgaria and Romania. We felt it would be best for
                        the Western countries to go for a common ceiling which would exclude Soviet
                        forces in Hungary. If these forces were excluded then Soviet reductions
                        under the Western plan would amount to a ratio of 3 to 1; with the forces in
                        Hungary included, the ratio would be 6 to 1. We couldn’t ask for this and
                        therefore felt that the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> guideline
                        area was the only possible basis. If we looked at cuts from a percentage
                        standpoint, it also did not make sense to include the forces in Hungary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary repeated that this was not really a policy issue. However, the
                        British raised it twice to the presidential level and several times to the
                        Secretary of State. This can only be ascribed to a British desire to be a
                        spokesman in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> against the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Even more worrisome has been the debate about the Agreement on Prevention of
                        Nuclear War. The folklore in Europe is that this was sprung without any
                        warning and that the agreement leaves the Europeans to the mercy of the
                        Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_JM_1">Jobert</persName> says this constantly
                        and no one else in Europe contradicts him.</p>
                    <pb n="111" facs="0142" xml:id="pg_111"/>
                    <p>Actually, the Soviets originally proposed a treaty which would have to be
                        ratified and which specified agreement on no first use of nuclear weapons
                        between the Soviet Union and the U.S. If we had agreed to this sort of
                        thing, it could have had the consequences which the French say the present
                        agreement has.</p>
                    <p>We informed the British, French, and Germans of our talks with the Soviets on
                        this subject even before we informed the State Department. (This might seem
                        a strange way to proceed but the situation has now been rectified.) The
                        Germans generally favored the project. The British and ourselves held
                        extensive consultations and concluded that, if we could change the agreement
                        so as to state objectives and could phrase it so that it would be aimed at
                        avoiding any war, rather than just nuclear war, and could apply not only to
                        the U.S. and the Soviet Union but also to any third country and could exempt
                        existing alliances—then it would be a good thing. It would place an
                        obligation on the Soviets to state that the way to avoid nuclear war is to
                        avoid any war and could counter the Soviet effort to differentiate between
                        nuclear and other types of war.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the final agreement was drafted 90 per cent by <persName
                            corresp="#p_BST_1">Sir Thomas Brimelow</persName>. The British, French,
                        and Germans were kept informed at all stages of negotiations. Nothing was
                        done that they did not know about. It is true that the French were not
                        enthusiastic but they never said what they are now saying. They claimed only
                        that the agreement could promote the illusion of détente; they never said
                        anything about the agreement leaving Europe undefended.</p>
                    <p>With all this background, it was shocking that, when the agreement was raised
                        in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, the representatives of the U.K.,
                        France, and Germany did nothing to help and only asked questions which had
                        already been asked and answered before in our consultations. This was a
                        cynical performance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_JM_1">Jobert</persName>, in a recent speech to the
                        National Assembly has cited the agreement as the reason why Europeans must
                        create a defense community and why Europe must at all costs be independent
                        of the U.S.</p>
                    <p>We are not against European identity or even a European defense community.
                        But we are concerned that this not be on an anti-American basis.</p>
                    <p>It is true that some of the smaller countries have more reason to complain
                        about lack of consultation. We relied on the U.K. and the Germans to be our
                        spokesmen.</p>
                    <p>So far as the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> principles are
                        concerned, the Europeans were actively engaged in drafting them with the
                        U.S. There is no problem about this.</p>

                    <p>You can’t put everything before the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        Council. We therefore, have had a tendency to confine our consultations to
                        the U.K., France, and Germany. Maybe this was a mistake, but it is
                        correctable.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Oil</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that, of course, the question of oil is of utmost gravity
                        to Europe and to the U.S. The best guarantee for a resumption of oil
                        shipments is the speedy resolution of a peace settlement.<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d23fn7">See <ref target="#d21">Document 21</ref>. The embargo
                            was not ended until March 1974.</note> This depends on Israeli
                        withdrawal and a modicum of restraint on the Arab side so that the whole
                        thing doesn’t turn into a surrender operation.</p>
                    <p>We must demonstrate to the Arabs the limits of what is obtainable. But this
                        is very difficult when the Europeans are attempting to ingratiate themselves
                        with the Arabs on a short-term basis.</p>
                    <p>What we want to do is set up a peace conference and get some progress at it.
                        Then we will tell the Arabs that further progress depends on an easing of
                        the oil threat. We can’t get into a negotiation with Faisal linking the
                        peace terms with the oil supplies; this would be very dangerous.</p>
                    <p>In general, the whole idea of blackmail by raw material producing countries
                        is very dangerous. The <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> countries are
                        now thinking about this.</p>
                    <p>Our strategy with the Arabs is not working badly. The Saudis have a good idea
                        of what the Europeans can deliver.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> asked if Libya and Iraq are
                        sending oil to Europe “under the rug”. The Secretary said that Iraq has
                        special arrangements with the French. He remarked that, when one sees
                        intelligence reports of what the U.K. and the French are saying to the
                        Arabs, it is worse than it was in the thirties. [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines

                    <p>The Secretary said that he considered Atlantic relations central to our
                        foreign policy. If we cannot restore some vitality to this relationship,
                        then it is hard to see where either side will go. The problem is very
                        profound and certainly is not explainable by a lack of consultation. The
                        real problem is that some Europeans want to organize unity against the U.S.
                        Perhaps this is based on the idea that they must oppose some one in order to
                        achieve this unity.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> asked about consultations
                        with Japan. The Secretary said that the Japanese have done many of the
                        things the Europeans have done. But they have acted out of despair, not on
                        the basis of strategy. Tanaka is in a difficult situation. If the Japanese
                        could get the oil they need, then there would be no problem. The Japanese
                        are desperate.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> said that, over all,
                        relations with Japan seemed on a better track. The Secretary agreed, saying
                        that, if it were not for the oil crisis, relations with Japan would be
                        better than they have ever been. We are saying as little as possible in a
                        critical sense about Japan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> asked about Germany.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said there is no strong leadership in either party. The <gloss
                            target="#t_CDU_1">CDU</gloss> is developing new leadership but hasn’t
                        found a new orientation as yet. The Socialists are split between the
                        increasingly radical leftist group and the traditional group. Leber is the
                        only reliable Atlanticist in the Socialist Party. Schmidt is also an
                        Atlanticist, but he has been ill and he is maneuvering for political
                        position which means that he must pay attention to the Left. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SW_1">Scheel</persName> is not too strong a personality, but
                        basically he is all right. However, he has been overruled about the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> asked about <persName
                            corresp="#p_CK_1">Carstens</persName>. The Secretary said he was very
                        good but that he does not have much influence. <persName corresp="#p_BW_1"
                            >Brandt</persName> basically is weak. He makes big speeches but there is
                        little follow-through. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> said
                        that Kiep is a good person, and the Secretary said that he wanted to see him
                        during his visit to Washington.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> said the Germans are very
                        worried and they are a little ashamed of their attitude. He was nervous
                        about <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bahr</persName> and Wehner. The Secretary
                        said that Wehner seems to have reverted to his attitude of the fifties. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> said that the acute
                        problem in Germany was not Ostpolitik but Westpolitik, both for the <gloss
                            target="#t_SPD_1">SPD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_CDU_1"
                            >CDU</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> said that Kiep recommended
                        that what was needed was another statement by the Secretary reiterating
                        attachment to the unity of Europe. We should say that we are steadfast but
                        we should also stress the idea of partnership with the U.S. Otherwise the
                        Alliance will not work. The Secretary said that he was planning to give a
                        speech to the Pilgrim Society in which he would speak about partnership.
                        However, the Allies don’t want to accept this.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ_1">Stoessel</persName> said that they made a
                        distinction between relationships in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>,
                        where partnership seemed acceptable, and relationships between the U.S. and
                        the nine members of the Community, where partnership was apparently not
                        acceptable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> thought this was
                        understandable. He expressed the view that, if the Secretary was going to
                        make a tough statement about relations with the Allies, he should make it in
                        the U.S. and not in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> said he was against a speech
                        of recrimination. He thought there was value in private candor but he
                        doubted the utility of going public.</p>

                    <p>There was some discussion of <persName corresp="#p_HE_1">Heath</persName>’s
                        attitude. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> noted that,
                        when he had seen <persName corresp="#p_HE_1">Heath</persName> recently,
                        there had seemed to be something wrong in <persName corresp="#p_HE_1"
                            >Heath</persName>’s views about the U.S. He seemed to be in a state of
                        pique about something. The Secretary said he didn’t know what was bothering
                        him. He thought he might ask <persName corresp="#p_HE_1">Heath</persName>
                        about what he should say in his speech.<note n="8" xml:id="d23fn8">Reference

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> asked if the Administration
                        as a whole and especially the President felt it was necessary to speak out
                        publicly at this stage. After all, there is nothing particularly new about
                        the present situation involving French opposition. However, he acknowledged
                        that the U.K. factor is different and it is disturbing.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said this was true. Also, the Germans are weaker than they have
                        been. The President feels we should not pretend to the Europeans that
                        everything is okay or act on the pretense that everything in the Alliance is
                        all right.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion emphasizing that there was a difference between
                        what was said publicly at a speech to the Pilgrims and what was said
                        privately.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> commented that there were
                        three nightmares about the Middle East which were important to the
                        Europeans. The first was the possibility of a significant Soviet presence in
                        the area which would be more dangerous to Europe than the U.S. The second
                        was the development of an imbalance of forces which would threaten the
                        annihilation of Israel. This would bring about the possibility of use of
                        nuclear weapons which the world could not face. The third was the prospect
                        of no peace at all but a continuation of periodic fighting. This would
                        involve the Arabs adopting a suicidal attitude on oil at the cost of Europe
                        and Japan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> said there was the old
                        problem of how to persuade the Israelis to make concessions. He felt that
                        people in the Jewish community in the U.S. were misleading Israel about this
                        matter. He could say that in the boondocks, away from Washington, there was
                        no sentiment of all-out support of Israel. He wondered if it might indeed
                        not be a good idea to let the Europeans go ahead under pressure from the
                        Arabs and tell the Israelis they had to withdraw. He did not feel it was for
                        us to contribute to the crescendo of public recrimination against the
                        Atlantic Allies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> continued that he felt our
                        European friends do not adequately recognize the growing mood of withdrawal
                        from world affairs <pb n="115" facs="0146" xml:id="pg_115"/>held by many in
                        the U.S. If people knew about the lack of consultation, the formation of
                        European unity against us and the problems of burdensharing, they would see
                        that our troops were withdrawn from Europe very quickly. The Europeans have
                        a stake in all this and they should realize it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we can eliminate public recrimination at this time.
                        He had felt it was a good idea in October to give the Europeans a shot
                        across the bow in order to counter charges of a lack of consultation. The
                        Pilgrim speech could either be cancelled or he could make it
                        non-recriminatory in nature. The problem is how to turn the present trends
                        around.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD_1">Dillon</persName> asked what the French
                        really want. Of course they have always been difficult and their present
                        stance is no surprise.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the Europeans are conducting a domestic but not a
                        foreign policy. De Gaulle had a foreign policy. <persName corresp="#p_PG_1"
                            >Pompidou</persName>, however, has an economic policy but not a foreign
                        policy. The Quai is very Gaullist and nasty. Perhaps they have no concept
                        other than getting the U.S. out of Europe and working for European unity
                        under our protection. It is strange, but <persName corresp="#p_JM_1"
                            >Jobert</persName> always is very conciliatory when he sees the
                        Secretary, but when he gets home he is mean and critical.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD_1">Dillon</persName> thought it would be
                        important to talk with other people in France, such as <persName
                            corresp="#p_CDJ_1">Chaban-Delmas</persName>. They might be more moderate
                        and might be influential in the future.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary repeated that he did not plan to engage in recrimination.
                        However, the Europeans must understand what they are doing. They view the
                        U.S. as being inexhaustably pro-Atlantic. But there are limits to our store
                        of good will. The Europeans should consider the list of possible
                        presidential candidates for the next election in the U.S. No one shows up as
                        very pro-European. They should reflect on this and understand that the
                        present Administration is more strongly Atlantic-minded than future
                        Administrations are likely to be.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName> noted that the oil
                        problem will have a seminal effect on all relations over a period of time.
                        He also felt the financial implications were most important, particularly
                        having in mind the large Arab balances in the West. They could use these for
                        another war if they wanted it. Speaking of the trilateral grouping of the
                        U.S., Europe, and Japan, he said the only hope seems to be to work together
                        and not separately.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would make this point at <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>. Until now, the Europeans have refused to get together
                        themselves. This has been true even in the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1"
                            >OECD</gloss> energy committee. The Secretary felt that the energy
                        problem is of long-range importance to all consumer countries and he would
                        tell the Europeans this. We are prepared to discuss with <pb n="116"

                        carry on such consultations directly with the Europeans.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName> said he felt the
                        monetary aspects of the oil crisis were almost more important than the oil
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we must avoid a situation in which the Europeans are
                        milking us on everything important for them but are against us on everything
                        else.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName> said that, in the long
                        term, the Arab pressures are more important for the Europeans than they are
                        for ourselves. The Secretary commented that actually we are in a better
                        position with the Arabs than the Europeans. At least, the Arabs take us
                        seriously. He thought we would settle our oil problem with the Arabs as soon
                        as the Europeans did, if not before.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the Europeans complain about being excluded from the
                        Middle East negotiations. However, the Europeans are too one-sided to serve
                        as mediator and they are too separated from us to have any influence on us.
                        If the Europeans are excluded, this is something that they did to
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> hoped we would see the
                        present crisis as an opportunity, not as a situation of despair. Joint
                        action is essential to solve the Arab-Israeli situation and the oil
                        situation. He recognized that we can’t do much about helping Europe on oil,
                        since we have no surplus.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said we must do something for the Dutch.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> hoped the Secretary would
                        see Jerry Wagner of Shell. He is Dutch and has some good ideas. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> urged the Secretary to be
                        firm but not recriminatory. He hoped he could be as forthcoming as possible.
                        The Secretary agreed that we have an opportunity to bring the Europeans to
                        recognize the abyss before which they stand. We need to put constructive
                        things before them. He agreed this could best be done privately rather than
                        publicly. At the same time, we must show clearly what the attitude of the
                        U.S. is and that they can’t get things from us for free. There must be
                        reciprocity in the relationship. They must tell us what they are doing in
                        the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> wondered if it was really
                        possible for us to develop a common policy on Europe, given the domestic
                        problem we have at <pb n="117" facs="0148" xml:id="pg_117"/>home. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> said that, when the
                        Secretary is ready, it should be possible to mobilize pressures in the U.S.
                        to get Israel to implement the 1967 Resolution. The Jewish community knows
                        this is coming. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> meeting, the
                        Secretary said he had tentatively decided, if the French make any
                        accusations against us—such as to say that we had exposed Europe to attack
                        because of our policies toward the Soviet Union—we would react with extreme
                        sharpness. We would point out some of the consequences of the course they
                        are now embarked on.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> questioned how sharply we
                        should respond and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> said we
                        should do so only if we are clearly and unmistakably criticized. In that
                        event, we might rally support of others.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> said the energy problem is in
                        no sense limited to the Arab-Israeli conflict. With regard to the Alliance,
                        any alliance of course tends to erode with success. He was inclined to drop
                        the struggle about the word “partnership” and try to find something else. He
                        doubted if it was all that important. He thought it would be desirable if we
                        could propose—perhaps in the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>—a joint
                        R and D program concerning all forms of energy. We could make some
                        suggestions about financing, perhaps on the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss> pattern, and make an initial contribution ourselves. This
                        sort of thing might bring people together and seize their imagination.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> thought the timing for such
                        an idea would not be good now. It might give the impression of ganging up on
                        the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that in principle he would approve a program of the type
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Dean Rusk</persName> had mentioned. He
                        wondered what the French would say. They seem to be telling the others that
                        all they needed to do was to kick the U.S. around and we would give them
                        everything.</p>
                    <p>On the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> meeting, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> thought it would be good for <persName
                            corresp="#p_LJ_1">Luns</persName> to have a private session where the
                        Secretary could make the last speech. Perhaps he could tease the others a
                        bit, with a light touch, asking them where they thought they were going.
                        This could avoid personal offense. Ridicule and irony are also weapons.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> regretted that the
                        President had stressed the concept of self-sufficiency so much in his energy
                        speech. He had hoped that there could be some word of sympathy in the speech
                        for the European problems and that we were disposed to help.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName> said that the idea of
                        self-sufficiency for the U.S. by 1980 is quite unrealistic.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the U.S. is prepared to work out a program in the
                        spirit of the suggestion by <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Dean
                        Rusk</persName>. We would be having a meeting later this week about it.
                        However, to do something of this kind <pb n="118" facs="0149"
                            xml:id="pg_118"/>after a year of the type we have just had might seem to
                        support the French argument that you can get everything you want from the
                        U.S. by kicking the U.S. around.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> thought a lot of the things
                        mentioned were relatively marginal. He regretted that we had gotten into a
                        drafting war on the declarations. The Secretary said we had not.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD_1">Dillon</persName> thought it would be a good
                        idea for us to develop our own energy program for the future and give the
                        Europeans an opportunity to join in if they wished to do so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> suggested it might be useful
                        if someone in the Department could do a war game exercise which would show
                        how all of this had looked from the European point of view. In that way, we
                        might get a better fix on the mistakes we had made. The Secretary agreed and
                        asked that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGSJ_1">Springsteen</persName>
                        undertake such a study.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> said that, if the energy
                        plan is really a good one, then it shouldn’t matter whether the Europeans
                        feel they are getting a free ride or not.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> remarked that the Europeans
                        have felt ever since 1962 that they are getting a free ride and that there
                        is no threat. In general, they have underestimated the dangers of détente
                        and overestimated the worth of détente.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD_1">Dillon</persName> thought there actually was quite a
                        bit of uneasiness in Europe about present trends. They hoped we would not
                        take the initiative in attacking but would only counterattack.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said the Europeans find it so astonishing that they can even
                        get themselves together to make a reply that they ignore the substance. Then
                        they send a note to the Japanese and make an approach to the Arabs but still
                        don’t focus on the substance and the meaning of what they are doing. Perhaps
                        it’s because they don’t have a Foreign Office to tell them they should
                        consult first.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> wondered if we would really
                        be hurt if the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> establishes contacts with
                        the Japanese. The Secretary thought that this sort of thing was dangerous,
                        particularly with the Japanese.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> said that no European
                        wants the annihilation of Israel. Also, the Arabs don’t want the Soviets in
                        the Middle East. In this situation, if we don’t get any cooperation from the
                        Europeans then this is the heart of the problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> recalled that in 1948 the
                        Europeans felt that they could go along with any solution in the Middle East
                        agreeable to the Jews and the Arabs. He thought we should tell the Europeans
                        to get busy and work on this policy in the Middle East.</p>
                    <pb n="119" facs="0150" xml:id="pg_119"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> said he didn’t mind our

                        that.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RKW_1">Rush</persName> wondered if it would be
                        useful for someone to write a good article in <hi rend="italic">Foreign

                        useful.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that we were heading into a difficult period domestically
                        with the Jewish community. There was general discussion about this, with
                        several expressing the view that some influential leaders in the Jewish
                        community were beginning to say that all-out support for Israel was not
                        necessarily the best policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName> raised the problem of

                        him in the Senate.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion of attitudes in Israel toward a peace settlement.
                        Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_2">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> thought there were doves in Israel in
                        various places. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> mentioned
                        Saphir. They will talk to unofficial American friends but not to our
                        Ambassador. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_1">McCloy</persName> thought that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG_1">Golda Meir</persName> and <persName

                    <p rend="center">The United States and a Unifying Europe: The Necessity for
                        Partnership</p>
                    <p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to you this evening because, like
                        most Americans, I am seized by a mixture of pride and terror when invited to
                        appear before a British audience. In my particular case, and without any
                        reflection on this distinguished assemblage, it is probably more terror than
                        pride; for there is no blinking the fact—it is there for all to hear—that my
                        forebears missed the Mayflower by some 300 years.</p>
                    <p>Our two peoples have been more closely associated than any other two nations
                        in modern history—in culture and economics, in peace and in war. We have
                        sometimes disagreed. But the dominant theme of our relationship in this
                        century has been intimate alliance and mighty creations.</p>
                    <p>In 1950, while the Atlantic alliance was considering a continuing political
                        body, my great predecessor <persName corresp="#p_AD_1">Dean
                            Acheson</persName> spoke to this society. Describing the travails of
                        creation, <persName corresp="#p_AD_1">Acheson</persName> noted that a
                        “strange and confusing dissonance has crowded the trans-Atlantic
                        frequencies.” But he added that this “dissonance flows from the very
                        awareness that difficult decisions must be made and is a part of the process
                        of making them.”</p>
                    <p>Again today America and Western Europe find themselves at a moment of great
                        promise and evident difficulty, of renewed efforts to unite and old problems
                        which divide. It is a time of both hope and concern for all of us who value
                        the partnership we have built together. Today, as in 1950, we and Europe
                        face the necessity, the opportunity, and the dilemma of fundamental
                        choice.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Year of Europe</p>
                    <p>Because we have a historical and intimate relationship, I want to speak
                        tonight frankly of what has been called the “Year of Europe”—of the
                        difficulties of 1973 and the possibilities of 1974 and beyond.</p>

                            xml:id="d24fn2">See <ref target="#d8">Document 8</ref>.</note> He did so
                        because it was obvious that the assumptions on which the alliance was
                        founded have been outstripped by events:</p>
                    <p>—Europe’s economic strength, political cohesion, and new confidence—the
                        monumental achievements of Western unity—have radically altered a
                        relationship that was originally shaped in an era of European weakness and
                        American predominance.</p>
                    <p>—American nuclear monopoly has given way to nuclear parity, raising wholly
                        new problems of defense and deterrence—problems which demand a broad
                        reexamination of the requirements of our security and the relative
                        contribution to it of the United States and its allies.</p>
                    <p>—The lessening of confrontation between East and West has offered new hope
                        for a relaxation of tensions and new opportunities for creative
                        diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>—It has become starkly apparent that the great industrialized democracies of
                        Japan, Europe, and North America could pursue divergent paths only at the
                        cost of their prosperity and their partnership.</p>
                    <p>These historic changes were occurring in a profoundly changed psychological
                        climate in the West. The next generation of leaders in Europe, Canada, and
                        America will have neither the personal memory nor the emotional commitment
                        to the Atlantic alliance or its founders. Even today, a majority on both
                        sides of the Atlantic did not experience the threat that produced the
                        alliance’s creation or the sense of achievement associated with its growth.
                        Even today, in the United States over 40 Senators consistently vote to make
                        massive unilateral reductions of American forces in Europe. Even today, some
                        Europeans have come to believe that their identity should be measured by its
                        distance from the United States. On both sides of the Atlantic we are faced
                        with the anomalous—and dangerous—situation in which the public mind
                        identifies foreign policy success increasingly with relations with
                        adversaries while relations with allies seem to be characterized by
                        bickering and drift.</p>
                    <p>There exists, then, a real danger of a gradual erosion of the Atlantic
                        community which for 25 years has insured peace to its nations and brought
                        prosperity to its peoples. A major effort to renew Atlantic relations and to
                        anchor our friendship in a fresh act of creation seemed essential. We hoped
                        that the drama of the great democracies engaging themselves once again in
                        defining a common future would infuse our Atlantic partnership with new
                        emotional and intellectual excitement. <pb n="122" facs="0153"
                            xml:id="pg_122"/>This was the origin of the initiative which came to be
                        called the “Year of Europe.”</p>
                    <p>Let me lay to rest certain misconceptions about American intentions:</p>
                    <p>—The President’s initiative was launched after careful preparation. In all of
                        our conversations with many European leaders during the winter and spring of
                        1972–73 there was agreement that Atlantic relations required urgent
                        attention to arrest the potential for growing suspicion and alienation
                        between Europe and America.</p>
                    <p>—We do not accept the proposition that the strengthening of Atlantic unity
                        and the defining of a European personality are incompatible. The two
                        processes have reinforced each other from the outset and can continue to do
                        so now. The United States has repeatedly and explicitly welcomed the
                        European decision to create an independent identity in all dimensions,
                        political and economic. Indeed, we have long—and more consistently than many
                        Europeans—supported the goal of political cohesion.</p>
                    <p>—We have no intention of restricting Europe’s international role to regional
                        matters. From our perspective, European unification should enable Europe to
                        take on broader responsibilities for global peace that ultimately can only
                        contribute to the common interest. The American initiative was meant to mark
                        Europe’s new preeminence on the world scene as well as within the North
                        Atlantic community.</p>
                    <p>A comprehensive reexamination of all aspects of our relationship, economic,
                        political, and military, is imperative. It is a fact that our troops are in
                        Europe as a vital component of mutual defense. It is also a fact—indeed, a
                        truism—that political, military, and economic factors are each part of our
                        relationship. In our view, the affirmation of the pervasive nature of our
                        interdependence is not a device for blackmail. On the contrary, it is the
                        justification for conciliatory solutions. For the specialized concerns of
                        experts and technicians have a life of their own and a narrow national or
                        sectarian bias. The purpose of our initiative was to override these divisive
                        attitudes by committing the highest authority in each country to the
                        principle that our common and paramount interest is in broadly conceived
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The European Identity</p>
                    <p>Since last April Europe has made great strides toward unity—particularly in
                        political coordination. The United States strongly supports that process.
                        But as an old friend we are also sensitive to what this process does to
                        traditional ties that, in our view, remain essential to the common
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>Europe’s unity must not be at the expense of Atlantic community, or both
                        sides of the Atlantic will suffer. It is not that we are impatient <pb
                            n="123" facs="0154" xml:id="pg_123"/>with the cumbersome machinery of
                        the emerging Europe. It is rather the tendency to highlight division rather
                        than unity with us which concerns us.</p>
                    <p>I would be less than frank were I to conceal our uneasiness about some of the
                        recent practices of the European Community in the political field. To
                        present the decisions of a unifying Europe to us as faits accomplis not
                        subject to effective discussion is alien to the tradition of U.S.-European
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>This may seem a strange complaint from a country repeatedly accused of acting
                        itself without adequately consulting with its allies. There is no doubt that
                        the United States has sometimes not consulted enough or
                        adequately—especially in rapidly moving situations. But this is not a
                        preference; it is a deviation from official policy and established
                        practice—usually under pressure of necessity. The attitude of the unifying
                        Europe, by contrast, seems to attempt to elevate refusal to consult into a
                        principle defining European identity. To judge from recent experience,
                        consultation with us before a decision is precluded, and consultation after
                        the fact has been drained of content. For then Europe appoints a spokesman
                        who is empowered to inform us of the decisions taken but who has no
                        authority to negotiate.<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">Reference is to Danish

                    <p>We do not object to a single spokesman, but we do believe that as an old ally
                        the United States should be given an opportunity to express its concerns
                        before final decisions affecting its interests are taken. And bilateral
                        channels of discussion and negotiation should not be permitted to atrophy—at
                        least until European political unity is fully realized. To replace the
                        natural dialogue with extremely formalistic procedures would be to shatter
                        abruptly close and intangible ties of trust and communication that took
                        decades to develop and that have served our common purposes well.</p>
                    <p>The United States recognizes the problems of a transitional period as Europe
                        moves toward unity. We understand the difficulty of the first <pb n="124"

                        But we cannot be indifferent to the tendency to justify European identity as
                        facilitating separateness from the United States; European unity, in our
                        view, is not contradictory to Atlantic unity.</p>
                    <p>For our part, we will spare no effort to strengthen cooperative relationships
                        with a unifying Europe, to affirm the community of our ideals, and to
                        revitalize the Atlantic relationship. That was the purpose of our initiative
                        last April. It remains the central goal of our foreign policy.</p>

                    <p>The leaders of the European Community meet this week.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d24fn4">The <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> summit meeting
                            was held in Copenhagen December 14–15.</note> They will consider the
                        nature of European identity; no doubt they will adopt common policies and
                        positions. In the light of this important meeting, let me outline the
                        position of the United States:</p>
                    <p>—Détente is an imperative. In a world shadowed by the danger of nuclear
                        holocaust, there is no rational alternative to the pursuit of relaxation of
                        tensions. But we must take care that the pursuit of détente not undermine
                        the friendships which made détente possible.</p>
                    <p>—Common defense is a necessity. We must be prepared to adjust it to changing
                        conditions and share burdens equally. We need a definition of security that
                        our peoples can support and that our adversaries will respect in a period of
                        lessened tensions.</p>
                    <p>—European unity is a reality. The United States welcomes and supports it in
                        all its dimensions, political as well as economic. We believe it must be
                        made irreversible and that it must strengthen transatlantic ties.</p>
                    <p>—Economic interdependence is a fact. We must resolve the paradox of growing
                        mutual dependence and burgeoning national and regional identities.</p>
                    <p>We are determined to continue constructive dialogue with Western Europe. We
                        have offered no final answers; we welcome Europe’s wisdom. We believe that
                        this opportunity will not come soon again.</p>
                    <p>So let us rededicate ourselves to finishing the task of renewing the Atlantic
                        community.</p>
                    <p>First, let us complete the work before us; let us agree on a set of
                        declarations equal to the occasion so that they may serve as an agenda for
                        our governments and as an example and inspiration for our peoples.</p>
                    <pb n="125" facs="0156" xml:id="pg_125"/>
                    <p>Second, let us then transform these declarations into practical and
                        perceptible progress. We will restore mutual confidence if our policies
                        begin to reinforce rather than work against our common objectives. And let
                        us move quickly to improve the process of consultation in both directions.
                        The U.S. Government made concrete suggestions in this regard at the recent
                        meeting of the Foreign Ministers in the North Atlantic Council.</p>
                    <p>But let us also remember that even the best consultative machinery cannot
                        substitute for common vision and shared goals; it cannot replace the whole
                        network of intangible connections that have been the real sinews of the
                        transatlantic and especially the Anglo-American relationship. We must take
                        care lest in defining European unity in too legalistic a manner we lose what
                        has made our alliance unique: that in the deepest sense Europe and America
                        do not think of each other as foreign entities conducting traditional
                        diplomacy, but as members of a larger community engaged, sometimes painfully
                        but ultimately always cooperatively, in a common enterprise. The meeting to
                        which the Foreign Ministers of the Community were courteous enough to invite
                        me marks a significant step forward in restoring the intangibles of the
                        transatlantic dialogue.<note n="5" xml:id="d24fn5">

                        he did not stand up so firmly to challenges in crises around the
                        world—suddenly to sacrifice Western Europe’s security on the altar of
                        condominium. Our destiny, as well as the full strength of our military
                        power, is inextricably linked with yours.</p>
                    <p>As we look into the future we can perceive challenges compared to which our
                        recent disputes are trivial. A new international system is replacing the
                        structure of the immediate postwar years. The external policies of China and
                        the Soviet Union are in periods of transition. Western Europe is unifying.
                        New nations seek identity and an appropriate role. Even now, economic
                        relationships are changing more rapidly than the structures which nurtured
                        them. We—Europe, Canada, and America—have only two choices: creativity
                        together or irrelevance apart.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Middle East and Energy</p>
                    <p>The Middle East crisis illustrates the importance of distinguishing the
                        long-range from the ephemeral. The differences of recent months resulted not
                        so much from lack of consultation as from a different per<pb n="126"
                            facs="0157" xml:id="pg_126"/>ception of three key issues: Was the war
                        primarily a local conflict, or did it have wider significance? Has the
                        energy crisis been caused primarily by the war, or does it have deeper
                        causes? Can our common energy crisis be solved by anything but collective
                        action?</p>
                    <p>As for the nature of the Middle East conflict, it is fair to state—as many
                        Europeans including your Foreign Secretary have—that the United States did
                        not do all that it might have done before the war to promote a permanent
                        settlement in the Middle East. Once the war began, the United States
                        demonstrated great restraint until the Soviet effort reached the point of
                        massive intervention. Once that happened, it became a question of whether
                        the West would retain any influence to help shape the political future of an
                        area upon which Europe is even more vitally dependent than the United
                        States. We involved ourselves in a resupply effort not to take sides in the
                        conflict but to protect the possibility of pursuing after the war the
                        objective of a just, permanent settlement which some of our allies have
                        urged on us ever since 1967.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, we must bear in mind the deeper causes of the energy
                        crisis: It is not simply a product of the Arab-Israeli war; it is the
                        inevitable consequence of the explosive growth of worldwide demand
                        outrunning the incentives for supply. The Middle East war made a chronic
                        crisis acute, but a crisis was coming in any event. Even when prewar
                        production levels are resumed, the problem of matching the level of oil that
                        the world produces to the level which it consumes will remain.</p>
                    <p>The only long-term solution is a massive effort to provide producers an
                        incentive to increase their supply, to encourage consumers to use existing
                        supplies more rationally, and to develop alternate energy sources.</p>
                    <p>This is a challenge which the United States could solve alone with great
                        difficulty and that Europe cannot solve in isolation at all. We strongly
                        prefer, and Europe requires, a common enterprise.</p>
                    <p>To this end, the United States proposes that the nations of Europe, North
                        America, and Japan establish an Energy Action Group of senior and
                        prestigious individuals with a mandate to develop within three months an
                        initial action program for collaboration in all areas of the energy problem.
                        We would leave it to the members of the Nine whether they prefer to
                        participate as the European Community.</p>
                    <p>The Group would have as its goal the assurance of required energy supplies at
                        reasonable cost. It would define broad principles of cooperation, and it
                        would initiate action in specific areas:</p>
                    <p>—To conserve energy through more rational utilization of existing
                        supplies;</p>
                    <p>—To encourage the discovery and development of new sources of energy;</p>
                    <pb n="127" facs="0158" xml:id="pg_127"/>
                    <p>—To give producers an incentive to increase supply; and</p>
                    <p>—To coordinate an international program of research to develop new
                        technologies that use energy more efficiently and provide alternatives to
                        petroleum. The United States would be willing to contribute our particular
                        skills in such areas as the development of the deep seabed.</p>
                    <p>The Energy Action Group should not be an exclusive organization of consumers.
                        The producing nations should be invited to join it from the very beginning
                        with respect to any matters of common interest. The problem of finding
                        adequate opportunity for development, and the investment of the proceeds
                        from the sale of energy sources, would appear to be a particularly important
                        area for consumer-producer cooperation.</p>
                    <p>As an example of a task for the Energy Action Group, I would cite the field
                        of enriching uranium for use in nuclear power reactors. We know that our
                        need for this raw material will be great in the 1980’s. We know that
                        electric utilities will wish to assure their supply at the least possible
                        cost. We know that European countries and Japan will wish to have their own
                        facilities to produce at least part of their needs for enriched uranium.
                        Such plants require huge capital investment. What could be more sensible
                        than that we plan together to assure that scarce resources are not wasted by
                        needless duplication?</p>
                    <p>The United States is prepared to make a very major financial and intellectual
                        contribution to the objective of solving the energy problem on a common
                        basis. There is no technological problem that the great democracies do not
                        have the capacity to solve together—if they can muster the will and the
                        imagination. The energy crisis of 1973 can become the economic equivalent of
                        the sputnik challenge of 1957. The outcome can be the same. Only this time,
                        the giant step for mankind will be one that America and its closest partners
                        take together for the benefit of all mankind.</p>
                    <p>We have every reason of duty and self-interest to preserve the most
                        successful partnership in history. The United States is committed to making
                        the Atlantic community a vital positive force for the future as it was for
                        the past. What has recently been taken for granted must now be renewed. This
                        is not an American challenge to Europe; it is history’s challenge to us
                        all.</p>
                    <p>The United Kingdom, we believe, is in a unique position. We welcome your
                        membership in the European Community—though the loosening of some of our old
                        ties has been painful at times. But you can make another historic
                        contribution in helping develop between the United States and a unifying
                        Europe the same special confidence and intimacy that benefited our two
                        nations for decades. We are prepared to offer a unifying Europe a “special
                        relationship,” for we believe that <pb n="128" facs="0159" xml:id="pg_128"
                        />the unity of the Western world is essential for the well-being of all its
                        parts.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Israeli Government
                        has to make a decision—if they want to make the decision. My prognosis of
                        the disengagement talks is they will not be significantly affected, I
                        think.</p>
                    <p>Toth: What about oil? I don’t want to speculate.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is obviously some
                        relationship. There is a good chance of progress, I mean mostly agreed, or
                        agreed.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: When would they begin disengagement?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I can’t tell how long
                        that would take technically. It’s a separation of forces, not a return to
                        the 1967 lines.</p>
                    <p>Toth: It sets the stage for settlement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is deep background:
                        It will start a process, but they don’t necessarily commit themselves to
                        ultimate frontiers. It also avoids a discussion of final borders and the
                        more intractable issues. Conceptually it is doable. The Israelis started it
                        at Kilometer 101. It creates a framework in which resumption of hostilities
                        is at least technically more difficult.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: Will the oil embargo be lifted?</p>
                    <pb n="130" facs="0161" xml:id="pg_130"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There are two problems.
                        There would have been a shortage anyway. Then there came the cut in
                        production. Lifting the embargo by itself doesn’t help us if the production
                        level isn’t raised. So the production level increase helped us. We hope it
                        will be lifted—but I will not speculate on it.</p>
                    <p>Brokaw: The timing of the talks is affected by the need to put together a new
                        government?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think they can do
                        disengagement without a government, but no further than that.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: She says she might call a new election.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Really? But there is not
                        a clear-cut mandate against negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Kalb: Disengagement would be visible?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is conceivable that
                        the Egyptians would remain on the East Bank but the Israelis would cross to
                        the East Bank. It would be visible separation.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: What is the Egyptian Government attitude?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Egypt is flexible, as
                        shown by its giving up on the October 22 lines.</p>
                    <p>Fisher: What is the Soviet attitude?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Since the alert, and up
                        to now, it has been constructive. They haven’t done anything—but there has
                        been no obstruction. I don’t think the Soviets knew the Syrians wouldn’t go
                        to the Conference until I was there.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: They can’t control their clients!</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They are not their
                        clients.</p>
                    <p>About oil. We don’t want to establish the relationship directly, because we
                        don’t want to be a principal party to the negotiations. On the other hand,
                        our situation has been eased since we started our activity.</p>
                    <p>Toth: Is it the Egyptian strategy to keep Israel mobilized?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Whether it is their
                        strategy, I don’t know. But the war was a dramatic blow to Israel. While
                        they won a victory, it was not as politically useful—it was not a crushing
                        supremacy—and it didn’t solve their military problem. It brought about a
                        worldwide coalition against them, and it set in train military events by
                        which they can be bled. These are the analytical facts. It has nothing to do
                        with our pressures or recommendations.</p>
                    <p>Apple: It was a tactical victory, but a strategic defeat.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is a cliché that we
                        do better with our enemies. With Europe we could do the declarations
                        overnight if we wanted. <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> did okay.
                        What bothers us on the <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> one is that they
                        want an indivisible defense but won’t use the word “partnership”. Is this
                            be<pb n="131" facs="0162" xml:id="pg_131"/>cause they are democracies or
                        because of some more fundamental difficulty? There is some organic
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Fisher: What organic problems?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: On deep background—they
                        are weak governments, with a left to placate. They like to dissociate
                        themselves from us; on the other hand they like our military protection. In
                        the long run this is untenable. You get these Common Market meetings under
                        the French leadership with no opposition.</p>
                    <p>We could finish respectable declarations. Where the declaration got off the
                        rails was when the Common Market started dealing with itself exclusively. We
                        wanted some symbolic creative act. The Shanghai Communiqué<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d25fn6">See <ref target="#d3fn5">footnote 5, Document
                            3</ref>.</note> looks great but it doesn’t say much. Read my April

                            <ref target="#d8">Document 8</ref>.</note> we offered a common détente
                        policy. But they’re torn—they want European unity.</p>
                    <p>On the energy proposal,<note n="8" xml:id="d25fn8">See <ref target="#d24"
                                >Document 24</ref>.</note> I think something will happen on it. Read
                        the Marshall Plan speech—it is not a great speech, but it was made a great
                        event by enthusiasm and participation. We spent more time with the Europeans
                        this year than any other. It is time-consuming. But on the declarations, we
                        want to see whether we can get something more substantial.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: It seems that a meaningful declaration is further away than
                        ever.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: A meaningful declaration
                        is here; but a meaningful policy is hard. I think the difficulty is theirs.
                        We have offered them cooperation. What pressures are we putting on them?
                        None.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: We are trying to include Japan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, Japan is a fact. It
                        is inconceivable to have a structure created that doesn’t include Japan. It
                        doesn’t have to be the same declaration. But the Europeans want bilateral
                        declarations. But it is very dangerous to set up competition between Europe
                        and the U.S. for Japan—and the Japanese don’t want it.</p>
                    <p>Apple: Are you saying that the Europeans need a little more time to sort out
                        what they want to do and be?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It may turn out.</p>
                    <p>Kalb: Do we want a common policy?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: A common discussion.
                        Let’s discuss détente, military questions. The issues <gloss
                            target="#t_JFK_1">JFK</gloss> raised in 1962 are still not solved. The

                        beautiful scenery; 90 days’ supply is imaginary. We didn’t invent this.</p>
                    <p>On economics, it is imperative to work out a strategy to replace a strategy
                        originated when the preoccupation was the gap. Take the energy crisis—it
                        creates a totally new situation. Do we deal competitively or cooperatively?
                        It is a common problem. All we mean is to discuss the range of individual
                        action. We might disagree, but we haven’t even got to the discussions.</p>
                    <p>Toth: What about the President’s trip?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We could have a trip
                        within any four-week period. But we didn’t want a trip until we got
                        something. My estimate is it could be at the latest by mid-April.</p>
                    <p>Apple: He would go then?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I could get them in shape
                        by February if the President wanted. There is no date set.</p>
                    <p>Toth: Then you would go on to Japan?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is conceivable but it
                        has not been formally considered.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: What about Congress?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The former doves may

                            >Mansfield</persName> will stick to his position. But my instinct is it
                        will be easier to beat than ever. The moderate Democrats (<persName
                            corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName>, Kennedy, etc.) will move closer

                    <p>I had a study of the editorials on East-West trade for four and one-half
                        years. We were always attacked for going too slow on East-West trade and for
                        attaching political conditions!</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It makes no difference to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MMJ_1">Mansfield</persName>. In my press
                        conference last week<note n="9" xml:id="d25fn9">December 27, 1973. See
                            Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> January 21, 1974,
                            pp. 45–56.</note>—I found that I can’t be as analytical as Secretary of
                        State. My remarks were misinterpreted. I think there can be progress on
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> for the Summit. <gloss
                            target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> can’t be at the Summit because it is a
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact exercise. In
                        negotiations, the opening positions are absurd because they take account of
                        one’s own side’s necessities. But gradually you discover the other’s real
                        positions. Then you need a breakthrough like May 1971 in <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. We are at this stage in <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. We need a conceptual breakthrough to
                        decide what is going to happen. Then the technical details come up—but they
                        can be done fast. For example, in January 1972 there was a discussion of
                        silo dimensions; the substantive issues were settled in six weeks. Within
                        two months, we can get a conceptual breakthrough. If we do this, then we can
                        get sub<pb n="133" facs="0164" xml:id="pg_133"/>stantial progress by the
                        Summit—an agreement or part of an agreement.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: When will it be?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is not set.</p>
                    <p>Toth: Can the President travel abroad when there is the prospect of
                        impeachment?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: While he is President he
                        should act as President.</p>
                    <p>Toth: But after the House votes?</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: We could have a vote by April 1.</p>

                        would say the President had no legitimacy to commit the U.S. to close
                        Atlantic ties. If it were a divisive issue, that would be different.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: What about <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>?</p>

                        realignment going on. You tell me what we gave up in <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>–I that we didn’t already give up.</p>
                    <p>Brokaw: What impact would impeachment proceedings have on this diplomacy?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: None. Maybe down the
                        road. But none now.</p>
                    <p>Kalb: You expect a trip by April?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The chances are three out
                        of five that he might. There is no planning. But the chances are a little
                        better than fifty-fifty.</p>
                    <p>Fisher: What about the trip to the Soviet Union?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He <hi rend="italic"
                            >will</hi> go to the Soviet Union. Japan might be—but we had not thought
                        of it. To Europe—the chances are better than 50–50 he will go by the end of
                        April.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: Is there any chance Chou might come here? Or is Taiwan blocking
                        it?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No. He has a very complex
                        domestic situation. No one knows who is the target of the 1974
                        anti-Confucian campaign.</p>
                    <p>The Taiwan question is no obstacle to the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> relations at this
                        moment.</p>
                    <p>Kalb: What about Vietnam?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is slightly less
                        than a fifty-fifty chance they will start an attack. I used to think the
                        chances were more than fifty-fifty.</p>
                    <p>Toth: How about Thieu’s blast at the elections?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think both sides have
                        given up on the political agreement.</p>
                    <p>Toth: This would imply a political struggle.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Or partition, de
                        facto.</p>
                    <p>If there were an offensive in April or May, I wouldn’t be astonished.</p>

                    <p>Fisher: Has your relationship changed with the President since you became
                        Secretary of State?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The modus operandi is
                        almost exactly the same, but it is more visible.</p>
                    <p>Pierpoint: Some in the White House said you didn’t communicate as often as
                        before, on this trip.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Who told you that? Only
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAMJ_1">Haig</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName> know. I sent a full report every
                        day. I see him automatically every day for a half hour, usually more. Before
                        the trip we consult; we know where I’m going. On the way I don’t need
                        detailed instructions. I talk to <persName corresp="#p_HAMJ_1"
                            >Haig</persName> and get the Presidential mood of things—what he’s
                        worried about—and operational things with <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1"
                            >Scowcroft</persName>. These stories are totally wrong.</p>
                    <p>Toth: You have less input now in the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>
                        budget because you are traveling.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Over the years, the
                        military systematically attempted to undercut any outside inputs. This year
                        I have had more conceptual input by meeting with <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> for breakfast, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1"
                            >Colby</persName>. These are less formal meetings, but the formal
                        meetings degenerated into idiot briefings. There is more input now, but we
                        haven’t solved how we can get a real strategic doctrine for the United
                        States. Looking at the costs, the pressures in the military for weapons of
                        increased technological flexibility. This is the big problem.</p>
                    <p>Toth: The President had two meetings with the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1"
                            >JCS</gloss>, and <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>,

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: This is the first
                        National Security Council meeting of the new year. For your planning
                        purposes, I would like to plan on a formal <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> meeting once every thirty days. Of course, I will carry out
                        all kinds of consultation—with Henry, <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                            >Schlesinger</persName>, and others—which will affect policy in addition
                        to the formal meetings. But we have an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        system which we’re proud of and which I intend to use. In this light, I
                        would like you to note that although he is Secretary of State, Henry is
                        sitting in this meeting as Assistant to the President. So at this meeting,
                            <persName corresp="#p_RKW_1">Ken (Rush)</persName> will have to speak
                        for State.</p>
                    <p>I want these monthly meetings because there is a need for regularity. Last

                            facs="0167" xml:id="pg_136"/>been. In the first year or two we were
                        setting basic policy—considering <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>’s
                        and meeting on other topics. Now we are more in the process of executing
                        policy. Nonetheless, there are a number of areas we have to take a look
                        at—Latin America, Africa, Europe. Of course, there are limits to how much
                        time we can devote to some of these. <persName corresp="#p_MMJ_1">Mike
                            Mansfield</persName> said to me this morning that he hoped I would

                        through if I covered them all in detail. Nevertheless, I believe it is very
                        important, particularly in the second term of an administration, not to be
                        like an exhausted volcano—there’s a continual need to re-evaluate policy and
                        positions.</p>
                    <p>In my first term our major foreign policy accomplishment was certainly the
                        Vietnam War. Not that it would not have ended eventually in any event—it had
                        to end. But we had to take many tough decisions—Cambodia, Laos, May 8,
                        December 18. History might record that our opening to China was the most
                        important accomplishment, or perhaps our opening to the Soviet Union. Yet,
                        had we not done Southeast Asia properly, the others would not have been
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>When you have ideas I want you to throw them in. This applies to the Deputies
                        as well; I consider you as much a part of this group as the Principals. I
                        heard a good idea today from my daughter, Julie. Julie is a good friend of
                        former Agriculture Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCM_1">Hardin</persName>.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCM_1">Hardin</persName> said, “He who holds
                        the oil of the world, holds the world by the tail.” Julie also made a point
                        of her own, that food is tremendously important. Whoever can feed himself
                        will be in an excellent position. Food can be even more important than
                        energy, and if there’s anything we’re good at, it’s agriculture. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BEL_1">Butz</persName> was just telling me about
                        the excellent crops we’re going to have. As you might expect, the lure of $5
                        wheat leads to tremendous plantings and will be leading to surpluses once
                        again. Back to foreign affairs, our role will not be limited only to the
                        U.S., but also to what we can contribute to the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>I remember an incident in Latin America many years ago. All the leaders I met
                        then have either died or have been assassinated by now, so I can’t remember
                        the names. But whoever I was speaking to was the head of Peru at that time.
                        I told him we could send our experts to improve his agricultural technology.
                        But he said, “That’s not our problem—our problem is that 45 percent of our
                        food spoils on its way to market.” That’s what is so great about the United
                        States—we not only have the agricultural technology, but we know how to
                        store and transport and market the food we produce.</p>

                    <p>Another example is Brazil. Brazil is an unbelievably rich country. When
                        Kubitschek put the capital out there in Brazilia,<note n="3" xml:id="d26fn3"

                        was a damn fool. But he was brilliant; the heart of Latin America is in its

                        In our foreign policy, I don’t want to export our farmers, but one of the
                        most important exports we have is know-how—not just planting and growing,
                        but transporting and marketing also.</p>
                    <p>Having started in so idealistically, which I’m not sure you’ll pay much
                        attention to in any event, I will now turn to other topics.</p>
                    <p>Jerry, since this is your first meeting, I would like to say a little bit
                        about how we operate. We do not make decisions here. I have to make the
                        decisions, and I make them after the meeting. Sometimes I change my mind, so
                        please don’t hold me to any comments I might make here. I want to emphasize
                        once again the importance of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        operation here in the White House. It’s important to understand that when
                        you talk to Henry or <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>,
                        you’re talking to me. We have big plays left to make. It’s like Joe
                        DiMaggio—I remember his marvelous plays. He nearly busted his ankle every
                        time, but he would always catch the ball. He was expected to make big plays.
                        It’s expected now that we make big plays. And even if there might not be
                        many big plays left to make, there are certainly big mistakes which can be
                        made. Therefore, we have to use this process. What happens here in this room
                        is still more important than what happens anywhere else in the world. Not
                        because of the personalities involved, but because of the richness of our
                        country, and because we have power and have shown our willingness to use
                        power. When we sneeze, everyone else gets pneumonia, and that’s the way it’s
                        going to be for a while—unless we decide to give up our power and retreat
                        into ourselves.</p>
                    <p>That’s the end of my introductory remarks for this first meeting. Let me say
                        once again that if you think our policies are wrong, please say so. Of
                        course, if you think the policies are right, say it publicly! We’ve met
                        today to talk about <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, and I hope these
                        meetings can be essentially one-topic meetings. My understanding is that
                        there is a wide difference of opinion on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> around town, which just goes to show that the more things
                        change, the more they stay the same. Let’s start now with a briefing from
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="138" facs="0169" xml:id="pg_138"/>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>.]</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: This is certainly
                        more complex than <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I. It is also true
                        that they have a better bargaining position than we do. We talk as if we can
                        have an agreement or not, but within this room, we shouldn’t fool
                        ourselves—we probably aren’t fooling them either.</p>
                    <p>Suppose <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> wants to agree, but
                        his military does not. Their military may decide to go like hell. The U.S.
                        might also wish to agree, and our military, while supporting an agreement,
                        might think that a particular agreement is lousy. But we have to look at the
                        political situation. Despite the fact that we could steam the country up in
                        the absence of agreement, and tell them that we are in an all-out arms race,
                        it is far more likely that the Soviets will move ahead more rapidly than we
                        will.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1"
                            >Johnson</persName>: But the Soviets must account for the
                        unpredictability of our reaction. They cannot assume we will do nothing.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: That is right. We
                        could turn hard right. Even some of the extreme peaceniks who two years ago
                        said that we must have détente at any price are for political reasons now
                        saying that détente is bad. But I don’t mind <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1"
                            >Jackson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName>
                        rattling around like they do. In the back of their minds the Soviets know
                        that we might turn to the right.</p>
                    <p>But we should look at the hard facts. We are putting in a bigger Defense
                        budget, and maybe we’ll get it; but it may be substantially cut. What we
                        have to figure on here is this—we talk about essential equivalence and other
                        such gobbledegook, but suppose we can’t get it. Looking at the two
                        countries, lacking an agreement, and having an all-out arms race. We just
                        might not get the new programs from Congress. Especially when 56 percent of
                        our budget is spent on personnel versus 26 percent of theirs.</p>
                    <p>I don’t mean to be telling our chief negotiator that we are in a weak
                        position. We have got to go all out to get the agreement. But when you have
                        your Verification Panel and when we make these decisions, we have got to
                        realize that an all-out arms race may not be to our advantage.</p>
                    <p>Let me raise another strategic concept. We talk about the Soviet Union and
                        the U.S., but by 1980 the Soviet Union will face Britain and France, who
                        don’t have much, and potentially a very substantial China. For the U.S., we
                        talk about planning for a two-ocean war or a one-ocean war. But at present,
                        the threat from the Chinese is obviously considerably less. And Western
                        Europe is no threat to us. For the Soviet Union it is not as easy—they have
                        to worry about the U.S. first, but also Western Europe, which may matter at
                        some point in the future, and the Chinese. Thus, central to our policy is
                        what happens in China. Suppose there <pb n="139" facs="0170" xml:id="pg_139"
                        />were a Soviet-Chinese détente or alliance. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_JW_1"

                            redistricting, <persName corresp="#p_JW_1">Judd</persName> eventually
                            assumed the chairmanship of the Committee for a Free China.</note> was
                        unhappy with our opening to China and I was not terribly happy about what it
                        did to our friends in Taiwan. Also, we can’t forget that it was not an
                        anti-Soviet move—at least that is what we say; we see good relations with
                        both sides.</p>
                    <p>And without that, the U.S. ten years from now would be in a very dangerous
                        position. Within ten years, as <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> says, or within twenty to twenty-five years, it
                        will happen—the Chinese will be very strong.</p>

                        They could be a significant threat to the Soviets within ten years, although
                        it might be twenty years before they were a threat to the U.S.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: I remember when we
                        were in Moscow for <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>—I must say I never
                        went through such a week—our Russian friends do their business after
                        midnight, right, Henry? During the Middle East negotiations at the last
                        summit, Henry, as you remember, most of our conversations were between
                        midnight and 3:00 a.m. In <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I,
                        everything was after midnight and went on all night long—at least that is
                        what you said you were doing (laughter).</p>
                    <p>In a group of experts like this, this probably sounds poor, but I think we
                        have to keep asking ourselves—why do we have it? What is it going to be
                        worth ten years from now?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>—he showers love and kisses
                        on the U.S.—and bear hugs—he is a very physical man. But, when I saw him
                        alone both here and at San Clemente, all he talked about was China. It might
                        be an act, but it could be very real. If it is an act, he is the best actor
                        in the world.</p>

                        looking at this not in terms of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II,
                        but ten years from now. They are thinking, as they always do, in historical
                        terms. They know that the Chinese and the U.S., while not friends, are not
                        opponents. So, in the long term, they have to think in terms of a much
                        larger force. Today it is just the Soviet Union versus the U.S., but their
                        worry is 1985. Alex, what do they say about the Chinese question?</p>

                        conversations, although they frequently talk about “third powers.”</p>
                    <pb n="140" facs="0171" xml:id="pg_140"/>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Yes, they refer to
                        “those powers,” but they clearly aren’t interested in India or Ceylon—they
                        mean the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: If there is no
                        agreement, we clearly have the resources and the know-how, but perhaps not
                        the political will. I assume they have the will and the know-how, but do
                        they have the resources?</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Sure. We always have
                        underestimated them—they have plenty of resources.</p>
                    <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: However, they do have
                        an incentive to agree. <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> has
                        his entire reputation tied up in this, and also there are others behind him
                        who are looking at the economic advantages of détente.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Yes, <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> has staked a great deal on
                        agreements with the U.S. Stalin killed everyone off, perhaps for pretty good
                        reason, since they were out to get him—but we should remember, in the final
                        analysis, because of the authoritarian character of their system, that it is
                        in our interest to have a government in the Soviet Union as peaceful as
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> seems to be now, even
                        though they are being very tough in these negotiations. It could be a lot
                        worse.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: I agree as
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Bill Colby</persName> has pointed out that
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> has an interest in
                        agreement. Therefore, I think we can arrive at least at “formal” equality
                        which will allow us to build up to a level equal to theirs. We might not get
                        the funds to do it, but I think it is important for appearance’s sake to
                        have formal equality. We might have to accept their level of forces. But
                        then, the pressure is on Congress to provide the essential equivalence they
                        insist we must have. Today we spend only $8 billion on strategic forces—we
                        probably spend that much on food stamps.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: A lousy program.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: We could go up
                        easily. They have an incentive to avoid a U.S. build-up.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Don’t misunderstand
                        me. Our public position will have to be that we have the will, and will
                        undertake the necessary programs. We don’t need agreement if they don’t want
                        it. But in this room, we have to look realistically at a world where we go
                        up and up. It is not clear such a world is in our interest. I don’t mind
                        sounding like a peacenik here in this room—but I hope it doesn’t get
                        outside.</p>
                    <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Jim, are you
                        saying we only spend about 10 percent of our budget on strategic forces?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: About 10 to 15
                        percent. We are spending less now than we were in 1964 in constant dollar
                        terms. And with about $2 billion a year more we could undertake significant
                        new programs.</p>

                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_ZERJ_1">Zumwalt</persName>: Two billion dollars
                        would buy two more submarines a year.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName

                        (laughter)!</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clements: The point is, it is relatively cheap to go up if we have

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: We will try to do it
                        if we have to, but hopefully we will be able to get agreement with the
                        Soviets. Thank you very much, gentlemen.</p>

                    <p>The severity of the global energy crisis in late 1973 prompted the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration to engage other
                        nations in a search for solutions. Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName> used his December 12,
                        1973, speech to the Society of Pilgrims in London (<ref target="#d24"
                            >Document 24</ref>) to propose the establishment of an Energy Action
                        Group, with members comprised of oil-consuming and oil-producing countries.
                        Concerned that the energy situation jeopardized global political and
                        economic stability, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> invited
                        all major industrial consumer and producer nations to meet at the Foreign
                        Minister level in Washington during the second week of February 1974 to
                        analyze the current situation and develop a consumer action program. For the

                    <p>On January 10, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and
                        Administrator of the Federal Energy Office <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"
                            >William Simon</persName> held a joint press conference at the
                        Department of State to discuss the foreign and domestic implications of the
                        energy crisis. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> sketched
                        out the parameters of the upcoming meeting and added: “The basic conviction
                        of the President and of his associates is that it is a problem of truly
                        global significance in which selfish advantages cannot be attained, or if
                        attained, cannot be sustained, either among consuming nations or between
                        consuming and producing nations. It is in this spirit that the United States
                        will make its proposals, first at the meeting on February 11, and at the
                        subsequent meetings that will, we hope, flow from that. And it will be in a
                        spirit that we are con<pb n="142" facs="0173" xml:id="pg_142"/>structing a
                        solution for all of mankind, and not of particular benefit to any one
                        segment of it, that the President has addressed both the consuming and the
                        producing nations to start a process which we hope will provide long-term
                        answers to the problem of supply as well as to the problems of the economy.”

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> subsequently used his January
                        19 radio address to review the energy conservation measures undertaken by
                        Americans during the 1973 Arab oil embargo and to highlight the
                        administration’s efforts in pursuing international accommodation on oil
                        supplies and prices. Reiterating the severity of the crisis, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> commented: “The burden of energy
                        conservation, of cutbacks and inconvenience, of occasional discomfort,
                        continued concern is not, I can assure you, an artificial one. It is real.
                        During the Second World War, Winston Churchill was once asked why England
                        was fighting Hitler. He answered, ‘If we stop, you will find out.’” (<hi

                    <p>Four days later, on January 23, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                        submitted to Congress his first legislative message of 1974, which
                        delineated the administration’s short-term and long-term legislative
                        proposals concerning the energy crisis. For the text of this message, see
                        ibid., pages 17–32. The President also devoted a portion of his State of the
                        Union message to underscoring the importance of these legislative
                        initiatives and the necessity for cooperation at the upcoming Washington
                        Energy Conference: “As we seek to act domestically to increase fuel
                        supplies, we will act internationally in an effort to obtain oil at
                        reasonable prices. Unreasonable increases in the cost of so vital a
                        commodity as oil poses a threat to the entire structure of international
                        economic relations. Not only U.S. jobs, prices and incomes are at stake, but
                        the general pattern of international cooperation is at stake as well. It is
                        our hope that we can work out cooperative efforts with our friends abroad so
                        that we can all meet our energy needs without disrupting our economies and
                        without disrupting our economic relationships.” (Ibid., page 58)</p>
                    <p>The Washington Energy Conference commenced on February 11. In his opening
                        remarks to conference delegates, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> asserted: “The United States has called this
                        conference for one central purpose: to move urgently to resolve the energy
                        problem on the basis of cooperation among <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                        nations. Failure to do so would threaten the world with a vicious cycle of
                        competition, autarky, rivalry, and depression such as led to the collapse of
                        the world order in the thirties. Fortunately, the problem is still
                        manageable multilaterally: National policies are still evolving, practical
                        solutions to the energy problem are technically achievable, and cooperation
                        with the producing countries is still politically open to us.” After
                        outlining seven potential areas of collaboration, including promulgation of
                        a “new energy ethic,” development of alter<pb n="143" facs="0174"
                            xml:id="pg_143"/>native energy sources, funding of energy research and
                        development, institution of a multilateral energy sharing program, increased
                        international financial cooperation, consideration of the needs of
                        developing nations, and improved consumer-producer relations, <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> ended his remarks, stating:</p>
                    <p>“As we look toward the end of this century, we know that the energy crisis
                        indicates the birth pains of global interdependence. Our response could well
                        determine our capacity to deal with the international agenda of the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>“We confront a fundamental decision. Will we consume ourselves in
                        nationalistic rivalry which the realities of interdependence make suicidal?
                        Or will we acknowledge our interdependence and shape cooperative
                        solutions?</p>
                    <p>“Our choice is clear, our responsibility compelling: We must demonstrate to
                        future generations that our vision was equal to our challenge.” (Department
                        of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, March 4, 1974, pages 201–206)</p>
                    <p>That evening, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> delivered
                        prepared remarks at a working dinner for conference delegates. Preferring to
                        place the energy crisis in a broader context of global politics, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> commented that the United States and
                        other nations had reached a watershed in world history. New challenges, such
                        as energy dependence, confronted the world’s leaders, leading <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> to pose the question as to how the
                        assembled leaders could secure peace in order to build an “era of progress
                        for all of our people, the people of the free nations and, for that matter,
                        of the Communist nations of the world.” The President referenced the insular
                        sentiment within the United States, not simply relating to security matters
                        but also to trade and international monetary policy. He asserted that his
                        administration would not disengage from the world: “We reject it
                        [withdrawal], for example, in the field of trade. We believe that it is
                        vitally important to go forward with the great trade initiatives that have
                        been undertaken, as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                        has often stated in his meetings with his counterparts represented here at
                        this meeting.</p>
                    <p>“We believe it is vitally important in the field of monetary affairs that the
                        United States play a responsible role with other nations in the free world
                        in developing a more stable system, one that will not be affected by the
                        shocks that have so often, over the past 10 years, shaken the world monetary
                        institutions to their very foundations.”</p>
                    <p>“We also believe this in terms of security, as I have already indicated,
                        where we oppose the idea that the United States, because we have entered
                        into a period of peace which we long wanted, now can reduce its forces
                        unilaterally without having a compensatory reduction among others or where
                        the United States will turn away from the treaty commitments that it has,

                    <p>We owe our host country and its leaders a profound debt of gratitude for
                        sponsoring this meeting. Personally, I have spent many happy days in this
                        great country. And I have had the privilege of the advice, wisdom, and on
                        occasion the tenacious opposition of your President and Foreign Minister. I
                        look forward to an equally frank, friendly, intense, but constructive
                        dialogue at this conference.</p>
                    <p>On a plaque in Mexico’s imposing Museum of Anthropology are etched phrases
                        which carry special meaning for this occasion:</p>
                    <p>Nations find courage and confidence to face the future looking to the
                        greatness of their past. Mexican, seek yourself in the mirror of this
                        greatness. Stranger, confirm here the unity of human destiny. Civilizations
                        pass; but we will always reflect the glory of the struggle to build
                        them.</p>
                    <p>We assemble in the splendid shadows of history’s monuments. They remind us of
                        what can be achieved by inspiration and of what can be lost when peoples
                        miss their opportunity. We in the Americas now have a great opportunity to
                        vindicate our old dream of building a new <pb n="145" facs="0176"
                            xml:id="pg_145"/>world of justice and peace, to assure the well-being of
                        our peoples, and to leave what we achieve as a monument to our striving.</p>
                    <p>Our common impulse in meeting here is to fulfill the promise of America as
                        the continent which beckoned men to fulfill what was best in them. Our
                        common reality is the recognition of our diversity. Our common determination
                        is to derive strength from that diversity. Our common task is to forge our
                        historical and geographical links into shared purpose and endeavor.</p>
                    <p>In this spirit the United States offered a new dialogue last October. In this
                        spirit the countries of the Americas responded in Bogotá last November.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">The Foreign Ministers and special representatives
                            of 23 Latin American countries met in Bogota November 14–16, 1973, and
                            proposed that the Tlatelolco Conference focus on development
                            cooperation, economic coercion measures, restructuring of the
                            Inter-American system, settlement of the Panama Canal question, the
                            structure of international trade and the international monetary system,
                            transnational enterprises, technology transfers, and the general outlook

                    </p>
                    <p>We meet here as equals—representatives of our individual modes of life, but
                        united by one aspiration: to build a new community.</p>
                    <p>We have a historic foundation on which to build. We live in a world that
                        gives our enterprise a special meaning and urgency.</p>
                    <p>On behalf of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>, I
                        commit the United States to undertake this venture with dedication and
                        energy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The U.S. Commitment</p>
                    <p>One concern has dominated all others as I have met privately with some of my
                        colleagues in this room. Does the United States really care? Is this another
                        exercise of high-sounding declarations followed by long periods of neglect?
                        What is new in this dialogue?</p>
                    <p>These questions—not unrelated to historical experience—define our task. On
                        behalf of my colleagues and myself, let me stress that we are here to give
                        effect to a new attitude and to help shape a new policy. The presence of so
                        many distinguished leaders from the U.S. Congress underlines the depth of
                        the U.S. concern for its neighbors and the determination of our government
                        to implement our agreements through a partnership between the executive and
                        legislative branches.</p>
                    <p>The time has come to infuse the Western Hemisphere relationships with a new
                        spirit. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States declared
                        what those outside this hemisphere should not do within it. In the 1930’s we
                        stipulated what the United States would not do. Later we were prone to set
                        standards for the political, economic, and social structures of our sister
                        republics.</p>
                    <pb n="146" facs="0177" xml:id="pg_146"/>
                    <p>Today we meet on the basis of your agenda and our common needs. We agree with
                        one of my distinguished colleagues who said on arrival that the time had
                        come to meet as brothers, not as sons. Today, together, we can begin giving
                        expression to our common aspirations and start shaping our common
                        future.</p>
                    <p>In my view, our fundamental task at this meeting, more important even than
                        the specifics of our agenda, is to set a common direction and infuse our
                        efforts with new purpose. Let us therefore avoid both condescension and
                        confrontation. If the United States is not to presume to supply all the
                        answers, neither should it be asked to bear all the responsibilities. Let us
                        together bring about a new commitment to the inter-American community. Let
                        us use the specific issues we discuss here as a roadmap for the future.</p>
                    <p>Let us not be satisfied with proclamations but chart a program of work worthy
                        of the challenge before us.</p>
                    <p>Let us create a new spirit in our relations—the spirit of Tlatelolco.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">An Interdependent World</p>
                    <p>A century ago a U.S. President described to the Congress the difficulties
                        facing the country: “It is a condition which confronts us—not a theory.” The
                        condition we confront today is a world where interdependence is a fact, not
                        a choice.</p>
                    <p>The products of man’s technical genius—weapons of incalculable power, a
                        global economic system, instantaneous communications, a technology that
                        consumes finite resources at an ever-expanding rate—have compressed this
                        planet and multiplied our mutual dependence. The problems of peace, of
                        justice, of human dignity, of hunger and inflation and pollution, of the
                        scarcity of physical materials and the surplus of spiritual despair, cannot
                        be resolved on a national basis. All are now caught up in the tides of world
                        events—consumers and producers, the affluent and the poor, the free and the
                        oppressed, the mighty and the weak.</p>
                    <p>The world and this hemisphere can respond in one of two ways:</p>
                    <p>There is the path of autarky. Each nation can try to exploit its particular
                        advantages in resources and skills and bargain bilaterally for what it
                        needs. Each nation can try to look after itself and shrug its shoulders at
                        the plight of those less well endowed. But history tells us that this leads
                        to ever more vicious competition, the waste of resources, the stunting of
                        technological advance, and most fundamentally, growing political tensions
                        which unravel the fabric of global stability. If we take this route, we and
                        our children will pay a terrible price.</p>
                    <p>Or we can take the path of collaboration. Nations can recognize that only in
                        working with others can they most effectively work for <pb n="147"
                            facs="0178" xml:id="pg_147"/>themselves. A cooperative world reflects
                        the imperatives of technical and economic necessity but, above all, the
                        sweep of human aspirations.</p>
                    <p>The United States is pledged to this second course. We believe that we of the
                        Americas should undertake it together.</p>
                    <p>This hemisphere is a reflection of mankind. Its diversity reflects the
                        diversity of the globe. It knows the afflictions and frustrations of the
                        impoverished. At the same time many of its members are leaders among
                        modernizing societies. Much has been done to overcome high mortality rates,
                        widespread illiteracy, and grinding poverty. This hemisphere uniquely
                        includes the perceptions of the postindustrial societies, of those who are
                        only beginning to sample the benefits of modernization, and of those who are
                        in mid-passage.</p>
                    <p>The Americas reach out to other constellations as well. The nations of Latin
                        America and the Caribbean share much of the stirrings of the Third World.
                        The United States is engaged in the maintenance of peace on a global basis.
                        Pursuing our separate ways narrowly, we could drift apart toward different
                        poles. Working together, we can reinforce our well-being and strengthen the
                        prospects for global cooperation.</p>
                    <p>So let us begin here in this hemisphere. If we here in this room fail to
                        grasp the consequences of interdependence, if we cannot make the
                        multiplicity of our ties a source of unity and strength, then the prospects
                        for success elsewhere are dim indeed. The world community which we seek to
                        build should have a Western Hemisphere community as one of its central
                        pillars.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EL_1">Echeverría</persName> foresaw the
                        gathering force of interdependence in 1972 when he set forth his Charter of
                        the Economic Rights and Duties of States<note n="3" xml:id="d28fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d17fn5">footnote 5, Document 17</ref>.</note> as a guide
                        for the conduct of relations among countries at different levels of economic
                        development. Last September before the U.N. General Assembly I endorsed that
                            concept.<note n="4" xml:id="d28fn4">See <ref target="#d17">Document
                                17</ref>.</note> At first, some were concerned because they saw the
                        charter as a set of unilateral demands; it has since become clear that it is
                        a farsighted concept of mutual obligations. In the emerging world of
                        interdependence, the weak as well as the strong have responsibilities, and
                        the world’s interest is each nation’s interest.</p>
                    <p>We can start by making the concept of the charter a reality in the Western
                        Hemisphere.</p>

                    <p>The United States will do its full part to see that our enterprise succeeds.
                        We can make a major contribution, but it would be in nobody’s <pb n="148"

                        expectations, leaving our peoples frustrated and our community empty. We

                        count.</p>
                    <p>I have carefully studied the agenda for this meeting you prepared in Bogotá.
                        I will respond in detail to its specifics in our private sessions. But I
                        will say here that I have come to a greater understanding of the deeply felt
                        motivations behind the phrases. You are concerned:</p>
                    <p>—That the United States has put aside its special commitment to the
                        hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>—That we will allow old issues to go unresolved while new ones are
                        created.</p>
                    <p>—That we seek not community but dominance.</p>
                    <p>—That our relationship does not adequately contribute to human welfare in the
                        hemisphere, that it is often irrelevant to your needs and an obstacle to
                        their fulfillment.</p>
                    <p>In response let me outline the direction the United States proposes to its
                        friends in rededicating itself to a new era of Western Hemisphere
                        relationships. I look forward to hearing your own views so that together we
                        can make the Western Hemisphere community a reality.</p>
                    <p>The United States will do its utmost to settle outstanding differences.
                        During the past year, the United States and Mexico solved the longstanding
                        Colorado River salinity dispute.<note n="5" xml:id="d28fn5">On August 30,
                            1973, the United States and Mexico signed an agreeement setting forth a

                            salinity of the Colorado River. (24 UST 1968; TIAS 7708) A White House
                            Fact Sheet listed the significant achievements of the agreement,
                            including: “It demonstrates the willingness of the United States to work
                            with Mexico in removing inequities in relations between the two
                            countries” and “It shows that through mutual effort and with good will

                    <p>The United States is prepared to work with the other nations of this
                        hemisphere on methods to eliminate new disputes or to mitigate their
                        effect.</p>
                    <p>Some of our most troublesome problems have arisen over differences concerning
                        the respective rights and obligations of private U.S. firms operating in
                        foreign countries and the countries which host them. These differences are
                        based largely on differing conceptions of state sovereignty and state
                        responsibility.</p>
                    <p>On the one hand, in keeping with the Calvo doctrine,<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d28fn8">Named after Argentine jurist and diplomat Carlos Calvo,
                            who elucidated these concepts in <hi rend="italic">International Law of
                                Europe and America in Theory and Practice</hi> (1868).</note> most
                        nations of this hemisphere affirm that a foreign investor has no right to
                        invoke the protection of his home government. On the other hand, the United
                        States has held that nations have the right to espouse the cause of their
                        investors if they believe they have been unfairly treated. This conviction
                        is reflected in the legislative provisions of the Gonzalez and Hickenlooper
                            amendments.<note n="9" xml:id="d28fn9">The Gonzalez amendment, approved
                            by Congress in March 1972, required the President to instruct his
                            representatives to international financial institutions, such as the IDA
                            and <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss>, to vote against any foreign
                            loans to countries that had expropriated U.S. investments without
                            compensation. The Hickenlooper amendment to the 1961 Foreign Assistance
                            Act terminated foreign assistance programs in nations that expropriated
                            U.S. property without compensation and also required the United States
                            to vote against loans made by international financial institutions to
                            countries engaged in expropriation activities.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Realistically, we must admit that these two elements cannot be easily or
                        quickly reconciled. But the United States is prepared to begin a process to
                        this end and to mitigate their effects. Even before a final resolution of
                        the philosophical and legal issues, we are ready to explore means by which
                        disputes can be removed from the forefront of our intergovernmental
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>In our private meetings I shall make specific proposals to establish agreed
                        machinery which might narrow the scope of disputes. For example, we might
                        consider the establishment of a working group to examine various procedures
                        for factfinding, conciliation, or the settlement of disputes. Other
                        approaches are possible, and I shall welcome the views of my colleagues. Let
                        me affirm here that a procedure acceptable to all the parties would remove
                        these disputes as factors in U.S. Government decisions respecting assistance
                        relationships with host countries. We would be prepared to discuss with our
                        Congress appropriate modifications of our legislation.</p>
                    <pb n="150" facs="0181" xml:id="pg_150"/>
                    <p>But we cannot achieve our goals simply by remedying specific grievances or
                        even by creating mechanisms that will eliminate the sources of disputes. A
                        special community can only emerge if we infuse it with life and
                        substance.</p>
                    <p>We must renew our political commitment to a Western Hemisphere system. Thomas
                        Macaulay once observed, “It is not the machinery we employ but the spirit we
                        are of that binds men together.” We are here because we recognize the need
                        for cooperation. Yet we can only cooperate if our people truly believe that
                        we are united by common purposes and a sense of common destiny.</p>
                    <p>The United States will be guided by these principles:</p>
                    <p>—We will not impose our political preferences.</p>
                    <p>—We will not intervene in the domestic affairs of others.</p>
                    <p>—We will seek a free association of proud peoples.</p>
                    <p>In this way, the Western Hemisphere community can make its voice and
                        interests felt in the world.</p>
                    <p>We realize that U.S. global interests sometimes lead to actions that have a
                        major effect on our sister republics. We understand, too, that there is no
                        wholly satisfactory solution to this problem.</p>
                    <p>However, to contribute to the sense of community we all seek, the United
                        States commits itself to close and constant consultation with its
                        hemispheric associates on political and economic issues of common interest,
                        particularly when these issues vitally affect the interests of our partners
                        in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>In my view, the best way to coordinate policies is to make a systematic
                        attempt to shape the future. I therefore recommend that today’s meeting be
                        considered the first of a series. The Foreign Ministers assembled here
                        should meet periodically for an informal review of the international
                        situation and of common hemispheric problems. In the interval between our
                        meetings, the heads of our planning staffs or senior officials with similar
                        responsibilities should meet on a regular basis to assess progress on a
                        common agenda. The principle of consultation on matters affecting each
                        other’s interests should be applied to the fullest extent possible.
                        Specifically:</p>
                    <p>—The United States is prepared to consult and adjust its positions on the
                        basis of reciprocity, in the multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
                    <p>—The United States also recognizes a fundamental congruity of interests among
                        the countries of the hemisphere in global monetary matters. We favor a
                        strong voice for Latin America in the management of a new monetary system,
                        just as we favor its effective participation in the reform of this
                        system.</p>
                    <p>—The United States is ready to undertake prior consultation in other
                        international negotiations such as the Law of the Sea Conference, the World
                        Food Conference, and the World Population Conference.</p>
                    <pb n="151" facs="0182" xml:id="pg_151"/>
                    <p>The Western Hemisphere community should promote a decent life for all its
                        citizens. No community is worthy of its name that does not actively foster
                        the dignity and prosperity of its peoples. The United States as the richest
                        and most powerful country in the hemisphere recognizes a special obligation
                        in this regard.</p>
                    <p>Let me sketch here the program which President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> has authorized and which I shall discuss in greater
                        detail with my colleagues this afternoon:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">First, in trade.</hi> During the period of great economic
                        uncertainty arising from the energy situation, it is essential that nations
                        behave cooperatively and not take protective or restrictive action. I pledge
                        to you today that the United States will do its utmost to avoid placing any
                        new limitations on access by Latin America to its domestic market.</p>
                    <p>In the same spirit we renew our commitment to the system of generalized
                        tariff preferences. We shall strongly support this legislation. Once it is
                        enacted, we will consult closely with you on how it can be most beneficial
                        to your needs.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Second, in science and technology.</hi> We want to improve
                        our private and governmental efforts to make available needed technology,
                        suited to varying stages of development in such vital areas as education,
                        housing, and agriculture. Private enterprise is the most effective carrier
                        of technology across national borders. But government, while not a
                        substitute, can usefully appraise the overall needs and spur progress. The
                        United States therefore recommends that we establish an inter-American
                        commission on technology. It should be composed of leading scientists and
                        experts from all the Americas and report to governments on the basis of
                        regular meetings.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Third, in energy.</hi> This hemisphere, linking
                        oil-producing and oil-consuming countries, is uniquely situated for
                        cooperative solutions of this problem. The United States is prepared to
                        share research for the development of energy sources. We will encourage the
                        Inter-American Development Bank to adapt its lending and fundraising
                        activities to cushion the current strains. We are also prepared to explore
                        ways of financing oil deficits, including the removal of remaining
                        institutional impediments to your access to U.S. capital markets.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Fourth, in development assistance.</hi> The U.S.
                        Government in its executive branch is committed to maintain our aid levels,
                        despite rising energy costs. On the other hand, the development problem can
                        no longer be resolved simply by accelerating official assistance. We need a
                        comprehensive review and recommendations on how all flows of capital and
                        technology—whether from concessional assistance, world capital markets, or
                        export credits—can contribute most effectively to hemispheric needs. I
                        recommend charging the inter-American body with these tasks.</p>

                    <p>Some form of institutional structure for peace and cooperation is clearly

                        prepared to cooperate in creative adjustments to meet new conditions.</p>
                    <p>A Spanish poet once wrote: “Traveler, there is no path; paths are made by
                        walking.” This is our most immediate need. We are not here to write a
                        communiqué, but to chart a course. Our success will be measured by whether
                        we in fact start a journey. I suggest we move ahead in three ways:</p>
                    <p>—First, let us make clear to our peoples that we do have a common destiny and
                        a modern framework for effective cooperation.</p>
                    <p>—Second, let us agree on an agenda for the Americas, a course of actions that
                        will give substance to our consensus and inspiration to our peoples.</p>
                    <p>—Third, let us define a program to bring that agenda to life.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, my distinguished colleagues, four centuries ago totally alien
                        cultures met for the first time near here. We are moving toward a world
                        whose demands upon us are nearly as alien to our experience as were the
                        Spaniards and the Aztecs to each other.</p>
                    <p>Today, if we are to meet the unprecedented challenge of an interdependent
                        world, we will also have to summon courage, faith, and dedication. The
                        United States believes we can build a world worthy of the best in us in
                        concert with our friends and neighbors. We want future generations to say
                        that in 1974, in Mexico, the nations of the Western Hemisphere took a new
                        road and proclaimed that in the Americas and the world they have a common
                            destiny.<note n="11" xml:id="d28fn11">The Declaration of Tlatelolco,

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We began détente in 1970
                        in an environment when we had to defend the budget for the Vietnam War and
                        fight constantly against the unilateral disarmers. Détente gave us: first,
                        domestic maneuvering room; secondly, an opportunity to get control of our
                        allies, and thirdly, to get into a position where we would not get the blame
                        for every confrontation that occurred.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">During a
                            March 8 meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>
                            and the Republican congressional leadership, <persName

                            détente. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said: “A
                            moderate Soviet policy is important—therefore the President’s
                            relationship with <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> is
                            important—and <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss>. We can’t put it to
                            them in every area and expect them to continue to take it.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> added: “Remember, if the Soviet
                            Union and China had wanted the Vietnam War to go on, it would have, and
                            the <gloss target="#t_POW_1">POW</gloss>’s would still be there. Our
                            interests are opposed to those of the Soviet Union in most areas of the
                            world—but we discuss with them our differences and we seek to avoid any
                            of these issues from provoking nuclear war.” The full memorandum of
                            conversation is printed in <ref target="frus1969-76v26#d31">

                        be seen that we would bend over backwards. So paradoxically, it has kept the
                        Defense budgets not high, but at an acceptable level; it has kept our allies
                        in line; and it let us end the Vietnam War in an acceptable way.
                        Détente—even with a President who is so hated—has resulted in the liberals
                        going to <pb n="154" facs="0185" xml:id="pg_154"/>the right of the
                        Administration. If détente were ended, they would immediately go left and
                        hit us for its failure.</p>
                    <p>We held off on trade until 1971, when they started to move on <gloss

                        and on Cienfuegos.</p>
                    <p>We had given the Soviet Union a list of areas where progress had to be made:
                        Middle East, Berlin, Vietnam, Cuba—we had good restraint. If I were in the
                        Politburo, I could make a case against <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> for détente—much more so than against us. Only the

                                Document 20</ref>.</note>—and that is just a bureaucratic snafu.</p>
                    <p>On <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, we were in a period of declining
                        defense budgets; we had no programs which we gave up. The defensive
                        agreement was a conspiracy of the bureaucracy. This is no intellectual
                        defense of the defensive agreement, except that we didn’t lose by it.</p>
                    <p>Where are we now? In the Middle East, the Soviet Union must be beside itself.
                        This is very worrisome. They could turn hard line.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: What would they do if
                        they went hardline?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They could make trouble
                        in the Middle East, in Europe, and especially domestically.</p>
                    <p>Clements: What the Soviet Union wants is the Suez Canal open. They can’t
                        screw up the Middle East until they get the Canal open.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I see no evidence of
                        that. The Soviet Union always talks in terms of an overall, not partial
                        settlement. They do that to force us either into affirming or changing the
                        ’67 boundaries—either way we would get one side down on us and get them back
                        in.</p>
                    <p>What this means is we can’t thwart the Soviet Union in every way at the same
                        time—on <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss>, in the Middle East, in <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. It is not just a position they can’t
                        accept, but one which will result in <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> being attacked for having been fooled.</p>
                    <p>We want the defense budget as high as the environment will allow; we want to
                        be tough when we need to do so; but keep the détente or peace symbol for
                        ourselves.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: How about Europe? Hints
                        that we may withdraw troops may be useful.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Atlantic area is the
                        key to our security. If we think that by competing in the Third World we can
                        do anything but bring about the destruction of the Western World, we are
                        wrong.</p>
                    <p>In Europe, we have weak governments that are appealing to all sides. They
                        kick the U.S., they spend a little more on defense for the right and to get
                        American protection free. Every decision the <gloss target="#t_EC_1"
                            >EC</gloss> has made has been anti-American.</p>

                    <p>Take Japan (and Canada). All the Europeans get is the Japanese maneuvering
                        between us and the Europeans and thus encouraging Japanese nationalism. The

                        their insecurity. They just maneuver. And this will come at the very time
                        when we will be in trouble in the Middle East on the issues of Palestine and
                        Jerusalem. We can’t tolerate a Europe united against us. The defense people
                        there are still good—and there are others.</p>
                    <p>The Europeans can’t be organically anti-American. If they are, why are
                        American troops in Europe? The defense of Europe is essential to the U.S.
                        How we defend it, however, is open. Our withdrawal could turn Europe
                        neutralist; if they are going that way anyway, we may have to threaten some
                        withdrawal. That would be a last resort. We have given up troop withdrawals.
                        We have to appeal to the good types in Europe.</p>
                    <p>French policy can be viciously shortsighted. In the 19th century, they
                        succeeded in unifying both Germany and Italy. Between the wars they
                        surrounded Germany with weak states. They weakened and humiliated Germany
                        but didn’t take steps to prevent them from doing anything about it. The
                        Maginot line was an invitation to Germany to turn east against the small
                        states.</p>

                        democracy after ’45 is a permanent phenomenon. They will be okay as long as
                        the balance of power stays—if it shifts, they could change overnight.</p>

                    <p>Question: What do we want the Europeans to be, allies or satellites?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: We began our effort with the Europeans early last year in the
                        conviction that our relationship was more like that of adversaries than of
                        friends. I felt we required a new vision. That was the essential intent of
                        my April 23rd speech.<note n="3" xml:id="d30fn3">
                            <ref target="#d8">Document 8</ref>.</note> However, the debate quickly
                        degenerated into something weird and almost unbelievable. I set out to
                        initiate a creative dialogue. If I had forseen the results, I would not have
                        begun the process.</p>
                    <p>People say I did not consult adequately before the speech. In January, 1973,
                        I discussed my ideas on two separate times with <persName corresp="#p_HE_1"
                            >Heath</persName>. I fully explained them then to <persName

                        discussed them with <persName corresp="#p_BW_1">Brandt</persName>. After the
                        speech I tried to proceed in a cooperative way—particularly with France. I

                        a bilateral. However, France shifted to a second phase in August and
                        insisted that all work should go through the European Community, that the
                        Community could not talk to the U.S. until after it had a firm united
                        position and then that its designated spokesman could communicate but not
                        negotiate any change in that position. It was like dealing with
                            Vichinsky.<note n="5" xml:id="d30fn5">Reference is to Andrey Vyshinsky,
                            who served as Soviet Foreign Minister, 1949–1953.</note> This turned the
                        whole effort into a theological argument. We do not want a Europe which is a
                        satellite, but we should be able to define our differences and discuss them
                        rationally with the Europeans.</p>
                    <p>As for the declaration, it was to have been the precursor of a substantive
                        dialogue, not a substitute for it. You ask should we continue with it. We
                        don’t know. The declarations are not important in themselves. If we choose
                        not to finish them or if we don’t finish them, then I would think that we
                        cannot really go to Europe. The issue is whether it makes better sense to
                        pretend there is understanding among us or to let the issue rest for awhile
                        and make another genuine effort later on. OFF THE RECORD: You asked why I
                        was not willing to advertise to you in advance that the April 23rd speech
                        was an important one. You should recall that I was the Special Assistant to
                        the President at the time I spoke and had a natural jurisdictional problem
                        with my predecessor,<note n="6" xml:id="d30fn6">Secretary of State <persName

                        statements at the time. END OFF THE RECORD.</p>
                    <p>You ask, since I have called the Europeans “corrupt and craven”, what is
                        their value? Why are we making such an effort over them? First, family
                        quarrels have a special intensity. In my writings you will find that I have
                        always expressed a special concern with the Europeans. Their behavior has
                        been tragic, legalistic and petty. I may have been extreme in my comment at
                        times but the consequences are of such importance. Consider, what can be the
                        future of Europe. It can become Finlandized, a backwater, or play a helpful
                        Western role.</p>
                    <p>Always we have to keep in mind the problem of future evolution in the Soviet
                        Union. We cannot dispute the possibility that some young Russians may reach
                        positions of power and say, “Let’s get this country <pb n="159" facs="0190"
                            xml:id="pg_159"/>moving again” and then it will be a much more dangerous
                        situation. The third world is anti-Western, if not anti-U.S. The U.S. cannot
                        do everything by itself on the globe. Thus it is extremely important that
                        other centers assume responsibility. I consider it highly important for
                        Europe to be more confident and more active. For me the whole point of the
                        Year of Europe was not to create the conditions for a satellite but to
                        encourage the evolution of allies who could play a role such as I have been
                        mentioning.</p>
                    <p>As for a prediction about what Europe might become, I think there is a better
                        than even chance Europe will become a historical backwater. Its present
                        course is suicidal. Take the case of oil and consider their own interests.
                        If we in the West engage in bilateral competition for resources, they will
                        lose, but in the end it will be bad for all of us. If they go to a meeting
                        with Arab Ministers, it is bound to turn out badly since the Europeans
                        simply will be forced to back the radical Arab elements. They are not strong
                        enough to do otherwise. The official European story as to how the European
                        Community was drawn into its special effort with the Arabs is hardly
                        believable. It goes back to the moment when the four Arab representatives
                        spontaneously, so some Europeans claim, turned up at Copenhagen.<note n="7"

                        Arab Emirates and Algeria. And they obviously did not really represent the
                        Arabs. The Europeans only told me about their proposed activity with the
                        Arabs two days before the Washington Energy Conference.<note n="8"

                        some general talk with <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Scheel</persName> but no
                        real forewarning of impending action. The next day I was in Brussels, a
                        peculiar situation where the European foreign ministers were present in town
                        but I was left to talk to the ambassadors in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>. I never attemped to see the ministers and <persName

                        fact.</p>
                    <p>I do think we have to keep our perspective. Neither we nor the Europeans
                        should have a veto on action by the other. But on matters af<pb n="160"
                            facs="0191" xml:id="pg_160"/>fecting vital policy of the other, each
                        should be ready to consult and try to coordinate. In practice the European
                        Community as it now works has not been willing to do this. The problem of
                        the mechanics or an arrangement for consultation is in part the guts of the
                        issue. We do not believe we would have had the differences we have had on
                        the Middle East or on energy if we had talked these issues out fully and
                        freely. But the real issue is that the Europeans it seems cannot define
                        their position except in opposition to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>OFF THE RECORD: On my relations with the President, I see him every day.
                        Obviously he has many preoccupations now and the intensity of our
                        discussions on foreign policy matters is less. After all, whatever your
                        judgement of events it has been a shattering experience for him. Is he short
                        tempered? Not with me. I have never had such treatment. I would say over the
                        last several months, from the time he came back from San Clemente until this
                        week, he has acquired a certain serenity, none of the nastiness such as your
                        paper has implied from time to time. Is he in charge of foreign policy? I’m
                        getting adequate guidance. There was a period when the public relations
                        people gave the impression he was making every tactical move. In fact he has
                        always concentrated on the big strategic issues and he makes the fundamental
                        decisions, the major ones. On tactical moves, I think I know his mind and
                        what he wants. This way of working is nothing new. It is simply a matter of
                        degree. END OFF THE RECORD.</p>
                    <p>As I have said before, you cannot continue to attack the central authority
                        without some consequence for our ability to carry out policy. I say this
                        analytically, you cannot do this without paying a price. With all modesty
                        one consequence these days has been an excessive attention to me. But
                        remember when a foreign leader makes agreements, he does so on the basis of
                        his expectation of performance in carrying out that agreement. And, of
                        course, when the central authority is attacked enough, that expectation is
                        reduced.</p>
                    <p>I have to supply continuity and a sense of steadiness and be true to my
                        responsibility to the President. On the way back from Panama<note n="10"
                            xml:id="d30fn10">See <ref target="#d28fn6">footnote 6, Document
                            28</ref>.</note> a group of Congressmen were holding forth that it would
                        be easier to impeach and that moreover, I would take care of foreign policy
                        so it really didn’t matter so much. I responded that it would be very
                        different to carry on foreign policy for an impeached president than for one
                        who was under attack. I have never said what I would do. But be clear on
                        this. I will not let my office be used as a basis for influencing
                        Congressional action on impeachment.</p>

                    <p>Question: What’s happening to détente and what are the Soviets up to?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: There has been much argument over who has gained what in the
                        process of détente. You should keep in mind that the Soviets could ask
                        themselves rather searching questions about whether they have gained enough
                        in the process. Grain, yes, they did gain. It was not discussed at the
                        Summit between the President and <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName>. But they did put one over on us because of a
                        bumbling bureaucracy. But except for the wheat deal what have they gotten
                        out of détente?</p>
                    <p>In this country some liberal groups seem unwilling to accept any monument to
                        an achievement by this administration.</p>
                    <p>I think we have to assess in which direction Soviet attitudes are moving. I
                        think I can detect a certain chill in Soviet attitudes. They are faced with
                        a lot of problems when they look at the course of affairs inside the U.S.
                        and even a compromise with <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName>
                        on <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss> may not save détente; without a
                        compromise it is hard to foresee what might happen to détente. As for the
                        form of a compromise, I can’t say now, that is really up to <persName
                            corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RAA_1"

                    <p>On <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, I agree with your editorial.<note

                        <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName>’s pressure was a major
                        factor in increased Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union, but beyond a

                        I don’t negotiate with <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName>. We

                        it.</p>
                    <p>I have no difference with <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                        >Schlesinger</persName>—although people try to impute problems to us. He has
                        a different constituency from mine. I have no evidence that he does not see
                        the basic problems of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> in the same way
                        I do. We have breakfast together every week, plus other frequent meetings
                        together with <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>. And there are verification panel
                        meetings which are used to bring out all technical viewpoints. I consider
                        him an ally.</p>
                    <p>As for a chill with the Soviets, I should emphasize that there are no Soviet
                        actions yet that you can really judge by, it is just a gut feeling, the way
                        communications are addressed, the number of them and this rather lengthy
                        absence of <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName>. What could
                        happen next? It could take some form of stiff opposition from the Soviets in
                        all international forums, but most immediately in the Middle East making it
                        difficult to proceed as we do, a push for reactivation of the Geneva
                        Conference, increased détente efforts with the Europeans and an effort to
                        create differences between us and the Europeans. I repeat, it has not showed
                        up <pb n="162" facs="0193" xml:id="pg_162"/>as yet. Maybe they’re only
                        waiting for me to get there. <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1"
                        >Gromyko</persName>’s pattern on the Middle East was frantic and a little
                        undignified: in each capital he arrived after me, after the decisions had
                        been made. The Soviet media commentary on the oil embargo which backed a
                        hard line, is it a sign? Maybe. Certainly progress in <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> would be a litmus test—absence of
                        progress on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> would not be. It depends
                        on how big a bite we want. But we can have a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> further agreement in time for the Presidential visit to
                        Moscow.</p>
                    <p>In <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> there would normally be three
                        phases. First, technical discussions, second a conceptual break-through, and
                        the time need not be too long between the second and third phase, final
                        negotiations. However, we have not yet made the conceptual
                        break-through.</p>
                    <p>You ask if the détente has not loosened the alliance. Well in <gloss
                            target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>, the Europeans have been almost as
                        obnoxious to the Soviets as any one else. The truth of the matter is that
                        détente with its illusion of peace, or perhaps the reality of peace, leaves
                        the nations free to be tougher with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The reaction to the alert during the Middle East war must raise questions in
                        the Soviet minds about how long the U.S. can sustain stiff positions. This
                        is a factor we have to bear in mind. On balance, I expect the Soviets to
                        continue to opt for détente.</p>
                    <p>You asked what are the benefits for the U.S. in détente? It has enabled us to
                        end the Viet-Nam war, temporarily to calm down the Middle East war, to
                        stabilize the situation in Europe, and to start on the path toward
                        controlling the arms race. The two super-powers have begun to regulate their
                        relationship and to make a beginning of working on problems without pushing
                        to extremes.</p>
                    <p>What about Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE_1">Bruce</persName>? He
                        asked some time ago if he could come back for consultation. While here I got
                        his judgment on Europe. His presence here had nothing to do with China. The
                        Chinese have been going to great efforts to signal to us that their own
                        policy initiative to the U.S. is unchanged. It is true that they don’t seem
                        at the moment to have the time to cultivate our relationship as they did
                        last year.</p>
                    <p>As for the Soviets and the Middle East, I don’t think the Soviets have made
                        up their minds what they want in the Middle East, or what they are prepared
                        to pay in that area. They are in the process of reassessing their policy.
                        They have three choices. One, they can force the issue and drive us to
                        another air lift for Israel, which would be difficult to sustain. Two, they
                        can wait for us to fall on our face. The further down the road we go, the
                        more difficult the tasks become. We have scrupulously avoided saying we
                        support the ’67 frontiers. Three, they could go ahead and accept peace in
                        the area, which is incidentally, quite unlikely. A settlement between Israel
                        and Syria will take a miracle. Israel now has placed settlements on the edge
                        of the Golan <pb n="163" facs="0194" xml:id="pg_163"/>Heights. Syria
                        operates on the theory that all of Israel historically belongs to Syria. The
                        chances are slightly better than 50–50 that I can succeed in obtaining a
                        disengagement there.</p>
                    <p>My timetable for the immediate future is, first, a visit to Moscow later this
                        month with a stop in London on the way back. I do not plan to add a visit to
                        the Middle East on the way back from Moscow. That would be too much of an
                        indignity for the Soviets. I expect to come back from Moscow, deal with a
                        Syrian emissary, and then hope for vacation.</p>

                        reveal that I took a very dim view of the theft of the Pentagon papers or of
                        unauthorized revelations concerning the China trip or the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations. But to go from there to a
                        connection with the burglaries of a psychiatrist’s office is a big step. I
                        think it would be a double-edged sword.</p>
                    <p>Will the President go to the Middle East in May? There is talk of it, but no
                        date. It depends on progress on Syrian disengagement. As for a trip to
                        Europe, we have not made a decision.</p>
                    <p>On Viet-Nam, it seems quite clear that there will be no offensive this dry
                        season. Plausibly, if South Viet-Nam doesn’t withstand an offensive now, it
                        will be their own fault. They have the wherewithal.</p>
                    <p>Back to the Soviet Union, I do not believe the Soviet Union exercised the
                        restraint it could have in the Middle East. On the other hand, if the
                        Soviets perceived that the Arabs would lose the war and didn’t want to
                        further diminish their influence, it could be understood why the Soviets
                        played out their hand as they did. The U.S.-Soviet relationship is delicate,
                        partly antagonistic, partly collaborative, and where the balance is, I
                        cannot judge. I do not think the Soviets provoked the Middle East war. Arab
                        leaders assured me of this. But the Soviets did provide the objective
                        conditions in which the war could happen. I would not be surprised as a
                        result of <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s visit to Egypt
                        to see more Soviet arms sent to Egypt. I make this comment based on no
                        intelligence sources whatsoever.</p>
                    <p>As for King Hussein, we’ll give him some more arms but we cannot compete on
                        the Soviet scale. He is paying the price of moderation. Given the Israeli
                        political situation, the Israelis have almost no <pb n="164" facs="0195"
                            xml:id="pg_164"/>choice, because their choice is to deal with the King
                        or <persName corresp="#p_AY_1">Arafat</persName>. They are doing neither at
                        the moment, which is really a choice for <persName corresp="#p_AY_1"
                            >Arafat</persName>. I assume someone will speak for <persName
                            corresp="#p_AY_1">Arafat</persName> when Geneva reopens. But Israel
                        needs the National Religious Party to govern—so this inhibits the Israelis
                        from making any decision on the West Bank.</p>
                    <p>Back to Europe, if the Europeans pursue their present course, we’ll
                        disassociate from them for their own good. It is a historic tragedy. For
                        years they complained that we ignored them. Now they complain about being
                        dragged into too close a relationship. The leadership there is obsessed with
                        internal matters and with lesser things. It was prepared to haggle
                        interminably over the word “partnership” and to be obsessed about procedure
                        so that at the Washington Energy Conference, for which we had prepared in
                        great detail, we never reached substance but were hung up on procedure among
                        the Europeans. We were not trying to tell Europe what was best for each of
                        them.</p>
                    <p>In France there is an inflamed domestic situation in which the French are
                        united only on being anti-American. The <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>
                        wishes not to break with either side. The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                        is internally preoccupied with its own politics. If the Europeans go ahead
                        and give technical assistance at a meeting with the Arabs, what will we do?
                        The U.S. has not fully decided; our next course is under study. OFF THE
                        RECORD: As for the declarations, we could stop any more work on them today
                        and have the President go to Europe and have a great success, because 98% of
                        what I asked for in my speech last year could be claimed as achieved. But it
                        would be politically and historically false. It would not mean that the
                        Atlantic nations were moving vigorously toward unity of action and
                        understanding. So I ask, is it worth going on to a big production under that
                        circumstance or is the issue something we have to decide. If we shelve the
                        declaration, people will say it was a great failure. If we go on with them,
                        we contribute to an illusion. There is a 50–50 chance they will be completed
                        but the way in which this is done and the timing will be our decision. The
                        real question is will it be a meaningful activity. END OFF THE RECORD.</p>
                    <p>As for the Argentine and Canadian application to ship to Cuba, the Canadian
                        request is different because it is a Canadian company with some U.S.
                        directors and using some U.S. parts. The Argentine case involved a U.S.
                        subsidiary. I have made two separate recommendations, not necessarily
                        different, to the President and it is in his hands. It is very possible the

                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration’s trade
                        bill, sent to Congress in April 1973 (see <ref target="#d5fn1">footnote 1,
                            Document 5</ref> and <ref target="#d19fn3">footnote 3, Document
                        19</ref>), continued to generate congressional debate during early 1974. The
                        opponents of the administration’s proposal, led by Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_JHM_1">Henry “Scoop” Jackson</persName> (D–Washington) and
                        Representative <persName corresp="#p_VC_2">Charles Vanik</persName>
                        (D–Ohio), asserted that the United States should not extend
                        most-favored-nation status (<gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss>) to the
                        Soviet Union, due to restrictive emigration policies applied to Soviet Jews.
                        As <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> commented in late
                        December 1973: “We are asked to believe that the prospects for peace are
                        enhanced by the flow of Pepsi-Cola to the Soviet Union and the flow of vodka
                        to the United States.” He continued: “We will move much further along the
                        road to a stable peace when we see the free flow of people and ideas across
                        the barriers that divide East and West—a flow unchecked by arbitrary and
                        capricious power.” (“Debate Looms in Congress on Soviet Trade,” <hi
                            rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, January 1, 1974, page A4) President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard Nixon</persName> and Secretary of
                        State <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName> placed the
                        trade bill within the larger context of détente, asserting that a relaxation
                        in trade policy stood to benefit the United States, the Soviet Union, major
                        trading nations, and the developing world. During his testimony to the
                        Senate Committee on Finance on March 7, 1974, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> responded to criticisms that the pursuit of
                        détente with the Soviet Union condoned Soviet internal policies:</p>
                    <p>“The most painful aspect of this debate—for me personally and for many others
                        in the administration—centers around the question of respect for human
                        rights in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>“This is not a dispute between the morally sensitive and the morally obtuse.
                        It is, rather, a problem of choosing between alternatives.</p>
                    <p>“I do not oppose the objective of those who wish to use trade policy to
                        affect the evolution of Soviet society; it does seem to me, however, that
                        they have chosen the wrong vehicle and the wrong context. We cannot accept
                        the principle that our entire foreign policy—or even an essential component
                        of that policy such as a normalization of our trade relations—should be made
                        dependent on the transformation of the Soviet domestic structure.</p>
                    <p>“I say this with some anguish, since both as a historian and as one whose own
                        origins make him particularly conscious of the plight of minority groups, I
                        would prefer that we could do otherwise.</p>
                    <p>“Let us remember that we seek détente with the Soviet Union for one
                        overwhelming reason: Both countries have the capability to destroy each
                        other—and most of the rest of the world in the process. Thus, both of us
                        have an overriding obligation to do all in our power to prevent such a
                        catastrophe.</p>
                    <pb n="166" facs="0197" xml:id="pg_166"/>
                    <p>“Détente is not rooted in agreement on values; it becomes above all necessary
                        because each side recognizes that the other is a potential adversary in a
                        nuclear war. To us, détente is a process of managing relations with a
                        potentially hostile country in order to preserve peace while maintaining our
                        vital interests. In a nuclear age, this is in itself an objective not
                        without moral validity—it may indeed be the most profound imperative of
                        all.</p>
                    <p>“Détente is founded on a frank recognition of basic differences and dangers.
                        Precisely because we are conscious that these differences exist, we have
                        sought to channel our relations with the U.S.S.R. into a more stable
                        framework—a structure of interrelated and interdependent agreements. Forward
                        movement in our relations must be on a broad front, encompassing a wide
                        range of mutually reinforcing activities, so that groups and individuals in
                        both countries will have a vested interest in the maintenance of peace and
                        the growth of a stable international order.</p>
                    <p>“Since détente is rooted in a recognition of differences and based on the
                        prevention of disaster, there are sharp limits to what we can insist upon as
                        part of this relationship. We have a right to demand responsible
                        international behavior from the U.S.S.R.; we did not hesitate to make this
                        clear during the Middle East crisis. We also have a right to demand that
                        agreements we sign are observed in good faith.</p>
                    <p>“But with respect to basic changes in the Soviet system, the issue is not
                        whether we condone what the U.S.S.R. does internally; it is whether and to
                        what extent we can risk other objectives—and especially the building of a
                        structure for peace—for these domestic changes. I believe that we cannot and
                        that to do so would obscure, and in the long run defeat, what must remain
                        our overriding objective: the prevention of nuclear war.” (Department of
                        State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, April 1, 1974, page 323)</p>
                    <p>A week after <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> testified to

                        on March 15. The President, commenting that the club’s members had
                        previously indicated their preference for a question-and-answer session over
                        a lengthy speech, eschewed prepared remarks. In response to concerns that
                        the administration’s pursuit of détente jeopardized American domestic and
                        foreign positions, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                        responded:</p>
                    <p>“With regard to the policy of détente, let us first understand that whether
                        it is with the Soviet Union or the People’s Republic of China, neither
                        side—and I have met the top leaders of both—has any illusions about our vast
                        differences as far as philosophy is concerned.</p>
                    <p>“Second, the fact that we have negotiation rather than confrontation does not
                        in any way imply that we approve of their internal policies or for that
                        matter that they approve of ours.</p>

                    <p>“Third, when we say that the policy of détente has been two for them, in
                        effect, and one for us—I think that is shorthanding what you said, but I
                        think properly so—I think that what we must understand, first, is what the
                        policy of détente has accomplished.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> proceeded to mention the
                        administration’s success in ending the Vietnam war, avoiding a military
                        confrontation with the Soviet Union during the October 1973 Middle East war,
                        and pursuing agreements to limit strategic arms. The President then returned
                        to the issue of détente’s critics:</p>
                    <p>“And finally, the alternative to détente. There are those who say because of
                        the way the Russians treat their minorities, we should break off our
                        relations with them, we should not trade with them, we should deny them
                        credits, and then maybe they will change. Well, first, they aren’t going to
                        change if we do that. It will have exactly the opposite effect.</p>
                    <p>“But the second point is, if we go back to the old policy of confrontation,
                        not negotiating to limit nuclear arms and other arms possibly in the future,
                        not negotiate with the hope of resolving differences at the conference table
                        rather than on the battlefield, then what you have to do is to face the
                        necessity for the United States to enter an arms race, and instead of an $8
                        billion increase in the arms budget, you would have $100 billion increase in
                        the arms budget. And eventually you would confront what would be a massive
                        crisis between the Soviet Union and the United States in the Mideast, in
                        Europe, possibly even in the Mediterranean, as well as in the Caribbean
                        area, where our interests are in conflict.</p>
                    <p>“I would simply conclude my answer with this: Nobody, I know, will question
                        my credentials with regard to the Soviet system and my disagreements with
                        it. I would also say, however, that I have learned that it is much better to
                        have your voice heard within the Kremlin than outside.</p>
                    <p>“One of the problems that has concerned me, sir, has been the fact that many
                        complaints very properly have been made with regard to the treatment of
                        minorities in the Soviet Union and particularly those of the Jewish
                        faith.</p>
                    <p>“Let me tell you the figures. Before we started talking to the Soviets in our
                        period of negotiation, 400 Soviet Jews a year got out. In the first year of
                        our talks, 17,000 got out. Last year 35,000 got out.</p>
                    <p>“Now, they still aren’t doing what we would do or what we would want them to
                        do, but it is far better to have the voice of the President of the United
                        States heard from within the Kremlin than the outside, because those walls
                        are mighty thick, I can tell you.</p>
                    <p>“So, therefore, let us continue to talk to them, so we won’t have to fight
                        them.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"

                    <p rend="center">The Challenge of Interdependence</p>
                    <p>We are gathered here in a continuing venture to realize mankind’s hopes for a
                        more prosperous, humane, just, and cooperative world.</p>
                    <p>As members of this organization, we are pledged not only to free the world
                        from the scourge of war but to free mankind from the fear of hunger,
                        poverty, and disease. The quest for justice and dignity—which finds
                        expression in the economic and social articles of the United Nations
                        Charter—has global meaning in an age of instantaneous commu<pb n="169"
                            facs="0200" xml:id="pg_169"/>nication. Improving the quality of human
                        life has become a universal political demand, a technical possibility, and a
                        moral imperative.</p>
                    <p>We meet here at a moment when the world economy is under severe stress. The
                        energy crisis first dramatized its fragility. But the issues transcend that
                        particular crisis. Each of the problems we face—of combating inflation and
                        stimulating growth, of feeding the hungry and lifting the impoverished, of
                        the scarcity of physical resources and the surplus of despair—is part of an
                        interrelated global problem.</p>
                    <p>Let us begin by discarding outdated generalities and sterile slogans we
                        have—all of us—lived with for so long. The great issues of development can
                        no longer realistically be perceived in terms of confrontation between the
                        “haves” and “have-nots” or as a struggle over the distribution of static[<hi
                            rend="italic">statist</hi>?] wealth. Whatever our ideological belief or
                        social structure, we are part of a single international economic system on
                        which all of our national economic objectives depend. No nation or bloc of
                        nations can unilaterally determine the shape of the future.</p>
                    <p>If the strong attempt to impose their views, they will do so at the cost of
                        justice and thus provoke upheaval. If the weak resort to pressure, they will
                        do so at the risk of world prosperity and thus provoke despair.</p>
                    <p>The organization of one group of countries as a bloc will, sooner or later,
                        produce the organization of potential victims into a counterbloc. The
                        transfer of resources from the developed to the developing nations—essential
                        to all hopes for progress—can only take place with the support of the
                        technologically advanced countries. Politics of pressure and threats will
                        undermine the domestic base of this support. The danger of economic
                        stagnation stimulates new barriers to trade and to the transfer of
                        resources.</p>
                    <p>We in this Assembly must come to grips with the fact of our
                        interdependence.</p>
                    <p>The contemporary world can no longer be encompassed in traditional
                        stereotypes. The notion of the northern rich and the southern poor has been
                        shattered. The world is composed not of two sets of interests but many:
                        developed nations which are energy suppliers and developing nations which
                        are energy consumers, market economies and nonmarket economies, capital
                        providers and capital recipients.</p>
                    <p>The world economy is a sensitive set of relationships in which actions can
                        easily set off a vicious spiral of counteractions deeply affecting all
                        countries, developing as well as technologically advanced. Global inflation
                        erodes the capacity to import. A reduction in the rate of world growth
                        reduces export prospects. Exorbitantly high prices lower consumption, spur
                        alternative production, and foster development of substitutes.</p>
                    <pb n="170" facs="0201" xml:id="pg_170"/>
                    <p>We are all engaged in a common enterprise. No nation or group of nations can
                        gain by pushing its claims beyond the limits that sustain world economic
                        growth. No one benefits from basing progress on tests of strength.</p>
                    <p>For the first time in history, mankind has the technical possibility to
                        escape the scourges that used to be considered inevitable. Global
                        communication insures that the thrust of human aspirations becomes
                        universal. Mankind insistently identifies justice with the betterment of the
                        human condition. Thus economics, technology, and the sweep of human values
                        impose a recognition of our interdependence and of the necessity of our
                        collaboration.</p>
                    <p>Let us therefore resolve to act with both realism and compassion to reach a
                        new understanding of the human condition. On that understanding, let us base
                        a new relationship which evokes the commitment of all nations because it
                        serves the interests of all peoples. We can build a just world only if we
                        work together.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Global Agenda</p>
                    <p>The fundamental challenge before this session is to translate the
                        acknowledgment of our common destiny into a commitment to common action, to
                        inspire developed and developing nations alike to perceive and pursue their
                        national interest by contributing to the global interest. The developing
                        nations can meet the aspirations of their peoples only in an open, expanding
                        world economy where they can expect to find larger markets, capital
                        resources, and support for official assistance. The developed nations can
                        convince their people to contribute to that goal only in an environment of
                        political cooperation.</p>
                    <p>On behalf of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>, I
                        pledge the United States to a major effort in support of development. My
                        country dedicates itself to this enterprise because our children—yours and
                        ours—must not live in a world of brutal inequality, because peace cannot be
                        maintained unless all share in its benefits, and because America has never
                        believed that the values of justice, well-being, and human dignity could be
                        realized by one nation alone.</p>
                    <p>We begin with the imperative of peace. The hopes of development will be
                        mocked if resources continue to be consumed by an ever-increasing spiral of
                        armaments. The relaxation of tensions is thus in the world interest. No
                        nation can profit from confrontations that could culminate in nuclear war.
                        At the same time, the United States will never seek stability at the expense
                        of others. It strives for the peace of cooperation, not the illusory
                        tranquility of condominium.</p>
                    <p>But peace is more than the absence of war. It is ennobled by making possible
                        the realization of humane aspirations. To this purpose this Assembly is
                        dedicated.</p>
                    <pb n="171" facs="0202" xml:id="pg_171"/>
                    <p>Our goal cannot be reached by resolutions alone. It must remain the subject
                        of constant, unremitting efforts over the years and decades ahead.</p>
                    <p>In this spirit of describing the world as it is, I would like to identify for
                        this Assembly six problem areas which, in the view of the U.S. delegation,
                        must be solved to spur both the world economy and world development. I do so
                        not with the attitude of presenting blueprints but of defining common tasks
                        to whose solution the United States herewith offers its wholehearted
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Expanding the Supply of Energy</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> a global economy requires an expanding supply
                        of energy at an equitable price.</p>
                    <p>No subject illustrates global interdependence more emphatically than the
                        field of energy. No nation has an interest in prices that can set off an
                        inflationary spiral which in time reduces income for all. For example, the
                        price of fertilizer has risen in direct proportion to the price of oil,
                        putting it beyond the reach of many of the poorest nations and thus
                        contributing to worldwide food shortages. A comprehension by both producers
                        and consumers of each other’s needs is therefore essential:</p>
                    <p>—Consumers must understand the desires of the producers for higher levels of
                        income over the long-term future.</p>
                    <p>—Producers must understand that the recent rise in energy prices has placed a
                        great burden on all consumers, one virtually impossible for some to
                        bear.</p>
                    <p>All nations share an interest in agreeing on a level of prices which
                        contributes to an expanding world economy and which can be sustained over
                        the long term.</p>
                    <p>The United States called the Washington Energy Conference<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d32fn2">See <ref target="#d27">Document 27</ref>.</note> for one
                        central purpose—to move urgently to resolve the energy problem on the basis
                        of cooperation among all nations. The tasks we defined there can become a
                        global agenda:</p>
                    <p>—Nations, particularly developed nations, waste vast amounts of existing
                        energy supplies. We need a new commitment to global conservation and to more
                        efficient use of existing supplies.</p>
                    <p>—The oil producers themselves have noted that the demands of this decade
                        cannot be met unless we expand available supplies. We need a massive and
                        cooperative effort to develop alternative sources of fuels.</p>
                    <p>—The needs of future generations require that we develop new and renewable
                        sources of supply. In this field, the developed nations <pb n="172"
                            facs="0203" xml:id="pg_172"/>can make a particularly valuable
                        contribution to our common goal of abundant energy at reasonable cost.</p>
                    <p>Such a program cannot be achieved by any one group of countries. It must draw
                        on the strength and meet the needs of all nations in a new dialogue among
                        producers and consumers.</p>
                    <p>In such a dialogue, the United States will take account of—and take
                        seriously—the concern of the producing countries that the future of their
                        peoples not depend on oil alone. The United States is willing to help
                        broaden the base of their economies and to develop secure and diversified
                        sources of income. We are prepared to facilitate the transfer of technology
                        and to assist industrialization. We will accept substantial investment of
                        the capital of oil-producing countries in the United States. We will support
                        a greater role for oil producers in international financial organizations as
                        well as an increase in their voting power.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Avoiding Imbalances in Raw Materials</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> a healthy global economy requires that both
                        consumers and producers escape from the cycle of raw material surplus and
                        shortage which threatens all our economies.</p>
                    <p>The principles which apply to energy apply as well to the general problem of
                        raw materials. It is tempting to think of cartels of raw material producers
                        to negotiate for higher prices. But such a course could have serious
                        consequences for all countries. Large price increases coupled with
                        production restrictions involve potential disaster: global inflation
                        followed by global recession from which no nation could escape.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, resources are spread unevenly across the globe. Some of the poorest
                        nations have few natural resources to export, and some of the richest
                        nations are major commodity producers.</p>
                    <p>Commodity producers will discover that they are by no means insulated from
                        the consequences of restrictions on supply or the escalation of prices. A
                        recession in the industrial countries sharply reduces demand. Uneconomical
                        prices for raw materials accelerate the transition to alternatives. And as
                        they pursue industrialization, raw material producers will ultimately pay
                        for exorbitant commodity prices by the increased costs of the goods they
                        must import.</p>
                    <p>Thus the optimum price is one that can be maintained over the longest period
                        at the level that assures the highest real income. Only through cooperation
                        between consumers and producers can such a price be determined. Such a
                        cooperative effort must include urgent international consideration of
                        restrictions on incentives for the trade in commodities. This issue—dealing
                        with access to supply as well as access to markets—must receive high
                        priority in <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> [General <pb n="173"

                        revise and modernize the rules and conditions of international trade.</p>
                    <p>In the long term, our hopes for world prosperity will depend on our ability
                        to discern the long-range patterns of supply and demand and to forecast
                        future imbalances so as to avert dangerous cycles of surplus and
                        shortage.</p>
                    <p>For the first time in history, it is technically within our grasp to relate
                        the resources of this planet to man’s needs. The United States therefore
                        urges that an international group of experts, working closely with the
                        United Nations Division on Resources, be asked to undertake immediately a
                        comprehensive survey of the earth’s nonrenewable and renewable resources.
                        This should include the development of a global early warning system to
                        foreshadow impending surpluses and scarcities.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Crisis in Food Production</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, the global economy must achieve a balance
                        between food production and population growth and must restore the capacity
                        to meet food emergencies. A condition in which 1 billion people suffer from
                        malnutrition is consistent with no concept of justice.</p>
                    <p>Since 1969, global production of cereals has not kept pace with world demand.
                        As a result, current reserves are at their lowest level in 20 years. A
                        significant crop failure today is likely to produce a major disaster. A
                        protracted imbalance in food and population growth will guarantee massive
                        starvation—a moral catastrophe the world community cannot tolerate.</p>
                    <p>No nation can deal with this problem alone. The developed nations must commit
                        themselves to significant assistance for food and population programs. The
                        developed nations must reduce the imbalance between population and food
                        which could jeopardize not only their own progress but the stability of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>The United States recognizes the responsibility of leadership it bears by
                        virtue of its extraordinary agricultural productivity. We strongly support a
                        global cooperative effort to increase food production. This is why we
                        proposed a World Food Conference at last year’s session of the General
                            Assembly.<note n="4" xml:id="d32fn4">See <ref target="#d17">Document

                    </p>
                    <p>Looking toward that conference, we have removed all domestic restrictions on
                        production. Our farmers have vastly increased the acreage under cultivation
                        and gathered record harvests in 1973. 1974 promises to be even better. If
                        all nations make a similar effort, we believe the recent rise in food prices
                        will abate this year, as it has in recent weeks.</p>
                    <pb n="174" facs="0205" xml:id="pg_174"/>
                    <p>The United States is determined to take additional steps. Specifically:</p>
                    <p>—We are prepared to join with other governments in a major worldwide effort
                        to rebuild food reserves. A central objective of the World Food Conference
                        must be to restore the world’s capacity to deal with famine.</p>
                    <p>—We shall assign priority in our aid program to help developing nations
                        substantially raise their agricultural production. We hope to increase our
                        assistance to such programs from $258 million to $675 million this year.</p>
                    <p>—We shall make a major effort to increase the quantity of food aid over the
                        level we provided last year.</p>
                    <p>For countries living near the margin of starvation, even a small reduction in
                        yields can produce intolerable consequences. Thus, the shortage of
                        fertilizer and the steep rise in its price is a problem of particular
                        urgency—above all for countries dependent on the new high-yield varieties of
                        grain. The first critical step is for all nations to utilize fully existing
                        capabilities. The United States is now operating its fertilizer industry at
                        near capacity. The United States is ready to provide assistance to other
                        nations in improving the operation of plants and to make more effective use
                        of fertilizers.</p>
                    <p>But this will not be enough. Existing worldwide capacity is clearly
                        inadequate. The United States would be prepared to offer its technological
                        skills to developing a new fertilizer industry in developing countries and
                        especially in oil-producing countries, using the raw materials and capital
                        they uniquely possess.</p>
                    <p>We also urge the establishment of an international fertilizer institute as
                        part of a larger effort to focus international action on two specific areas
                        of research: improving the effectiveness of chemical fertilizers, especially
                        in tropical agriculture, and new methods to produce fertilizers from
                        non-petroleum resources. The United States will contribute facilities,
                        technology, and expertise to such an undertaking.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nations at the Margin of Existence</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Fourth,</hi> a global economy under stress cannot allow
                        the poorest nations to be overwhelmed.</p>
                    <p>The debate between raw material producers and consumers must not overlook
                        that substantial part of humanity which does not produce raw materials,
                        grows insufficient food for its needs, and has not adequately
                        industrialized. This group of nations, already at the margin of existence,
                        has no recourse to pay the higher prices for the fuel, food, and fertilizer
                        imports on which their survival depends.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the people least able to afford it—a third of mankind—are the most
                        profoundly threatened by an inflationary world economy. <pb n="175"
                            facs="0206" xml:id="pg_175"/>They face the despair of abandoned hopes
                        for development and the threat of starvation. Their needs require our most
                        urgent attention. The nations assembled here in the name of justice cannot
                        stand idly by in the face of tragic consequences for which many of them are
                        partially responsible.</p>
                    <p>We welcome the steps the oil producers have already taken toward applying
                        their new surplus revenues to these needs. The magnitude of the problem
                        requires, and the magnitude of their resources permits, a truly massive
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>The developed nations, too, have an obligation to help. Despite the prospect
                        of unprecedented payment difficulties, they must maintain their traditional
                        programs of assistance and expand them if possible. Failure to do so would
                        penalize the lower income countries twice. The United States is committed to
                        continue its program and pledges its support for an early replenishment of
                        the International Development Association. In addition, we are prepared to
                        consider with others what additional measures are required to mitigate the
                        effects of commodity price rises on low-income countries least able to bear
                        the burden.</p>

                        consumes resources at an ever-expanding rate, a population explosion which
                        presses against the earth’s finite living space, and an agriculture
                        increasingly dependent on the products of industry. Let us now apply science
                        to the problems which science has helped to create:</p>
                    <p>—To meet the developing nations’ two most fundamental problems, unemployment
                        and hunger, there is an urgent need for farming technologies that are both
                        productive and labor intensive. The United States is prepared to contribute
                        to international programs to develop and apply this technology.</p>
                    <p>—The technology of birth control should be improved.</p>
                    <p>—At current rates of growth, the world’s need for energy will more than
                        triple by the end of this century. To meet this challenge, the <pb n="176"
                            facs="0207" xml:id="pg_176"/>U.S. Government is allocating $12 billion
                        for energy research and development over the next five years, and American
                        private industry will spend over $200 billion to increase energy supplies.
                        We are prepared to apply the results of our massive effort to the massive
                        needs of other nations.</p>
                    <p>—The poorest nations, already beset by manmade disasters, have been
                        threatened by a natural one: the possibility of climatic changes in the
                        monsoon belt and perhaps throughout the world. The implications for global
                        food and population policies are ominous. The United States proposes that
                        the International Council of Scientific Unions and the World Meteorological
                        Organization urgently investigate this problem and offer guidelines for
                        immediate international action.</p>

                        themselves to avoid trade and payment restrictions in an effort to adjust to
                        higher commodity prices.</p>
                    <p>The United States is prepared to keep open its capital markets so that
                        capital can be recycled to developing countries hardest hit by the current
                        crisis.</p>
                    <p>In the essential struggle to regain control over global inflation, the United
                        States is willing to join in an international commitment to pursue
                        responsible fiscal and monetary policies.</p>
                    <p>To foster an open trading world the United States, already the largest
                        importer of the manufactures of developing nations, is prepared to open its
                        markets further to these products. We shall work in the multilateral trade
                        negotiations to reduce tariff and nontariff barriers on as wide a front as
                        possible. In line with this approach we are urging our Congress to authorize
                        the generalized tariff preferences which are of such significance to
                        developing countries.</p>

                    <p>All too often, international gatherings end with speeches filed away and with
                        resolutions passed and forgotten. We must not let this happen to the problem
                        of development. The complex and urgent issues at hand will not yield to
                        rhetorical flourishes. Their resolution requires a sustained and determined
                        pursuit in the great family of United Nations and other international

                        commits itself to a wide-ranging multilateral effort.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, we gather here today because our
                        economic and moral challenges have become political challenges. Our
                        unprecedented agenda for global consultations in 1974 already implies a
                        collective decision to elevate our concern for man’s elementary well-being
                        to the highest political level. Our presence implies our recognition that a
                        challenge of this magnitude cannot be solved by a world fragmented into
                        self-contained states or competing blocs.</p>
                    <p>Our task now is to match our physical needs with our political vision.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Boumediene</persName> cited the
                        Marshall plan of a quarter century ago as an example of the possibility of
                        mobilizing resources for development ends. But then the driving force was a
                        shared sense of purpose, of values, and of destination. As yet, we lack a
                        comparable sense of purpose with respect to development. This is our first
                        requirement. Development requires, above all, a spirit of cooperation, a
                        belief that with all our differences we are part of a larger community in
                        which wealth is an obligation, resources are a trust, and joint action is a
                        necessity.</p>
                    <p>We need mutual respect for the aspirations of the developing as well as the
                        concerns of the developed nations. This is why the United <pb n="178"
                            facs="0209" xml:id="pg_178"/>States has supported the concept of a

                            corresp="#p_EL_1">Echeverría</persName> of Mexico.</p>
                    <p>The late President Radhakrishnan of India once wrote:</p>
                    <p>We are not the helpless tools of determinism. Though humanity renews itself
                        from its past, it is also developing something new and unforeseen. Today we
                        have to make a new start with our minds and hearts.</p>
                    <p>The effort we make in the years to come is thus a test of the freedom of the
                        human spirit.</p>
                    <p>Let us affirm today that we are faced with a common challenge and can only
                        meet it jointly. Let us candidly acknowledge our different perspectives and
                        then proceed to build on what unites us. Let us transform the concept of
                        world community from a slogan into an attitude.</p>
                    <p>In this spirit let us be the masters of our common fate so that history will
                        record that this was the year that mankind at last began to conquer its
                        noblest and most humane challenge.</p>

                        interests of the nation require it, despite the views of most of their
                        constituents. We need to go over it all, but there are two areas where
                        peacekeeping is especially important—one is Vietnam. I will only say we
                        believe it is a good investment in keeping the peace in the area. It’s
                        better to take this step rather than one which will drift into another
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>The other area is the Middle East. The controversial area is Israel. Also
                        Egypt and an increase to Jordan. I support both. Aid for Israel is important
                        if it is to survive, and we had to support it against the Soviet-supported
                        attack. For Egypt, some Israeli supporters oppose it, saying we should
                        support only Israel. But it is far better that we support Egypt than that
                        others do. I know no constituency in the U.S. for Israel’s neighbors, and
                        there’s a big one for Israel because of Jewish contributors to this country.
                        But this aid is of great importance to Israel. </p>

                    <p>The idea that Israel can defend itself with only American arms was proved
                        false in October.<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">During the October 1973

                    <p>We are at a watershed period in foreign policy, in a period when often we are
                        tied exclusively to Israel. We are now developing a relationship of
                        friendship with the whole area. It’s not to get the Soviet Union out—that is
                        self-defeating—but to have us in. Not with a big giveaway, but to play a
                        peacekeeping role. Others may have designs on the Middle East. The Arabs who
                        are turning to us know they have nothing to fear from us. This is a great
                        price for their independence and peace in the area.</p>
                    <p>It’s the same for Southeast Asia—whether we will have the strength and vision
                        to play the role that only we can play in bringing an at best uneasy peace
                        in the area.</p>

                        situation and examine your recommendations. I will do everything I can in a

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The program has
                        development assistance, a significant program for the Middle East, and
                            Indochina.<note n="4" xml:id="d33fn4">During his April 26 news

                            foreign assistance program “has been deliberately shaped to take account
                            of the priority areas that we have put before the special session of the
                            General Assembly and before the Organization of American States, and we
                            hope that during the year we can further refine these programs.”

                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s address at the
                            Conference of Tlatelolco in Mexico City.</note> I would say this program
                        has great political significance. It’s not just do good. It comes at time of
                        attempts at producer control and consumer-producer confrontation. We can
                        stand this better than most, but it is dangerous for the world. We want to
                        defuse the confrontation. We have drawn even the Algerians into cooperation
                        with us.</p>
                    <p>Our basic point is not that of the 50’s and 60’s, that raising living
                        standards in undeveloped countries would bring stability, but in order to
                        build cooperation which would prevent bloc confrontation.</p>
                    <p>So when you study our proposals, you should know that our basic philosophy is
                        to induce cooperation, and to prevent confrontation or pressure on our
                        allies.</p>

                    <p>First, Middle East progress. We are introducing one of significant diplomatic
                        revolutions of the postwar world. Before we did it we assumed that most
                        Middle East countries were Soviet satellites. We assumed that we spoke for
                        Israel and the Soviet Union spoke for the Arabs whenever we had a summit. It
                        was the President’s firmness at the summit which showed the Arabs that the
                        Soviet Union couldn’t deliver anything but arms.<note n="6" xml:id="d33fn6"
                            >Presumably a reference to the summit meetings in Washington and San
                            Clemente in June and July 1973.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The structure needed in the Middle East is an Israel strong enough that it
                        can’t be defeated by the Arabs and an American diplomacy not so one-sided
                        that the Arabs won’t talk to us. That is why both are important in the
                        progress we have achieved.</p>
                    <p>The President: Our Israeli aid is ten times that of the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’re asking
                        $250 million for Egypt plus $100 million for a contingency fund.</p>
                    <p>You who have been in the Middle East know that Egypt has made an enormous
                        turn in its foreign policy—from war to peace. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                            >Sadat</persName> is the first leader to commit his country to peace on
                        terms other than the extermination of Israel. The disengagement couldn’t
                        have happened without <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s wisdom
                        and his willingness to look to the long range. He has also broken the Soviet
                        link, which made Egypt the focal point for Soviet aid and Soviet propaganda.
                        Cairo Radio used to be the spearhead. Egypt is now making a positive effort
                        to introduce the U.S. in the Middle East. A lifting of the embargo is not
                        possible without Egypt’s help. Egypt needs help partly because of the need
                        for reconstruction and partly because <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                            >Sadat</persName> has to demonstrate to his people that the new policy
                        has benefits and that he has ties to the United States.</p>
                    <p>The items in line for Egypt are extremely modest, and we can’t exclude that
                        we might need more. But this is our best judgment now.</p>
                    <p>Other items are for Jordan. As long as Jordan represents the Palestinians and
                        leads the negotiation on that front, there is hope for stability and
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>We also support the traditional amounts for Israel. We can make progress with
                        Israel only to the extent they don’t feel their security is jeopardized. The
                        usual amounts are in, plus a breakout of the $2.2 billion.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_BEW3_1">Brooke</persName>: If Israel would send
                        signals that it would accept this approach, it would help this proposal.</p>
                    <pb n="182" facs="0213" xml:id="pg_182"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I saw Dinitz
                        last night. I told him if the Soviet Union cut off Egypt, we couldn’t let
                        Egypt down. He said “I understand what you are doing.” I will ask him today
                        about sending a signal.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_BEW3_1">Brooke</persName>: It would be a
                        practical move.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I will make the
                        point, and also with the American Jewish leaders. All the money is for the
                        Suez Canal Zone. Israel’s withdrawal from the Canal was on the assumption of
                        a massive reconstruction effort as an inducement for peace.</p>
                    <p>The President: Why don’t you discuss a breakdown of the emergency
                        package.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The President
                        determined that one billion would be grant and 1.2 billion credit with an
                        increase of $500 million after a continuation of the negotiation. Our
                        problem was to make a determination at the time that wouldn’t pay too great
                        a cost in the Arab world. It is strongly supported by Israel.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_RJJ_1">Rhodes</persName>: Do we have any
                        understanding about the use of the Suez Canal by all nations, and
                        warships?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Its use is
                        regulated by the Treaty of Constantinople of 1888.<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d33fn7">Also known as the Convention of Constantinople. Signed
                            on October 29, 1888, by representatives of the United Kingdom, the
                            Ottoman Empire, Germany, France, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Italy,
                            Spain, the Netherlands, and Russia, the treaty neutralized the Suez
                            Canal and guaranteed the free passage of ships in times of peace and
                            war.</note> Egypt will regulate the speed of the Canal clearing. They
                        cannot prevent the passage of warships. We don’t think it will change the
                        strategic situation. We have had task forces in the Indian Ocean for months
                        with this in mind. Privately I can tell you that Egypt will allow Israeli
                        cargoes, not Israeli flag ships for now. Israel is happy about this, and
                        most Israeli ships go to Eilat and Haifa; Israel is contented with this.</p>
                    <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Could the
                        Congress help your negotiation?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not by next
                        week, but some sympathetic words would be helpful.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FPHB_1">Frelinghuysen</persName>: You
                        referred to my trip to Egypt. President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                            >Sadat</persName> is very impressive. I asked how we could help. He said
                        “Support <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The more the
                        Canal is rehabilitated, the more stake <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                            >Sadat</persName> has in peace. That is what Israel wants.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_BEW3_1">Brooke</persName>: What do you mean for
                        the contingency fund? Is that for Syria?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Syria’s
                        situation is more complex and <persName corresp="#p_AH_1">Asad</persName> is
                        not a leader like <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>. Russia’s
                        ability to make enemies among the <pb n="183" facs="0214" xml:id="pg_183"
                        />Arabs is phenomenal. <persName corresp="#p_AH_1">Asad</persName> may try a
                        cautious move like <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> did. We then
                        may need some for Syria.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_OTP_1">O’Neill</persName>: When is the bill
                        coming up?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Maybe today.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_ZCJ_1">Zablocki</persName>: What happened
                        to the $750 million?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It went for
                        equipment.</p>
                    <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Doesn’t that
                        mean that without a disengagement agreement it would have cost more?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. This $2.2
                        billion is for the last war. We are seeking a disengagement agreement so we
                        can calmly consider peace.</p>
                    <p>The President: Let’s talk a bit about Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is a
                        painful subject, but remember we accomplished what we set about—to prevent
                        imposition of Communist government. There has been massive infiltration and
                        massive aid by the Soviet Union, China and Eastern Europe. Without that,
                        South Vietnam’s difficulties would largely disappear. Our hope is to put
                        large amounts into South Vietnam now so as to induce self-sustaining growth.
                        We could cut back now, but at the expense of increases in the future. The
                        Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked us to submit a longer term
                        projection for South Vietnam. We are happy to do so. We foresee a down turn
                        in the future if we give enough now.</p>
                    <p>Considering the 50 thousand American dead, the enormous total of wounded, not
                        to spend a few hundred million to get them going seems to be a big mistake.
                        We cut the Ambassador’s recommendation substantially. In large measure the
                        increase was due to the huge increase in the costs of fertilizer and fuel,
                        neither of which is South Vietnam’s fault.</p>
                    <p>On development assistance, we have attempted to respond to the Congressional
                        mandate and emphasize food, health, education.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_OTP_1">O’Neill</persName>: What is the
                        total?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: $4.2 billion.
                        For Indochina $943 million. $650 for Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_BEW3_1">Brooke</persName>: I think one of the
                        problems is coming in perennially. I think a five-year projection would be
                        helpful. I see us on our way out, so we know what we are up against.</p>
                    <p>The President: Projections must recognize the world is changing and our
                        projection would be on the high side.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_AC_1">Albert</persName>: What is it for
                        Israel?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: $300 million in
                            <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> and $50 for Supporting
                        Assistance.</p>
                    <p>The President: That doesn’t include the $2.2.</p>
                    <p>India.</p>
                    <pb n="184" facs="0215" xml:id="pg_184"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: $75 million.</p>
                    <p>Congressman Mahon: We had a hassle in the House over <gloss
                            target="#t_MASF_1">MASF</gloss> increased for South Vietnam from 1.1 to
                        1.6.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is military
                        aid which we can’t really control.</p>
                    <p>The President: You must remember that what we provide South Vietnam is under
                        conditions of a peace agreement on a replacement basis. We are continuing
                        diplomatic initiatives with the Soviet Union to make clear that neither side
                        profits by fueling this conflict. This may not immediately change our
                        five-year projection, but gradually it may, and the more progress we can
                        make, the less it will cost us. The better off we can make the <gloss
                            target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>, the less incentive there is for the
                            <gloss target="#t_DRV_1">DRV</gloss> to start it up again. We know it is
                        unpopular, but we think it is a good investment in peace.</p>
                    <p>On the Middle East, the most unreasonable people supporting Israel are not
                        their government, but the American Jewish community. Look at Israel; it has
                        no natural resources, only courageous people. It’s able to survive only
                        because the United States has poured in massive aid, in amounts which dwarf
                        what we’ve given to Southeast Asia. The United States has stood up,
                        especially last October, to keep the Soviet Union out of the area. When the
                        Soviet Union thought of sending troops . . . none of you want to use U.S.
                        troops . . . the old-line Israeli supporters say just give us the tools and
                        we will do the job; they don’t need military troops. It worked three times,
                        but Israel now knows the Arabs can fight and the old policy is not enough.
                        We need to resolve the dispute. So we have to give heavy aid to Israel to
                        give them the security to have the flexibility to make peace. From Israel’s
                        standpoint, they should not want their neighbors to be supported only by the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>If there is another war, who will pay? We will. That is what the $2.2 is for.
                        So the $250 is an investment to prevent another war.</p>
                    <p>Don’t put this in terms of kicking the Soviet Union out. That is not our
                        policy. Only the United States can bring a peace, but it is not possible if
                        the Soviet Union is against it. What is our policy toward the Soviet Union?
                        This is what I have told <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> and
                        what I will tell <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>—if they
                        think we are trying to drive them out, we have problems, because their
                        hard-liners can’t take that. We don’t seek hegemony, but peace for all, and
                        all states who wish to should play a role. That is the American policy.</p>
                    <p>The Balkans used to be the source of European wars—today the Middle East is
                        the Balkans of the world.</p>
                    <p>Henry has done a masterful job in dealing with those people. For the first
                        time in 1,000 years, there is a chance that if we use skill and <pb n="185"

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BEL_1">Butz</persName>: The political problem of food
                        prices is behind us. We are having a tremendous increase in production.
                        Wheat is 2.2, up 500 million, corn is up 1.5–2 million bales. In 1973 we had
                        record farm income. In 1974 it will be a bit less. Soft spots are cattle and
                        beef; the feeders are now actually losing money. Food prices should stay at
                        this level the rest of the year. Retail margins are widening. Exports will
                        total $21 billion, imports $9 billion—for an 11.5 contribution to the
                        balance of payments. We will use 700 million bushels of wheat—the rest is
                        for export. We need to export half of the soybeans.</p>
                    <p>On food aid and stockpiling, a debate is developing. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> and his friends think we should
                        have a large Government food reserve. I disagree. We are out of the food
                        reserve business and I think we should stay out. We carried the world food
                        reserve and everyone got soft—they didn’t have to plan. We need food
                        reserves, but they can be carried by private industry and foreign
                        governments. We have carried the lion’s share of production aid for years,
                        going back to the Marshall Plan.</p>
                    <p>President: The whole idea that if we feed the world there will be peace is
                        nonsense. But taking an area like the Middle East, if we develop a new
                        relationship with the Arabs, the Middle East is one of the hungriest areas
                        of the world. Food is indispensable in our foreign policy. The Soviet Union
                        is providing arms to the Arabs; we can counter here. If we tried to give
                        arms both to Israel and the Arabs, there would be a hell of a fuss
                        raised.</p>

                    <p>The United States should move away from multilateral to bilateral aid. Keep
                        this in mind at the World Food Conference.<note n="5" xml:id="d34fn5">See

                        policy. As our military assistance recedes, we need other bilateral aid. The

                        this tool for our foreign policy. This has to be closely held, because it
                        goes against the grain of the altruists.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_SJA_1">Scali</persName>: We can count our bilateral
                        aid toward world goals, and we can’t look too selfish.</p>
                    <p>President: OK, but let’s have no illusion that we need to be able to
                        influence governments and what they do. The World Bank does a fine job, but
                        it is not an effective instrument of U.S. foreign policy. Frequently, it has
                        not helped where we wanted and has helped countries where is was not in our
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>One final word, we are not going to solve our budget problems by slashing
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>. We are at a critical juncture in
                        foreign policy. We don’t rule out cuts in <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                            >DOD</gloss>, but that is not our goal. The Soviet Union has a crash
                        program going on and unilateral cuts would be disastrous. India goes nuclear
                        so it can push its weight around a bit in South Asia.</p>
                    <p>We must stay strong not just in order to be number one, but because it is
                        essential for our diplomacy with the Soviet Union, the Chinese, Europe and
                        the rest. If they get the impression the U.S. is turning away from world
                        leadership, we are finished.</p>
                    <p>I want every Department head to look hard at personnel. We all know there can
                        be some cutting. I would rather have the Departments initiate it than do it
                        from the White House.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here are <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s
                        introductory remarks.]</p>
                    <p>When the war ended in Europe and Asia in 1945, America was the only economic
                        and military superpower in the world. Most of Europe <pb n="188" facs="0219"
                            xml:id="pg_188"/>and Japan were in ruins—economically exhausted,
                        politically demoralized. Leadership of a whole free world fell on our
                        shoulders, whether we wanted it or not.</p>
                    <p>Hard as it was, our task at the outset was made easier by our overwhelming
                        material strength and by a strong, unified sense of national purpose.</p>
                    <p>Around the globe, we, as Americans, committed ourselves to halting the
                        advance of communism, to promoting economic development, and even to
                        encouraging other countries to adopt our economic, political, and social
                        ideals.</p>
                    <p>Simplistic and occasionally misguided as this goal may have been, it was a
                        noble and unselfish goal in its enthusiasm. And despite some mistakes which
                        we came to correct, we in our hearts know—and millions in Europe and Japan
                        and in the developing world know—that America’s contribution to mankind in
                        the quarter century after the war was of historic and unprecedented
                        dimensions.</p>
                    <p>And we can be proud that America was as generous in helping our former
                        enemies as we were in aiding our friends.</p>
                    <p>During this same period, the face of the world changed more rapidly and
                        dramatically than ever before in the world’s history. Fifty-eight newly
                        independent nations joined the world community. The once-monolithic
                        Communist bloc was splintered. New centers of power emerged in Europe and
                        Asia.</p>
                    <p>American zeal and innocence were tempered during these years, also. The war
                        in Korea, followed by the long war in Viet-Nam, sapped too much of our
                        national self-confidence and sense of purpose. Our own domestic needs
                        commanded greater attention. And by the later 1960’s, our policy of trying
                        to solve everyone’s problems all over the world was no longer realistic, nor
                        was it necessary.</p>
                    <p>America was no longer a giant, towering over the rest of the world with
                        seemingly inexhaustible resources and a nuclear monopoly.</p>
                    <p>As our overwhelming superiority in power receded, there was a growing threat
                        that we might turn inward, that we might retreat into isolation from our
                        world responsibilities, ignoring the fact that we were, and are still, the
                        greatest force for peace anywhere in the world today.</p>
                    <p>This threat of a new wave of isolationism, blind to both the lessons of the
                        past and the perils of the future, was, and remains today, one of the
                        greatest potential dangers facing our country—because in our era, American
                        isolation could easily lead to global desolation. Whether we like it or not,
                        the alternative to détente is a runaway nuclear arms race, a return to
                        constant confrontation, and a shattering setback to our hopes for building a
                        new structure of peace in the world.</p>
                    <pb n="189" facs="0220" xml:id="pg_189"/>
                    <p>When we came into office in 1969, this administration faced a more complex, a
                        more challenging, and yet in some ways a more promising world situation than
                        that which existed in the post-World War II era.</p>
                    <p>While we could not, and will not, abdicate our responsibilities as the most
                        powerful nation in the free world, it was apparent that the time had come to
                        reassess those responsibilities. This was the guiding purpose of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> doctrine,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d35fn2">See <ref target="#d9fn2">footnote 2, Document
                            9</ref>.</note> a doctrine which says that those we help to enjoy the
                        benefits of freedom should bear a fair share of the burden of its defense as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>It was also clear that both pragmatism and moral force had to be the double
                        prongs of any American foreign policy in the new era. A sense of moral
                        purpose is part of our heritage, and it is part of the tradition of our
                        foreign policy. Pragmatism, realism, and technical efficiency must not be
                        the sole touchstone of our foreign policy. Such a policy would have no roots
                        or inspiration and could not long elicit positive support from the American
                        people and the Congress, and more important, it would not deserve the
                        respect of the world.</p>
                    <p>We had to remember, however, that unrealistic idealism could be impractical
                        and potentially dangerous. It could tempt us to forgo results that were good
                        because we insisted upon results that were perfect.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Resolving Problems With the Soviet Union</p>
                    <p>A blend of the ideal and the pragmatic in our foreign policy has been
                        especially critical in our approach to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The differences between our two systems of life and government are sharp and
                        fundamental. But even as we oppose totalitarianism, we must also keep sight
                        of the hard, cold facts of life in the nuclear age.</p>
                    <p>Ever since the Soviet Union achieved equality in strategic weapons systems,
                        each confrontation has meant a brush with potential nuclear devastation to
                        all civilized nations. Reduction of tensions, therefore, between us has
                        become the foremost requirement of American foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>The United States will not retreat from its principles. The leaders of the
                        Soviet Union will not sacrifice theirs. But as we have the valor to defend
                        those principles which divide us as nations, we must have the vision to seek
                        out those things which unite us as human beings.</p>
                    <p>Together, we share the capacity to destroy forever our common heritage of
                        4,000 years of civilization. Together, we are moving to insure that this
                        will not—because it must not—happen.</p>
                    <p>Slowly and carefully over the past five years, we have worked with the Soviet
                        Union to resolve concrete problems that could deterio<pb n="190" facs="0221"
                            xml:id="pg_190"/>rate into military confrontations. And upon these
                        bridges we are erecting a series of tangible economic and cultural exchanges
                        that will bind us more closely together.</p>
                    <p>The American people are a great people; the Russian people are a great
                        people. These two great people who worked together in war are now learning
                        to work together in peace. Ultimately, we hope that the United States and
                        the Soviet Union will share equally high stakes in preserving a stable
                        international environment.</p>
                    <p>The results of this policy have been heartening. The problem of Berlin, where
                        our nations were at swords’ point for a quarter of a century, has now been
                        resolved by negotiation. Our two countries have concluded an historic
                        agreement to limit strategic nuclear arms.</p>
                    <p>We and our allies have engaged the Soviet Union in negotiations on major
                        issues of European security, including a reduction of military forces in
                        Central Europe. We have substantially reduced the risk of direct U.S.-Soviet
                        confrontation in crisis areas. We have reached a series of bilateral
                        cooperative agreements in such areas as health, environment, space, science
                        and technology, as well as trade.</p>
                    <p>At the Moscow summit in 1972, our Secretary of the Navy, the
                        Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy, signed an agreement on the prevention
                        of incidents on and over the high seas—a code of conduct aimed at
                        eliminating dangerous actions of the cold war era and a code of conduct
                        which has already proved a success.</p>
                    <p>Over the past five years, we have reached more agreements with the Soviet
                        Union than in the entire postwar period preceding that, and this is a record
                        in which all Americans can take pride.</p>
                    <p>In keeping with our efforts to bring America’s foreign policy into line with
                        modern realities, we have also sought to normalize our relations with the
                        People’s Republic of China, where one-fourth of all of the people in the
                        world live, a country with which we shared nothing but confrontation and
                        distrust during a quarter century of cold war.</p>
                    <p>Beginning with an official dialogue opened in 1971, we have negotiated
                        constructive agreements in the areas of trade and scientific and cultural
                        exchanges. We established Liaison Offices in our respective capitals last
                        year. We expect further progress in the years ahead.</p>
                    <p>We have also succeeded, as Admiral Mack<note n="3" xml:id="d35fn3">Vice
                            Admiral William P. Mack, Superintendent of the U.S. Naval

                        Viet-Nam in a manner which gave meaning to the heavy sacrifices we had made
                        and which greatly enhanced the preservation of freedom and stability in
                        Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>One result is that today the 20 million people of South Viet-Nam are free to
                        govern themselves and they are able to defend themselves. <pb n="191"
                            facs="0222" xml:id="pg_191"/>An even more important result is that we
                        have proved again that America’s word is America’s bond.</p>
                    <p>We have preserved the trust of our allies around the world by demonstrating
                        that we are a reliable partner in the defense of liberty; we have earned the
                        respect of our potential adversaries by demonstrating that we are a reliable
                        partner in the search for peace.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Road to Middle East Peace</p>
                    <p>America’s unique and essential contribution to peace is nowhere better
                        demonstrated than in the Middle East. The hate and distrust that has for so
                        long poisoned the relationship between Arabs and Israelis had led to war
                        four times in the last 40 years, and the toll of death and human suffering
                        was immense, while the tension made the Middle East a world tinderbox that
                        could easily draw the United States and the Soviet Union into military
                        confrontation.</p>
                    <p>The need for a stable solution among the regional parties as well as between
                        the great powers was overwhelmingly urgent.</p>
                    <p>The October war of last year, while tragic, also presented a unique
                        opportunity—because for the first time it was clear to us and clear to the
                        moderate leaders of the Arab world that a positive American role was
                        indispensable to achieving a permanent settlement in the Middle East. And it
                        was for this reason that I sent Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> to the Middle East to offer our
                        good offices in the process of negotiation.</p>
                    <p>The results, which reflect more than anything else the vision and
                        statesmanship of the leaders of both sides, have been encouraging. An
                        agreement to separate military forces has been implemented on the
                        Egyptian-Israeli front, and now a similar accord has been negotiated between
                        Israel and Syria.<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4">The Egyptian-Israeli

                        time in a generation, we are witnessing the beginning of a dialogue between
                        the Arab states and Israel.</p>
                    <p>Now, the road to a just and lasting and permanent peace in the Mideast is
                        still long and difficult and lies before us. But what seemed to be an
                        insurmountable roadblock on that road has now been removed, and we are
                        determined to stay on course until we have reached our goal of a permanent
                        peace in that area. The role of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Primary Concern of Foreign Policy</p>
                    <p>In surveying the results of our foreign policy, it is ironic to observe that
                        its achievements now threaten to make us victims of our success. In
                        particular, a dangerous misunderstanding has arisen as to just what détente
                        is and what it is not.</p>
                    <p>Until very recently, the pursuit of détente was not a problem for us in
                        America. We were so engaged in trying to shift international tides away from
                        confrontation toward negotiation that people were generally agreed that the
                        overriding consideration was the establishment of a pattern of peaceful
                        international conduct. But now that so much progress has been made, some
                        take it for granted.</p>
                    <p>Eloquent appeals are now being made for the United States, through its
                        foreign policy, to transform the internal as well as the international
                        behavior of other countries, and especially that of the Soviet Union.<note

                            Literature. He was stripped of his citizenship by the Soviet Government
                            on February 12 and sent into exile in West Germany.</note> This issue
                        sharply poses the dilemma I outlined at the outset. It affects not only our
                        relation with the Soviet Union but also our posture toward many nations
                        whose internal systems we totally disagree with, as they do with ours.</p>
                    <p>Our foreign policy therefore must reflect our ideals, and it must reflect our
                        purposes. We can never, as Americans, acquiesce in the suppression of human
                        liberties. We must do all that we reasonably can to promote justice, and for
                        this reason we continue to adhere firmly to certain humane principles, not
                        only in appropriate international forums but also in our private exchanges
                        with other governments—where this can be effective. But we must recognize
                        that we are more faithful to our ideals by being concerned with results and
                        we achieve more results through diplomatic action than through hundreds of
                        eloquent speeches.</p>
                    <p>But there are limits to what we can do, and we must ask ourselves some very
                        hard questions, questions which I know members of this class have asked
                        themselves many times. What is our capability to change the domestic
                        structure of other nations? Would a slowdown or reversal of détente help or
                        hurt the positive evolution of other social systems? What price, in terms of
                        renewed conflict, are we willing to pay to bring pressure to bear for humane
                        causes?</p>
                    <p>Not by our choice, but by our capability, our primary concern in foreign
                        policy must be to help influence the international conduct of nations in the
                        world arena. We would not welcome the intervention of <pb n="193"
                            facs="0224" xml:id="pg_193"/>other countries in our domestic affairs,
                        and we cannot expect them to be cooperative when we seek to intervene
                        directly in theirs.</p>
                    <p>We cannot gear our foreign policy to transformation of other societies. In
                        the nuclear age, our first responsibility must be the prevention of a war
                        that could destroy all societies.</p>
                    <p>We must never lose sight of this fundamental truth of modern international
                        life: Peace between nations with totally different systems is also a high
                        moral objective.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">An Era of Cooperation</p>
                    <p>The concepts of national security, partnership, negotiation with adversaries,
                        are the central pillars of the structure of peace that this administration
                        has outlined as its objective.</p>
                    <p>If a structure of peace is to endure, it must reflect the contributions and
                        reconcile the aspirations of nations. It must be cemented by the shared goal
                        of coexistence and the shared practice of accommodation. It must liberate
                        every nation to realize its destiny free from the threat of war, and it must
                        promote social justice and human dignity.</p>
                    <p>The structure of peace of which I speak will make possible an era of
                        cooperation in which all nations will apply their separate talents and
                        resources to the solution of problems that beset all mankind: the problems
                        of energy and famine, disease and suffering—problems as old as human history
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>It was with this thought in mind that in February we launched an effort to
                        bring together the principal consumer countries to begin working on the
                        problem of equitably meeting the needs of people throughout the world who
                        are faced with the prospect of increasingly scarce resources—in this case,

                    <p>Each of these missions, in a way, is a reflection of America’s broader hopes
                        and responsibilities. And I say to you gentlemen, these are hopes and

                    <p>Today, each one of you becomes a custodian of a noble tradition of service.
                        As the first class to have begun its studies in the post-Viet-Nam era, it
                        falls to you to serve in such a way that the graduates who follow you in the
                        years to come will enter a U.S. Navy that is strong, that is prepared and is
                        respected, and above all, a Navy and a nation at honorable peace with all
                        nations in the world.</p>
                    <p>One-hundred seventy years ago, after Nelson’s great victory at Trafalgar,
                        Prime Minister William Pitt was honored at a dinner at London’s historic
                        Guildhall. He was hailed as the savior of Europe. He responded to that toast
                        with a brief speech that has been named by Lord Curzon as one of the three
                        masterpieces of English eloquence.</p>
                    <p>Listen to his words: I return you many thanks for the honor you have done me.
                        But no single man will save Europe. England has saved herself by her
                        exertions and will, I trust, save Europe by her example.</p>
                    <p>Today, 170 years later, we can say no single nation can save the world but
                        America can and will save herself by her exertions and will, we trust, by
                        our example, save the cause of peace and freedom for the world.</p>

                                >Nixon</persName> and European leaders signed the Declaration on

                                >Kissinger</persName> remarked in a June 19 news conference, “So far
                            as the United States is concerned, we look at this declaration as an
                            expression by the free countries of the Atlantic area that they will
                            gear their policies to the new realities—that they recognize their
                            destiny as common in the next quarter of a century, as it has been in
                            the last quarter of a century.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                    </p>
                    <p>When I went to Europe in 1969, they thought we should do something about
                        China and relations with the Soviet Union. The problem then for them was a
                        possible <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Soviet confrontation. Since
                        then, European attitudes have turned 180°. They have urged a European
                        Security Conference on us; now they are cooling on it and on the idea of
                        having a summit conclusion. Détente is a period of great opportunity and
                        also of danger for the alliance. The Europeans wanted our assurances on
                        security but they have been less than cooperative on economics, the Middle
                        East, etc. They can’t have it both ways—they can’t keep our forces up and
                        confront us everywhere else. They don’t always have to agree—but they can’t
                        go off on their own and in antagonism. In Brussels, I met with the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAC_1">NAC</gloss> and then individually with Schmidt,
                            <persName corresp="#p_WH_2">Wilson</persName>, Rumor and with others at
                        the reception. Giscard was not there—he is more cooperative but he still
                        depends on the Gaullist forces and he can’t move too fast. The Alliance was
                        invigorated by this. The allies said they would try to strengthen their
                        forces. The Alliance got a security shot in the arm—which is difficult when
                        all of them see the tension receding. On the economic side, we laid the
                        foundation for more cooperation between the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> and the Community. The Europeans’ interests were almost
                        exclusively economics. After talking with them, I wouldn’t exchange our
                        problems for theirs.</p>
                    <p>About Moscow: We didn’t know the type of public reception we would get. There
                        had been differences on the Middle East conflict and the October
                        confrontation. The Soviet approach to the Middle East is to do everything at
                        once. Ours is to use Geneva but also anything else which is helpful. They
                        insist on having the Palestinians and immediate withdrawal to the ’67
                        frontiers. That would blow up any conference. Thanks to Henry, we have
                        cooled the area. Therefore the positions of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> and Soviet Union were far apart.</p>
                    <p>The discussions this year were the fullest and the least belligerent, and the
                        relationships were “friendliest” in the proper interpretation of <pb n="197"
                            facs="0228" xml:id="pg_197"/>that term. We have laid over the years the
                        groundwork for laying the hard problems out on the table, discussing them
                        frankly, not giving up about disagreements but to continue to grapple. The
                        Soviet Union now has positive interest in good relations with the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>In the bilateral area, it can’t be said that these nonsecurity agreements
                        will keep them from confrontation with us when our interests clash; but each
                        one gives them an incentive not to throw over détente. We signed some new
                        agreements—in economics, housing, energy, and on research on the artificial
                        heart. These don’t get much play.</p>
                    <p>Then we discussed the international field. Europe. The Soviet Union wants a
                            <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> summit. We agree we’ll do it if
                        the substance warrants. On the Middle East, they accepted the proposal that
                        we must continue bilateral step-by-step efforts but they insist on playing a
                        role and even more so on an early Geneva Conference. Our position is—if you
                        take the steps remaining, to get a pull-back on both fronts, the West Bank
                        and the Palestinians—if you lay it all out in Geneva, everyone there would
                        oppose us and Israel. So they don’t agree, but will go along with some
                        bilateral efforts—but we can’t say this publicly.</p>
                    <p>Southeast Asia was also mentioned.</p>
                    <p>In the strategic area, we made some progress which if it happened two years
                        ago would have been monumental. On <gloss target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss>, we
                        agreed to go to one site. Their field covers not only Moscow but also much
                        of their industry and a missile field.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>: The Soviet Union proposed it. Their
                        motives are that we are far ahead in testing. They are worried about the
                        Chinese, so the threshold at 150KT makes sense. Our military think that more
                        testing is essential but fundamentally a comprehensive test ban is
                        unverifiable. We won’t yet submit the <gloss target="#t_TTB_1">TTB</gloss>
                        because of the side issue of peaceful nuclear explosions. We will work out
                        agreement on <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>. They have agreed on prior
                        announcement and observers. It’s the first on-site inspection ever
                        agreed.</p>
                    <p>On environmental warfare, we agreed to talks. While it doesn’t seem important
                        now, but who knows what science will bring?</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> is the toughest of all, as I told you
                        before. The Soviet throw weight is greater but our advantage is enormous—we
                        have a 3.5-to-1 advantage in warheads and also in sophistication and
                        accuracy. As we look to the future, if the Soviet Union agreed to freeze
                        now, it would be freezing itself into a public position of inferiority—which
                        they won’t do. The Soviet Union has a missile advantage, but you get hit by
                        warheads. We would first discuss this, but our own warhead advantage doesn’t
                        include our allies—but they count them. They are also worried about China;
                        and we might have to be also. In 1972, I had a rough 4½ <pb n="198"

                        been a Vietnam settlement or the present Middle East situation. What we come
                        up with now was an agreement to conclude a 10-year agreement on quantitative
                        and qualitative steps. We have to choose whether to conclude an agreement
                        which will protect us and yet be acceptable to them or, with their <gloss
                            target="#t_MIRV_1">MIRV</gloss> breakthrough, go into a race which we
                        will win but which would leave neither side really better off. There comes a
                        point where it makes no difference who has the most. Those are our
                        choices—negotiate a decent agreement or increase our defense and race with
                        them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: At one point, we told
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> what he would have with
                        MIRVs; he confirmed our intelligence estimate. Then he told us what we had,
                        which included everything—bombers, overseas bases, everything. We never
                        think this way, because we think of second-strike. The significance is that
                        they can’t hit <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> without fearing we
                        will hit them as they cannot hit us, or if they hit <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>, we will still have enough.</p>
                    <p>The President: I had a talk with <persName corresp="#p_GMA_1"
                            >Grechko</persName>. We agreed that Henry would go back this fall. We
                        have narrowed the differences. There is still a gulf, but we hope we can
                        agree on something. If we can’t, they will go balls out, and with their
                        throw weight, it will be a problem. It would be a race no one would win. We
                        are laying the groundwork for a longer-term agreement.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_AGD_1">Aiken</persName>: What effect will the
                        French development have?</p>
                    <p>The President: The Soviet Union puts great emphasis on French and British
                        developments—and also the Chinese. Looked at coldly, they are
                        mini-powers.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: After France has finished
                        its program in 1980, they will have one half as many warheads as we have on
                        one Poseidon.</p>
                    <p>The President: The last thing the Europeans want is for us to be more
                        inferior to the Soviet Union, but they also fear a runaway race.</p>
                    <p>A Senator: Where is China? Better than France?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not much better. They
                        will have one-third as many as one Poseidon by 1978.</p>
                    <p>The President: But the Soviet Union thinks the Chinese are going much
                        faster.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Also, how much is enough?
                        The Chinese in four years could kill millions of Russians, and might accept
                        millions of Chinese killed.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MJJ_2">McFall</persName>: What would be a reasonable
                        agreement? Can they both agree?</p>
                    <p>The President: We think so. It is very complex. All systems must be
                        considered. We can’t discuss numbers now. Our general view is that all of us
                        concerned with this must not adopt the view of why bother to try for an
                        agreement because we could win a race. But we don’t want a bigger
                        budget—neither do the Soviets—but lacking an agreement, we will move and
                        have told them so.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_PJO_1">Pastore</persName>: We have had a deterrent
                        policy for 25 years. Our military now think there could be a limited nuclear
                        war. That is impossible. Do the Soviets think that?</p>
                    <p>The President: The Soviets believe in inevitable escalation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Soviet weapons are not
                        geared that way.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_PJO_1">Pastore</persName>: Then why have more
                        artillery shells?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We must distinguish
                        between battlefield and strategic.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PJO_1">Pastore</persName>: A President shouldn’t have
                        to make a holocaust decision because artillery shells are 30 miles from the
                        front.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We agree, but then we
                        need more conventional forces.</p>
                    <p>The President: That is the point. More and more weapons won’t help us.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_PJO_1">Pastore</persName>: Let the Germans put up the
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The tough speeches the
                        President made last spring have brought the Europeans to fundamentals. The
                        changes in Germany and France have been very helpful.</p>
                    <p>The Europeans now also see that our energy institutions were far-sighted.
                        They all wanted to talk energy. They are all running balance of payments
                        deficits because of oil prices. Also the new deposits coming in are
                        short-term and lending is on a long-term basis. They now realize we weren’t
                        talking hegemony but enlightened self-interest to keep Europe healthy. The
                        Europeans now want to cooperate. France has been stuck with exorbitant oil

                        well that Giscard now wants to cooperate if he can do it without publicly
                        reversing his course.</p>
                    <p>On the previous summits, the Europeans feared condominium. This time most
                        felt it was successful—it contributed to easing the atmosphere; they liked
                        the measured way we are proceeding; and it encouraged progress on <gloss

                            >MBFR</gloss>. I made good progress on those two without backbiting. The
                        most troublesome things are <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> domestic
                        carping over <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> inferiority. Spain asked
                        about <persName corresp="#p_ZERJ_1">Zumwalt</persName>’s comment on <pb

                        confrontations. We must get the Europeans to strengthen their forces. The
                        Soviet Union can’t get superiority strategically, but at some level, though,
                        strategic forces cancel each other out and conventional forces become
                        critical.</p>
                    <p>They are okay on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, but they don’t know
                        enough to discuss the details. Their concern is to look into the future and
                        their concern is economic.</p>
                    <p>Italy is in bad shape. Talking to them is like talking to a Harvard
                        professor’s seminar. With the communists and fascists, the democratic
                        factions have little maneuver. They are tempted to move to the communists
                        and we told them that would be dangerous.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SHD_1">Scott</persName>: Isn’t it time they have
                        decent alternatives?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, they need able
                        democratic parties to govern. In France, Giscard wants to cooperate; he has
                        no hangups. They just need time and must maneuver carefully. Whatever
                        France’s policy, as long as they don’t bring pressure on their allies, we
                        can work it out.</p>
                    <p>Schmidt has none of <persName corresp="#p_BW_1">Brandt</persName>’s rapid
                            [<hi rend="italic">vapid</hi>?] sentimentality. Where a year ago they
                        thought we needed them, that has changed. In the Middle East they see we are
                        right and we are urging them to move in economics, as long as it is
                        supportive.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BHFJ_1">Byrd</persName>: What were the issues that
                        were impossible of resolution?</p>

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There are words being
                        thrown around. Take throw weight. Married with MIRVs and high accuracy, they
                        can be dangerous against fixed targets—so they are more vulnerable than we.
                        So far things have not gone to maximum MIRVing. If we can keep it there, we
                        are okay. But if they put 20 MIRVs on a missile, it would be a problem.
                        Also, we can put a big missile in the Minuteman III silos if need be.</p>

                        look bad. Also, most of the buildup is coming just at the end of the
                        extended period. We thought if we could extend the time, we could put a cap
                        on numbers which is below the capacity of each side and slow down the arms
                        race. It’s still large numbers, but the instability comes from each racing.
                        There is no way an attack on the United States could leave us with less than
                        4,000 warheads.</p>
                    <p>The President: An agreement means nothing unless it means both sides restrict
                        what they would otherwise do.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We could have juggled the
                        numbers, but it would have been hard to justify that it was less than their
                        program. We want either to restrict them or to be sure they refuse to be
                        limited.</p>
                    <p>The economic agreement doesn’t involve transfer of resources. They facilitate
                        trade.</p>
                    <p>There is a myth developing that détente is one sided. But:</p>
                    <p>(1) We settled Vietnam on our terms.</p>
                    <p>(2) We squeezed them in the Middle East in an unbelievable way.</p>
                    <p>(3) We protected Berlin.</p>
                    <p>(4) We stopped a Cuban submarine base.</p>
                    <p>What did they get? Some Ex-Im credits, a little trade, some wheat—which was
                        not part of détente. We tie everything to good foreign policy behavior. If
                        we prevent benefits to them, they will go back to the cold war.</p>
                    <p>The President: The balance of trade with the Soviet Union is very
                        favorable.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And if we don’t trade,
                        the Europeans and Japanese already are doing it, and it’s better if it’s
                        done under our close controls than without them.</p>
                    <p>The President: We are trying to work out methods how a private trading
                        economy can trade with a state system. Also, it will eventually pertain to
                        the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Look at the record. Every
                        time they have moved, we have been tough. We have showed them if they move
                        militarily, we will stop them. Conversely, if they cooperate, we will make
                        it useful. Remember, until the 1972 summit, there was no trade at all.</p>
                    <p>When you get the Soviet leadership and news talking the success of détente,
                        it gives them a stake—though they can change.</p>
                    <p>We have paralyzed the left in Europe with this policy. What would happen if
                        we had one crisis after another? There were no commitments as to loans, or
                        transfer of resources.</p>
                    <p>The President: We told them we couldn’t yet get <gloss target="#t_MFN_1"
                            >MFN</gloss> but we’re working on it.</p>
                    <p>Three things moved them at this summit:</p>
                    <p>(1) What will happen with China? Will they force us into détente with China
                        and opposition to them?</p>
                    <p>(2) Why didn’t they react in Vietnam and the Middle East? Why did they settle
                        Berlin: (1) fear of the tough United States. They are still obsessed with
                        World War II. The people were out, and they could not do it just for peace
                        but for friendship. Good relations with the United States is in their
                        interest. They are doing better but they are far behind <pb n="202"
                            facs="0233" xml:id="pg_202"/>Europe and even more so, the United States.
                        (2) The more stake we can give the Soviet leadership and people in peace and
                        cooperation, the more they will lose if détente fails.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss>—you can say: “cut them off”—but it
                        applies in spades to the Chinese. But the more we can give them a stake in
                        good relations, the more we can influence them. If we can get the trade
                            bill,<note n="7" xml:id="d36fn7">See <ref target="#d31">Document
                                31</ref>.</note> it may improve trade, and it will be more help on
                        Jewish emigration than if we slam the door. In 1969 there were less than
                        1,000 per year; last year it was 33,000. This year it’s down, probably
                        because of the October War. So we need them to fear us but also there has to
                        be a positive element to give them an incentive. There is no give-away.
                        There will have to be a quid pro quo, but no unilateral giveaways. Without
                            <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss>, they certainly won’t change their
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>Cederburg: Any thought to sending the Secretary of Defense to Moscow?</p>
                    <p>The President: It might be good for someone to talk to <persName

                    <p>The President: That is not what the leadership is saying. But it is a

                    <p>—The <gloss target="#t_DCI_1">DCI</gloss> is to prepare by Saturday morning
                        (August 10) a list of 40 Committee issues.</p>
                    <p>—The <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> will consider and inform General
                            <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName> of the matters they
                        plan to discuss in their meeting with the President scheduled for August
                        13.</p>
                    <p>—The State and Defense Departments will prepare a list of U.S. commitments to
                        foreign countries that the President should be aware of.</p>
                    <p>—Reconnaisance flights should be restored to their customary level as soon as
                        the new President is sworn in.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This won’t be a
                        long meeting, but there are a number of things the Vice President has asked
                        me to get done. First, he will sign a directive to the Departments this
                        afternoon continuing the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> system as it
                        presently exists. Second, the flow of papers to the President on national
                        security matters will remain the same—through the Office of the Assistant to
                        the President (for National Security Affairs). The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> system will obviously have to be more active, at least in
                        the initial period. After any new policies have been clearly established,
                        perhaps it can slow down some. But for the present, we will go back to the
                        more formal tendencies of the earlier <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> Administration. The Vice President is extremely
                        interested in getting all the options. He does not just want the positions
                        of the various Departments. So you should each get your Departments
                        organized along these lines.</p>
                    <p>There will be an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting tomorrow
                        morning for about 15 minutes. We’ll let you know the time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Will you need a <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> briefing?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, this will be
                        an organizational meeting for the President to affirm the continuity of our
                        foreign policy and procedures. There will probably be another more
                        substantive <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting in about 10 days
                        and I would appreciate your suggestions as to the most urgent problems that
                        require consideration in the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. We will
                        have to discuss <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> at an early meeting
                        but probably not within 10 days.</p>
                    <p>Tomorrow, Saturday, there will be a Cabinet meeting, followed by the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting. That will be for statutory
                        members and advisers only.</p>

                    <p>The President wants from the Departments brief briefing papers on the key
                        issues. Also (to <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>) he wants a
                        brief summary of the world situation from the intelligence point of
                        view.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: We’ve already done that in
                        this morning’s National Intelligence Daily.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m going to get
                        that thing abolished! I just can’t take seriously anything that looks like a
                        newspaper! How do other people feel about that format?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: We sent out a
                        questionnaire and most people like it. The President has been reading both
                        the <gloss target="#t_PDB_1">PDB</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_NID_1"
                            >NID</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He wants the
                            <gloss target="#t_PDB_1">PDB</gloss>. I didn’t ask him specifically
                        about the <gloss target="#t_NID_1">NID</gloss>, but go on sending it to him
                        until we find out what he wants.</p>
                    <p>(to Clements) The President also needs to know what you consider the major
                        issues in the Defense area that require decision.</p>
                    <p>(to Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>) The President will
                        meet with the Chiefs on Tuesday. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                            >Schlesinger</persName> should be there and I will be there. (to
                        Clements) I’ll find out about your attendance. That meeting will be in the
                        White House. (to Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>) We
                        would welcome your ideas on what should be discussed. Would you want to
                        brief him on the five-year plans of the services in terms of force
                        levels?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: We could, but I wonder
                        whether that is the best approach. That’s a lot of detail. We might better
                        tell him what forces we have and where they are—what we’re doing.<note n="4"

                        purpose of the meeting will be to establish a relationship between the
                        Chiefs and the President. Whatever the Chiefs think is most important for
                        him to know as Commander in Chief.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He is getting a

                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: Yes, in December.</p>

                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: It might be helpful for
                        him to know what he might be called on to do under certain circumstances.
                        What his options are.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Sometimes the
                        military are reluctant to be specific on what they want to do for fear the
                        civilians will stop them from doing it. My experience has been that a
                        President will act forcefully and with confidence if he knows what he can
                        do. Give him a sense of what we have and what it gives him a chance to do.
                        What are our actual capabilities—in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>,
                            <gloss target="#t_SAC_1">SAC</gloss>, etc.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: He has been to <gloss
                            target="#t_SAC_1">SAC</gloss> for a briefing.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He’s confident
                        on the <gloss target="#t_SIOP_1">SIOP</gloss>, and he will be getting the
                        decision elements this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clements: <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Jim (Schlesinger)</persName>, Gen.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> and I will talk and come
                        up with something.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The idea of
                        deployments is a good one. We want to make the point that the Chiefs are the
                        central feature on the military side. The Defense budget issues will come
                        later. (to <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>) Is he up-to-date
                        on <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: He came out to visit us
                        about three months ago. And we have had a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                            >CIA</gloss> officer assigned to him who has seen him almost every
                        day.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Who was
                        that?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: [<hi rend="italic">name
                            not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (to <persName
                            corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>) Can you pull together a list of all
                        40 Committee actions—whatever he needs to know about the 40 Committee—by
                        tomorrow morning?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Sure.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Also, each
                        Department should prepare a list of U.S. commitments to foreign
                        countries—such things as nuclear arrangements, for example—that he should
                        know about. These will be primarily Defense, I suppose.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clements: We might cover these in our issues briefings.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have two
                        additional observations: First, and my own department probably needs this
                        more than anyone but I will direct my remarks to all. It is very important
                        that there be no adverse comment to the effect that the conduct of foreign
                        policy has been affected by Watergate. We must behave with dignity to a man
                        who made major and courageous decisions in foreign policy. We must cast no
                        aspersions on a man who performed great services for this nation. Second, it
                        is most important that we give the impression of a united government. If
                        anyone should decide to take a run at us, we would probably over-react, if
                        anything. The Vice President is determined to have a very rapid transition.
                        He is sending about 45 messages to Heads <pb n="208" facs="0239"

                            9. In remarks to the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Ambassadors,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> indicated that he
                            would continue to serve as both the President’s Assistant for National
                            Security Affairs and Secretary of State. According to a memorandum of
                            conversation, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> “noted
                            that those in attendance had been serving in the United States during a
                            difficult and tragic period in America’s history. However, he went on to
                            say that the content of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> foreign
                            policy had not been impaired by the domestic problems which President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> had faced. United
                            States foreign policy he said has bipartisan support, and for this
                            reason the continuity of our foreign policy is assured.” (Ibid.,
                            Presidential Agency File, Box 15, <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, 8/12/74–9/30/74)</note> and I will see the remaining ones
                        tomorrow at the State Department. There will be very visible continuity. We
                        will have meetings with <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> and
                        King Hussein next week. We will also plan to have a substantive meeting of
                        this group the middle of next week.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clements: (to Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>) Do you
                        want to tell Henry about the message you sent out yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: I sent a message to all
                        the unified commanders yesterday (reads message). We told them to increase
                        their diligence and to move with extreme caution in areas which might be
                        seen as provocatory—told them to take appropriate measures and to report
                        back to me. All the reactions were quite reasoned. We did pull back some
                        risky reconnaisance missions.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m not sure
                        about that; it will be noted, won’t it? Can we resume the reconnaisance this
                        afternoon?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: Yes. We did fly the SR–71
                        mission last night.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s restore
                        the reconnaisance to its previous levels as soon as the Vice President is
                        sworn in. We should show no unusual concerns.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: We’ll resume
                        reconnaisance this afternoon. We’ve increased our intelligence watch.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The message was
                        a very good idea; you were right to do it. We will send you a message for
                        the Armed Forces from the President by 2:00 p.m. today,<note n="7"

                        again Monday or Tuesday to review where transition stands. Let’s aim for
                        Tuesday, so I’ll need the papers Monday. The President will speak to the

                        the period of transition to familiarize the President with the issues and
                        people. After about six months, meetings could be less frequent.</p>
                    <p>—Attendance will be decided by the President on the basis of a list which he
                        will receive and approve before each meeting.</p>
                    <p>—The next meeting will take up the question of Israeli economic and military
                        requests.</p>
                    <p>—Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> will brief the

                        but rather to talk about the procedures we should follow, how often we
                        should meet, and perhaps to focus in a little on subjects we might want to
                        take up. First, I want to say that the Foreign Policy and the Military
                        Policy have been the hallmark of the previous Administration. No
                        Administration in my lifetime ever did better in those fields. I want to
                        congratulate all of you who participated in that for the work which was
                        done. It was a great accomplishment. A good share of my Congressional
                        service was on the Committee on Appropriations, in particular, on the
                        Subcommittees on Defense, Foreign Aid, and as you know, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CWE_1">Bill (Colby)</persName>, on <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                            >CIA</gloss>. That service was important not only in a substantive way,
                        but also it enabled me to get to know the people in the Congress who dealt
                        with these matters, also to get to know the military. I want you all to know
                        that I consider the military a very fine group of people. I saw the Chairman
                        of the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> and the Chiefs, and the working
                        level in the military establishment, frequently. They are absolutely
                        dedicated and we should all be proud of them. [To General <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown] George</persName>, I want you to express my
                        feelings to our military personnel. [General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1"
                            >Brown</persName> assured the President that he would do so.]<note n="3"

                    </p>
                    <p>The previous system that was used in the previous Administration produced
                        results and I feel that we should continue it. My general view is that if
                        you have a system that works and produces, you should continue it as in the
                        past. I don’t have a view, however, on how often we should meet and I would
                        appreciate hearing your views.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. President, I
                        would recommend that, at the beginning, we meet every two weeks to get a
                        clear picture of the issues and direction of policy. It also would give you
                        an opportunity to get a feel for the thinking of your principal advisors;
                        then later, after perhaps six months, meetings could be less frequent.</p>
                    <p>The President: I like that idea. It sounds about right to me. What do you
                        think, <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Jim (Schlesinger)</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: Sir, I believe
                        that is an excellent idea. We do not want to press heavily on your schedule.
                        However, sir, if you feel that this might have the effect of making your
                        schedule too tight, perhaps every three weeks would be often enough.</p>
                    <p>The President: Well, I will just make the time available. I want to meet with
                        this group. So let us plan to meet, at the beginning, every two <pb n="213"
                            facs="0244" xml:id="pg_213"/>weeks. Let us program it that way. Are
                        those present today the regular members of the Council?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. President,
                        these are the statutory members and statutory advisors. The Director of the
                        Office of Emergency Preparedness used to be a member, but that office is now
                        phased out. Actually, it had become less and less involved in the important
                        national security issues. In any event, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> asked Attorney General <persName
                            corresp="#p_MJN_1">John Mitchell</persName> to be a regular member of
                        the Council and later also asked Treasury Secretary Connally, but these were
                        members designated by him and not statutory members. Others, in addition to
                        the statutory members, can be designated at the pleasure of the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>The President: Well, in other words, we could have others here depending upon
                        the subject if we want to do so. For now, at least, let’s keep it this way.
                        I also would like to have the group use both sides of the table for seating
                        so that we can be closer together and facing each other as much as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I also should
                        note, Mr. President, that the Deputy Secretaries of State and Defense are
                        here as well. They are not statutory members, but have usually attended
                        because they have a great deal to do with the implementation of decisions
                        which you may take. Also, in the case of the Deputy Secretary of State, he
                        acts as the representative of the Department of State at the meeting in my
                        stead, since at most <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meetings I serve
                        at the meeting as your Assistant for National Security Affairs.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: Mr. President,
                        I would like to be able to bring <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Bob
                            Ellsworth</persName> with me to the meetings in addition to Deputy
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President: Well, I have known Bob for a long time. He is your
                        international man. Is that correct?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: One way to
                        decide on the attendance would be to have you decide upon a list of proposed
                        attendees before each meeting.</p>
                    <p>The President: Yes, I will do it that way. I can see that <persName
                            corresp="#p_ERF_1">Bob Ellsworth</persName> could be helpful in some
                        situations. On the other hand, I don’t suppose that he would be involved in
                        discussions of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, for example. So we
                        might have some different attendance depending on the nature of the meeting.
                        I will plan on approving who should come on the basis of a list which I will
                        receive before each meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Sir, I would like to
                        comment on Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1"
                            >Ingersoll</persName>’s role and my own. We are members of the principal
                        sub-groups of the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> system. Along with
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName> and General <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>, we make up the core groups of each
                        of those <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> bodies. All of the staff work
                        within the system is performed under <pb n="214" facs="0245" xml:id="pg_214"
                        />us operating in those bodies. It is in that context that we are here and I
                        find it extremely helpful to me.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, they have
                        the operational responsibility.</p>
                    <p>The President: I like to have a staff person at meetings in order that I do
                        not have to call staff in after a meeting and pass on to them all of the
                        discussions and decisions that have been taken, myself. I agree that
                        Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> should be here. They could be
                        helpful in getting decisions implemented. Does anyone have any other
                        comment?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: Sir, there are
                        two issues I believe you will want to focus on in the National Security
                        Council as a matter of priority. The first involves our nuclear strategy.
                        During the last six months, based from a <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                            >NSDM</gloss> approved by <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>,
                        we have altered the nuclear strategy of the U.S. and our deterrent
                        declaratory strategy.<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4">
                            <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 242, “Policy for Planning the
                            Employment of Nuclear Weapons,” January 17, 1974, is scheduled for
                            publication in <ref target="frus1969-76v35">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969–1976, volume XXXV,
                                National Security Policy, 1973–1976</ref>.</note> We think it would
                        be very desirable at an early opportunity to discuss this strategy with you.
                        We believe that it enhances our deterrent capability. The second question
                        concerns our armament policy toward Israel. We are under great pressure from
                        the Israelis. They have proposed a very large military aid package. If you
                        are going to decide upon this, it will be a matter which you will probably
                        want to focus on very early as one of the most pressing decisions. The
                        pressure on Defense is extremely great, and they will be putting great
                        pressure on Congress as well. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> may wish to comment on this.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I had mentioned
                        this briefly earlier, Mr. President. The Israelis want a five-year
                        commitment of $1.5 billion per year. Obviously this involves the most
                        profound foreign policy and military policy issues.</p>
                    <p>The President: Do they want all grant?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, there
                        would be some mix of cash and credit. We must remember, however, that last
                        year the Saudis imposed an oil embargo when we were talking about a package
                        of $2.2 billion in the middle of a war. Now we are talking about a package
                        of plus $5 billion. While negotiations are going on this could be a massive
                        problem with the Arabs. There will be, however, great pressures. Jim is
                        right on that. They will be pushing hard; they want authorization from the
                        Congress this year even if they don’t get the appropriation.</p>
                    <p>The President: What is the status of the $2.2 billion program? We have
                        committed all of the funds under that program and also have committed the
                        $300 million plan for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1975. They are now
                        in the posi<pb n="215" facs="0246" xml:id="pg_215"/>tion of having to decide
                        whether to go on with their military program. They should tap into their own
                        foreign exchange or seek more direct aid from the U.S., and they are pushing
                        for the latter course.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If you want to
                        avoid the longer term foreign policy issues, which a massive program of this
                        kind would generate, you might make a decision on only one year and at a
                        lower level than they are asking. The impact on the Arabs this year would
                        not be as bad as an agreement for a large package for the long term impact,
                        but we need to relate whatever we do to the on-going process of
                        negotiations. If we can show progress in negotiations, the Arabs can swallow
                        military aid decisions, but if we make military aid to Israel decisions in
                        the context of a stalemate in negotiations, we will have a massive
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: I agree we could have a
                        very serious problem if we are not extremely cautious in dealing with this
                        Israeli aid proposal. We could face another oil embargo.</p>
                    <p>The President: Thought also has to be given to this Israeli request in the
                        context of the $250 million request for Egypt. We just have to recognize the
                        political realities on the Hill. Has the Egypt request been submitted
                        yet?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes sir, I
                        believe it is being marked up now.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: It has been marked
                        up on the House side.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: We also have to be
                        concerned with the question of Egypt’s military needs. That issue could be a
                        serious one.</p>
                    <p>The President: Well, let us not get involved in that question now. Let us
                        concentrate on getting the economic aid situation straightened out.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: There is a
                        shorter term problem in the Israeli military aid picture also. They are
                        requesting immediate delivery of much of the material which was in the $2.2
                        billion package. They see a possible war as early as November when the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> forces are removed. They consider
                        this a very real threat for which they want to be prepared now. To the
                        extent we provide some of the equipment that they have asked for, we must
                        take it away from the U.S. forces with the result that those forces will be
                        much less ready.</p>
                    <p>The President: Do they understand that that is the case?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: Yes sir, but
                        they consider that their needs take priority.</p>
                    <p>The President: That certainly is an unselfish attitude.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are studying
                        this entire Israeli aid problem in the interagency system and I think we
                        would want to have that study completed for your consideration.</p>
                    <p>The President: I would like to make that a matter of priority and consider
                        that as a subject for our next meeting in two weeks.</p>
                    <pb n="216" facs="0247" xml:id="pg_216"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJOJ_1">Marsh</persName>: Mr. President, I suggest
                        also at the meeting in two weeks you might like to have a briefing on the
                        various groups that operate within the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I suggest that
                        perhaps I might be able to go over that with you directly, Mr. President,
                        rather than in the format of a meeting.</p>
                    <p>The President: Yes, I would like to do that, but I think we can do it
                        directly as you suggest, Henry. Bill (to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1"
                            >Colby</persName>), what is the latest on our ship project in the

                            Ocean since August 1968. The mission, organized by the U.S. intelligence
                            community and codeworded Azorian, was only partially successful.</note>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Well sir, as you know, the
                        tines were damaged when we picked up the sub and we lost [<hi rend="italic"
                            >less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] of the ship. However, we have
                        the rest of it inside the recovery ship and the ship has now steamed away
                        from the area. The Soviet tug, which was in the area, has left the area. We
                        are confident that it was only there in connection with its normal servicing
                        of Soviet submarines. Our ship is now steaming on the way to Hawaii. It is
                        very hard to tell what they have, but they have detected some radioactivity.
                            [<hi rend="italic">7½ lines not declassified</hi>] There may be some
                        pieces on the bottom which could be recovered. They may have fallen loose.
                        We think that at least one of the missiles was loose and it may have fallen
                        free, but it will be some time before we know just what the situation is. It
                        is too bad that, with the whole mission having gone so very well, we lost
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] of the
                        target.</p>

                    <p>The President: Is this a regular operating submarine?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: It is a regular submarine,
                        but it has been especially configured for this task. Actually, it is a very
                        old ship and will soon be decommissioned.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: I would emphasize,
                        however, sir, that although it is a regular operating submarine, it is a
                        very special operation.</p>
                    <p>The President: If it’s an old one, I wonder if it could be the submarine that
                        Mrs. Ford commissioned.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: No sir, it is a
                        different ship.</p>
                    <p>The President: Well, I just wondered because it occurred to me that if they
                        thought we were doing it direct like this with a submarine which my wife had
                        commissioned, I wonder how they would view it. They <pb n="217" facs="0248"
                            xml:id="pg_217"/>would really think we are up to something. I am glad it
                        is not the same ship.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, if there is nothing else, I suggest we adjourn and I thank you all

                    <p>[Omitted here are <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>’s introductory
                        remarks and a discussion of domestic policy.]</p>
                    <p>Successful foreign policy is an extension of the hopes of the whole American
                        people for a world of peace and orderly reform and orderly freedom. So, I
                        would say a few words to our distinguished guests from the governments of
                        other nations where, as at home, it is my determination to deal openly with
                        allies and adversaries.</p>
                    <p>Over the past 5½ years in Congress and as Vice President, I have fully
                        supported the outstanding foreign policy of President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>. This policy I intend to
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my public service, starting with wartime naval duty under the
                        command of President <persName corresp="#p_RFD_1">Franklin D.
                            Roosevelt</persName>, I have upheld all our Presidents when they spoke
                        for my country to the world. I believe the Constitution commands this. I
                        know that in this crucial area of international policy I can count on your
                        firm support.</p>
                    <p>Now, let there be no doubt or any misunderstanding anywhere, and I emphasize
                        anywhere: There are no opportunities to exploit, should anyone so desire.
                        There will be no change of course, no relaxation of vigilance, no
                        abandonment of the helm of our ship of state as the watch changes.</p>
                    <p>We stand by our commitments and we will live up to our responsibilities in
                        our formal alliances, in our friendships, and in our improving relations
                        with potential adversaries.</p>
                    <p>On this, Americans are united and strong. Under my term of leadership, I hope
                        we will become more united. I am certain America will remain strong.</p>
                    <pb n="218" facs="0249" xml:id="pg_218"/>
                    <p>A strong defense is the surest way to peace. Strength makes détente
                        attainable. Weakness invites war, as my generation—my generation—knows from
                        four very bitter experiences.</p>
                    <p>Just as America’s will for peace is second to none, so will America’s
                        strength be second to none.</p>
                    <p>We cannot rely on the forbearance of others to protect this Nation. The power
                        and diversity of the Armed Forces, active Guard and Reserve, the resolve of
                        our fellow citizens, the flexibility in our command to navigate
                        international waters that remain troubled are all essential to our
                        security.</p>
                    <p>I shall continue to insist on civilian control of our superb military
                        establishment. The Constitution plainly requires the President to be
                        Commander in Chief, and I will be.</p>
                    <p>Our job will not be easy. In promising continuity, I cannot promise
                        simplicity. The problems and challenges of the world remain complex and
                        difficult. But we have set out on a path of reason, of fairness, and we will
                        continue on it.</p>
                    <p>As guideposts on that path, I offer the following:</p>
                    <p>—To our allies of a generation in the Atlantic community and Japan, I pledge
                        continuity in the loyal collaboration on our many mutual endeavors.</p>
                    <p>—To our friends and allies in this hemisphere, I pledge continuity in the
                        deepening dialog to define renewed relationships of equality and
                        justice.</p>
                    <p>—To our allies and friends in Asia, I pledge a continuity in our support for
                        their security, independence, and economic development. In Indochina, we are
                        determined to see the observance of the Paris agreement on Vietnam and the
                        cease-fire and negotiated settlement in Laos. We hope to see an early
                        compromise settlement in Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>—To the Soviet Union, I pledge continuity in our commitment to the course of
                        the past 3 years. To our two peoples, and to all mankind, we owe a continued
                        effort to live and, where possible, to work together in peace, for in a
                        thermonuclear age there can be no alternative to a positive and peaceful
                        relationship between our nations.</p>
                    <p>—To the People’s Republic of China, whose legendary hospitality I
                            enjoyed,<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">

                        serious and objective mutual interests and has become an enduring feature of

                    <p>—To the nations in the Middle East, I pledge continuity in our vigorous
                        efforts to advance the progress which has brought hopes of peace to that
                        region after 25 years as a hotbed of war. We shall carry out our promise to
                        promote continuing negotiations among all parties for a complete, just, and
                        lasting settlement.</p>
                    <p>—To all nations, I pledge continuity in seeking a common global goal: a
                        stable international structure of trade and finance which reflects the
                        interdependence of all peoples.</p>
                    <p>—To the entire international community—to the United Nations, to the world’s
                        nonaligned nations, and to all others—I pledge continuity in our dedication
                        to the humane goals which throughout our history have been so much of
                        America’s contribution to mankind.</p>
                    <p>So long as the peoples of the world have confidence in our purposes and faith
                        in our word, the age-old vision of peace on Earth will grow brighter.</p>
                    <p>I pledge myself unreservedly to that goal. I say to you in words that cannot
                        be improved upon: “Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear
                        to negotiate.”</p>

                    <p>QUESTION: Could you give us your comments on, and reaction to, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s resignation? (Donovan)</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY: No matter what one thinks of the issue, this was a tragedy also in
                        human terms. One can well imagine how a man who was one day the single most
                        powerful man in the world and cast into utter oblivion the next must feel.
                        It was not until Wednesday night, August 7, that the resignation was 98%
                            certain.<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">For <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s recollections of August 7–9, from the day of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s decision through his
                            departure from the White House, see <hi rend="italic">Years of
                                Upheaval,</hi> pp. 1206–1214.</note> I did not speak to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> about the subject of
                        resignation until Tuesday, August 6, and that was in terms of the continuity
                        of the respect for the American people. On Monday, August 5, those close to
                        the President such as <persName corresp="#p_ZR_1">Ron Ziegler</persName> did
                        not seem to understand the significance of the tapes about to be released.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZR_1">Ziegler</persName>, for example, thought
                        they might cause a little furor which would soon die down. During the past
                        week I had no legal discussions on Watergate with the White House and did
                        not talk to <persName corresp="#p_SCJD_1">St. Clair</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">

                        My only discussions concerned the effect of Watergate on the national
                        interest. When the Supreme Court decision was rendered, I thought
                        resignation inevitable. I was told in May that the transcripts released last
                        week were exculpatory. The tapes revealed two Nixons, one that I knew and
                        one I didn’t know. Regarding his swearing, I never heard him use profane
                        language. Then, too, his sentence structures one reads from the tapes are
                        most peculiar and cer<pb n="221" facs="0252" xml:id="pg_221"/>tainly not
                        like the articulate <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> I dealt
                        with. For example, “Do this quickly, like in ten minutes” is not the type of
                        expression I would have expected from <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>QUESTION: What about <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s legal
                        future? (Sidey)</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY: I know <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> talked to
                            <persName corresp="#p_JL_1">Jaworski</persName>, but as far as I know
                        this conversation was basically to inform <persName corresp="#p_JL_1"
                            >Jaworski</persName> of the decision to resign. Without the tapes, the
                        Watergate affair would have ended without <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName>’s removal from office.</p>
                    <p>QUESTION: How did taping start in the White House? Was it <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHR_1">Haldeman</persName>’s idea? (Sidey)</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY: I did not know about the taping of the President’s conversations
                        when it started. In talking about taping, one must understand the peculiar
                        atmosphere in the White House. In 1962 <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> was joined by such political has-beens as <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHR_1">Haldeman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EJD_1"
                            >Ehrlichman</persName> and a few younger people such as <persName
                            corresp="#p_ZR_1">Ziegler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CDL_1"
                            >Chapin</persName> who were on the make. Intellectually they were
                        nothing more than advance men. Normally, advance men are put aside in a
                        policy sense, but this was not the case. These men kept others away from
                        getting into the White House. I was the only outsider who got in. Regarding
                        the taping, <persName corresp="#p_HHR_1">Haldeman</persName> wanted someone
                        at all meetings with the President to check on others. A man working in my
                        area was considered for this role but refused to take it on. Because of
                        this, taping was instituted, and the tapes were held by <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHR_1">Haldeman</persName>. This caused considerable trouble
                        as there was no way to get the tapes and if one did what the President said
                        during his ruminations, one could be in trouble.</p>
                    <p>QUESTION: Did <persName corresp="#p_HHR_1">Haldeman</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_EJD_1">Ehrlichman</persName> resent you prior to Watergate?
                        (Gart)</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY: Resentment came to light if something went wrong. For example, on
                        the India-Pakistan question, they did not exactly help me, to put it mildly.
                        My office was the only one which had people not approved by <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHR_1">Haldeman</persName>. I recruited my own staff. My
                        situation on entering the White House was simple—those in the White House
                        wanted to conduct civil war; those outside the White House with whom I was
                        emotionally associated turned on me because I joined the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Administration.</p>
                    <p>QUESTION: What effect will transition have on our foreign policy?</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY: This has given us strength in foreign countries. The fact that the
                        new President steps in on Friday, sees some 45 or more Ambassadors and talks
                        with confidence is a source of strength. The Soviet Union has been shaken by
                        the change. <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> rushed back.
                        When I saw the President yesterday, I told him I thought <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> would come back soon. I returned
                        to my office to find a note saying he’s <pb n="222" facs="0253"
                            xml:id="pg_222"/>back. I returned to the President to tell him I will
                        always try to be a good prophet for him. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> had handled problems more subtly than
                        I would have thought two weeks ago. He was very deft in his talks with the
                        Ambassadors.</p>
                    <p>QUESTION: What is going to be the foreign policy strategy in the new
                        Administration?</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY: Our objective is to weave something of enormous complexity to give
                        us more options. President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> can
                        benefit from policies now coming to fruition. For example, our relations
                        with Japan have been on the upswing for a year. And our relations with
                        Europe are now very strong. The President can have an opportunity for
                        construction, not just crisis management, and he will be comfortable
                        here.</p>
                    <p>QUESTION: Regarding relations with the Soviet Union, will <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> be tougher? (Sidey)</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY: If one analyzes our policy, where has there been an absence of
                        toughness? The Soviets have been squeezed unmercifully in the Middle East.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> was not soft on the
                        Soviets. What should we ask the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>? On
                        emigration, Scoop <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> could not
                        solve this problem alone.</p>
                    <p>QUESTION: What about <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY: Regarding <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> issues, with all
                        due respect they are phony issues. Conservative intellectuals and Jewish
                        groups were turned off just because they couldn’t stomach <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>. We can now have a more rational
                        debate on the subject. We want to keep our defense budget where it is, and
                        therefore must develop rhetoric with this in mind. The <persName
                            corresp="#p_ZERJ_1">Zumwalt</persName> thesis of strategic superiority
                        has no foreign policy or strategic basis. On the question of a first strike,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> could get only 20% of our force,
                        and we could get 85% of their force. How could any responsible political
                        leader on either side say, “Look, boss, let’s shoot out our land-based
                        missiles.” He would be just plain crazy to do this, knowing the limitations
                        of accuracy and the fact that his adversary would still have the potential
                        to destroy him after a first strike. The only people planning any strategy
                        in the U.S. are the people at Rand. If you put <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                            >Schlesinger</persName> and me in a room, there would be some esoteric
                        differences only. The reason for no <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        agreement thus far is the bureaucratic difficulties here and in Moscow. The
                        chances for an agreement in 1975 have now greatly improved. I think
                        President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> agrees with my
                        thinking on this subject. When <persName corresp="#p_ZERJ_1"
                            >Zumwalt</persName> says the balance is tipping against us, what does he
                        mean? We now have a superiority of four to one with 7,000 missiles. But are
                        we more confident? These missiles are politically useless in a crisis. You
                        cannot move them; you cannot see them. By 1980 we will still have two-to-one
                        superiority. By 1984 we will conservatively have 17,000 missiles. But what
                        do you do with them? The Trident is coming along which will have ten
                        warheads on each <pb n="223" facs="0254" xml:id="pg_223"/>missile, and we
                        can base these on land if we want. What will <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1"
                            >Jackson</persName> do with strategic superiority? What will the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> do? I am confident this wrangling may
                        end now with the nastiness going out of the debate as the intellectuals
                        change back with Watergate out of the way. Our objective in <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> is to put a cap on deployment. <persName
                            corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> wants to reduce; we do not.</p>
                    <p>QUESTION: What are our real foreign policy tests? (Grunwald)</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY: I am confident we will do well with the Russians. Before it was a
                        combination of a lame-duck President and Watergate. The latter issue has
                        been removed. The chances for a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        Agreement in 1975 are excellent. The situation in the Middle East is
                        dangerous and we must pursue our efforts in the area. One of the greatest
                        concerns in the weak government in Israel. I may go to China and Japan in
                        the first half of September, and to Moscow and India in the second half of
                        October.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald Ford</persName> addressed the
                        annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Chicago on August 19,
                        1974. The President focused his introductory remarks upon his offer of
                        earned reentry to Americans who had evaded the draft during the Vietnam war.
                        He then stressed: “The United States, our allies, and our friends around the
                        world must maintain strength and resolve. Potential adversaries obviously
                        watch the state of our readiness and the strength of our will. I will offer
                        them no temptations. America is not the policeman of the world, but we will
                        continue to be the backbone of a free world collective security setup. Just
                        as America will maintain its nuclear deterrent strength, we will never fall
                        behind in negotiations to control—and hopefully reduce—this threat to
                        mankind. A great nation is not only strong but wise, not only principled but
                        purposeful. A fundamental purpose of our Nation must be to achieve peace
                        through strength and meaningful negotiations.” (<hi rend="italic">Public

                        echoed the President’s comments while addressing the American Legion

                            >Kissinger</persName> commented:</p>
                    <p>“So our search for peace begins with America’s strength. For other nations to
                        have confidence in our purposes and faith in our word, America must remain a
                        military power second to none. As I can attest from experience, in time of
                        crisis and at the conference table, America’s <pb n="224" facs="0255"
                            xml:id="pg_224"/>military might is the foundation of our diplomatic
                        strength. We have made progress toward peace in recent years because we have
                        been flexible, but also because we have been resolute. Let us never forget
                        that conciliation is a virtue only in those who are thought to have a
                        choice.</p>
                    <p>“—A strong defense is the essential deterrent to aggression. By demonstrating
                        that there is no alternative to negotiation, it is the precondition of our
                        policy of relaxing tensions with our adversaries.</p>
                    <p>“—A strong defense is the cement of our alliances, reinforcing our partners’
                        will to join in the common defense. It is the basis of mutual confidence and
                        thus of our cooperation across the whole spectrum of our common interests.”

                            Assembly. Drought and famine characterized the global food situation
                            during 1973–1974, thus increasing the need for American agricultural
                            commodities and prompting the United States to reevaluate its food aid
                            commitments. In response to a question posed at his September 16 news
                            conference regarding the American response to global starvation,
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> asserted that a “very

                            be conducted on the basis of confrontation. So each nation must ask what
                            it can do, what contribution it is finally prepared to make to the

                    <p>As a party leader in the Congress of the United States, as Vice President,
                        and now as President of the United States of America, I have had the closest
                        working relationship with Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>. I have supported and will continue to endorse his
                        many efforts as Secretary of State and in our National Security Council
                        system to build a world of peace.</p>
                    <p>Since the United Nations was founded, the world has experienced conflicts and
                        threats to peace. But we have avoided the greatest danger: another world
                        war. Today we have the opportunity to make the remainder of this century an
                        era of peace and cooperation and economic well-being.</p>
                    <p>The harsh hostilities which once held great powers in their rigid grasp have
                        now begun to moderate. Many of the crises which dominated past General
                        Assemblies are fortunately behind us. Technological progress holds out the
                        hope that one day all men can achieve a decent life.</p>
                    <p>Nations too often have had no choice but to be either hammer or anvil—to
                        strike or to be struck. Now we have a new opportunity—to forge, in concert
                        with others, a framework of international cooperation. That is the course
                        the United States has chosen for itself.</p>
                    <p>On behalf of the American people, I renew these basic pledges to you
                        today:</p>
                    <p>—We are committed to a pursuit of a more peaceful, stable, and cooperative
                        world. While we are determined never to be bested in a test of strength, we
                        will devote our strength to what is best. And in the nuclear era, there is
                        no rational alternative to accords of mutual restraint between the United
                        States and the Soviet Union, two nations which have the power to destroy
                        mankind.</p>
                    <p>—We will bolster our partnerships with traditional friends in Europe, Asia,
                        and Latin America to meet new challenges in a rapidly <pb n="226"
                            facs="0257" xml:id="pg_226"/>changing world. The maintenance of such
                        relationships underpins rather than undercuts the search for peace.</p>
                    <p>—We will seek out, we will expand our relations with old adversaries. For
                        example, our new rapport with the People’s Republic of China best serves the
                        purposes of each nation and the interests of the entire world.</p>
                    <p>—We will strive to heal old wounds reopened in recent conflicts in Cyprus,
                        the Middle East, and in Indochina. Peace cannot be imposed from without, but
                        we will do whatever is within our capacity to help achieve it.</p>
                    <p>—We rededicate ourselves to the search for justice, equality, and freedom.
                        Recent developments in Africa signal the welcome end of colonialism.
                        Behavior appropriate to an era of dependence must give way to the new
                        responsibilities of an era of interdependence.</p>
                    <p>No single nation, no single group of nations, no single organization, can
                        meet all of the challenges before the community of nations. We must act in
                        concert. Progress toward a better world must come through cooperative
                        efforts across the whole range of bilateral and multilateral relations.</p>
                    <p>America’s revolutionary birth and centuries of experience in adjusting
                        democratic government to changing conditions have made Americans practical
                        as well as idealistic. As idealists, we are proud of our role in the
                        founding of the United Nations and in supporting its many accomplishments.
                        As practical people, we are sometimes impatient at what we see as
                        shortcomings.</p>
                    <p>In my 25 years as a member of the Congress of the United States, I learned
                        two basic practical lessons:</p>
                    <p>—First, men of differing political persuasions can find common ground for
                        cooperation. We need not agree on all issues in order to agree on most.
                        Differences of principle, of purpose, of perspective, will not disappear.
                        But neither will our mutual problems disappear unless we are determined to
                        find mutually helpful solutions.</p>
                    <p>—Second, a majority must take into account the proper interest of a minority
                        if the decisions of the majority are to be accepted. We who believe in and
                        live by majority rule must always be alert to the danger of the “tyranny of
                        the majority.” Majority rule thrives on the habits of accommodation,
                        moderation, and consideration of the interests of others.</p>
                    <p>A very stark reality has tempered America’s actions for decades—and must now
                        temper the actions of all nations. Prevention of full-scale warfare in the
                        nuclear age has become everybody’s responsibility. Today’s regional conflict
                        must not become tomorrow’s world disaster. <pb n="227" facs="0258"
                            xml:id="pg_227"/>We must assure by every means at our disposal that
                        local crises are quickly contained and resolved.</p>
                    <p>The challenge before the United States [Nations] is very clear. This
                        organization can place the weight of the world community on the side of
                        world peace. And this organization can provide impartial forces to maintain
                        the peace.</p>
                    <p>And at this point, I wish to pay tribute on behalf of the American people to
                        the 37 members of the U.N. peacekeeping forces who have given their lives in
                        the Middle East and in Cyprus in the past 10 months, and I convey our
                        deepest sympathies to their loved ones.</p>
                    <p>Let the quality of our response measure up to the magnitude of the challenge
                        that we face. I pledge to you that America will continue to be constructive,
                        innovative, and responsive to the work of this great body.</p>
                    <p>The nations in this hall are united by a deep concern for peace. We are
                        united as well by our desire to insure a better life for all people.</p>
                    <p>Today the economy of the world is under unprecedented stress. We need new
                        approaches to international cooperation to respond effectively to the
                        problems that we face. Developing and developed countries, market and
                        nonmarket countries—we are all a part of one interdependent economic
                        system.</p>
                    <p>The food and oil crises demonstrate the extent of our interdependence. Many
                        developing nations need the food surplus of a few developed nations. And
                        many industrialized nations need the oil production of a few developing
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>Energy is required to produce food, and food to produce energy—and both to
                        provide a decent life for everyone. The problems of food and energy can be
                        resolved on the basis of cooperation—or can, I should say, [be] made
                        unmanageable on the basis of confrontation. Runaway inflation, propelled by
                        food and oil price increases, is an early warning signal to all of us.</p>
                    <p>Let us not delude ourselves. Failure to cooperate on oil and food and
                        inflation could spell disaster for every nation represented in this
                            room.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4">During a September 17 White House
                            meeting devoted to the food crisis, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> noted: “The President is scolding everyone at
                            the United Nations for being miserly on energy, and the less we say
                            we’ll do on food, the less effect it has. We are trying to tell the
                            Third World they must be cooperative, and in turn we will try to
                            cooperate.” For the full memorandum of conversation, see <ref

                                Foreign Economic Policy, 1973–1976, Document 266</ref>.</note> The
                        United Nations must not and need not allow this to occur. A global strategy
                        for food and energy is urgently required.</p>
                    <p>The United States believes four principles should guide a global
                        approach:</p>
                    <pb n="228" facs="0259" xml:id="pg_228"/>
                    <p>—First, all nations must substantially increase production. Just to maintain
                        the present standards of living the world must almost double its output of
                        food and energy to match the expected increase in the world’s population by
                        the end of this century. To meet aspirations for a better life, production
                        will have to expand at a significantly faster rate than population
                        growth.</p>
                    <p>—Second, all nations must seek to achieve a level of prices which not only
                        provides an incentive to producers but which consumers can afford. It should
                        now be clear that the developed nations are not the only countries which
                        demand and receive an adequate return for their goods. But it should also be
                        clear that by confronting consumers with production restrictions, artificial
                        pricing, and the prospect of ultimate bankruptcy, producers will eventually
                        become the victims of their own actions.</p>
                    <p>—Third, all nations must avoid the abuse of man’s fundamental needs for the
                        sake of narrow national or bloc advantage. The attempt by any nation to use
                        one commodity for political purposes will inevitably tempt other countries
                        to use their commodities for their own purposes.</p>
                    <p>—Fourth, the nations of the world must assure that the poorest among us are
                        not overwhelmed by rising prices of the imports necessary for their
                        survival. The traditional aid donors and the increasingly wealthy oil
                        producers must join in this effort.</p>
                    <p>The United States recognizes the special responsibility we bear as the
                        world’s largest producer of food. That is why Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> proposed from this very podium
                        last year a World Food Conference to define a global food policy.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d44fn5">See <ref target="#d17">Documents 17</ref> and <ref
                                target="#d47">47</ref>.</note> And that is one reason why we have
                        removed domestic restrictions on food productions in the United States. It
                        has not been our policy to use food as a political weapon, despite the oil
                        embargo and recent oil price and production decisions.</p>
                    <p>It would be tempting for the United States—beset by inflation and soaring
                        energy prices—to turn a deaf ear to external appeals for food assistance or
                        to respond with internal appeals for export controls. But however difficult
                        our own economic situation, we recognize that the plight of others is
                        worse.</p>
                    <p>Americans have always responded to human emergencies in the past. And we
                        respond again here today.</p>
                    <p>In response to Secretary General [of the United Nations Kurt] <persName
                            corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName>’s appeal and to help meet the
                        long-term challenge in food, I reiterate:</p>
                    <pb n="229" facs="0260" xml:id="pg_229"/>
                    <p>—To help developing nations realize their aspirations to grow more of their
                        own food, the United States will substantially increase its assistance to
                        agricultural production programs in other countries.</p>
                    <p>—Next, to insure that the survival of millions of our fellow men does not
                        depend upon the vagaries of weather, the United States is prepared to join
                        in a worldwide effort to negotiate, establish, and maintain an international
                        system of food reserves. This system will work best if each nation is made
                        responsible for managing the reserves that it will have available.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, to make certain that the more immediate needs for food are met this
                        year, the United States will not only maintain the amount it spends for food
                        shipments to nations in need, but it will increase this amount this
                        year.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the United States is striving to help define and help contribute to a
                        cooperative global policy to meet man’s immediate and long-term need for
                        food. We will set forth our comprehensive proposals at the World Food
                        Conference in November.</p>
                    <p>Now is the time for oil producers to define their conception of a global
                        policy on energy to meet the growing need—and to do this without imposing
                        unacceptable burdens on the international monetary and trade system.</p>
                    <p>A world of economic confrontation cannot be a world of political cooperation.
                        If we fail to satisfy man’s fundamental needs for energy and food, we face a
                        threat not just to our aspirations for a better life for all our peoples but
                        to our hopes for a more stable and a more peaceful world. By working
                        together to overcome our common problems, mankind can turn from fear toward
                        hope.</p>
                    <p>From the time of the founding of the United Nations, America volunteered to
                        help nations in need, frequently as the main benefactor. We were able to do
                        it. We were glad to do it. But as new economic forces alter and reshape
                        today’s complex world, no nation can be expected to feed all the world’s
                        hungry peoples. Fortunately, however, many nations are increasingly able to
                        help. And I call on them to join with us as truly united nations in the
                        struggle to provide more food at lower prices for the hungry and, in
                        general, a better life for the needy of this world.</p>
                    <p>America will continue to do more than its share. But there are realistic
                        limits to our capacities. There is no limit, however, to our determination
                        to act in concert with other nations to fulfill the vision of the United
                        Nations Charter: to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and
                        to promote social progress and better standards, better standards of life in
                        a larger freedom.</p>

                        the Imperative of Cooperation</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Challenge</p>
                    <p>Since the dawn of the nuclear age the world’s fears of holocaust and its
                        hopes for peace have turned on the relationship between the United States
                        and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Throughout history men have sought peace but suffered war; all too often,
                        deliberate decisions or miscalculations have brought violence and
                        destruction to a world yearning for tranquility. Tragic as the consequences
                        of violence may have been in the past, the issue of peace and war takes on
                        unprecedented urgency when, for the first time in history, two nations have
                        the capacity to destroy mankind. In the nuclear age, as President <persName
                            corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName> pointed out two decades ago,
                        “there is no longer any alternative to peace.”</p>
                    <p>The destructiveness of modern weapons defines the necessity of the task; deep
                        differences in philosophy and interests between the United States and the
                        Soviet Union point up its difficulty. These differences do not spring from
                        misunderstanding or personalities or transitory factors:</p>
                    <p>—They are rooted in history and in the way the two countries have
                        developed.</p>
                    <p>—They are nourished by conflicting values and opposing ideologies.</p>
                    <p>—They are expressed in diverging national interests that produce political
                        and military competition.</p>
                    <p>—They are influenced by allies and friends whose association we value and
                        whose interests we will not sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>Paradox confuses our perception of the problem of peaceful coexistence: if
                        peace is pursued to the exclusion of any other goal, other values will be
                        compromised and perhaps lost; but if unconstrained rivalry leads to nuclear
                        conflict, these values, along with everything else, will be destroyed in the
                        resulting holocaust. However competitive they <pb n="231" facs="0262"
                            xml:id="pg_231"/>may be at some levels of their relationship, both major
                        nuclear powers must base their policies on the premise that neither can
                        expect to impose its will on the other without running an intolerable risk.
                        The challenge of our time is to reconcile the reality of competition with
                        the imperative of coexistence.</p>
                    <p>There can be no peaceful international order without a constructive
                        relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. There will be
                        no international stability unless both the Soviet Union and the United
                        States conduct themselves with restraint and unless they use their enormous
                        power for the benefit of mankind.</p>
                    <p>Thus we must be clear at the outset on what the term “détente” entails. It is
                        the search for a more constructive relationship with the Soviet Union
                        reflecting the realities I have outlined. It is a continuing process, not a
                        final condition that has been or can be realized at any one specific point
                        in time. And it has been pursued by successive American leaders, though the
                        means have varied as have world conditions.</p>
                    <p>Some fundamental principles guide this policy:</p>
                    <p>The United States cannot base its policy solely on Moscow’s good intentions.
                        But neither can we insist that all forward movement must await a convergence
                        of American and Soviet purposes. We seek, regardless of Soviet intentions,
                        to serve peace through a systematic resistance to pressure and conciliatory
                        responses to moderate behavior.</p>
                    <p>We must oppose aggressive actions and irresponsible behavior. But we must not
                        seek confrontations lightly.</p>
                    <p>We must maintain a strong national defense while recognizing that in the
                        nuclear age the relationship between military strength and politically
                        usable power is the most complex in all history.</p>
                    <p>Where the age-old antagonism between freedom and tyranny is concerned, we are
                        not neutral. But other imperatives impose limits on our ability to produce
                        internal changes in foreign countries. Consciousness of our limits is
                        recognition of the necessity of peace—not moral callousness. The
                        preservation of human life and human society are moral values, too.</p>
                    <p>We must be mature enough to recognize that to be stable a relationship must
                        provide advantages to both sides and that the most constructive
                        international relationships are those in which both parties perceive an
                        element of gain. Moscow will benefit from certain measures, just as we will
                        from others. The balance cannot be struck on each issue every day, but only
                        over the whole range of relations and over a period of time.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are a historical overview of détente and information concerning
                        specific agreements negotiated between the United States and the Soviet
                        Union.]</p>
                    <pb n="232" facs="0263" xml:id="pg_232"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Agenda for the Future</p>
                    <p>Détente is a process, not a permanent achievement. The agenda is full and
                        continuing. Obviously the main concern must be to reduce the sources of
                        potential conflict. This requires efforts in several interrelated areas:</p>
                    <p>—The military competition in all its aspects must be subject to increasingly
                        firm restraints by both sides.</p>
                    <p>—Political competition, especially in moments of crisis, must be guided by
                        the principles of restraint set forth in the documents described earlier.
                        Crises there will be, but the United States and the Soviet Union have a
                        special obligation deriving from the unimaginable military power that they
                        wield and represent. Exploitation of crisis situations for unilateral gain
                        is not acceptable.</p>
                    <p>—Restraint in crises must be augmented by cooperation in removing the causes
                        of crises. There have been too many instances, notably in the Middle East,
                        which demonstrate that policies of unilateral advantage sooner or later run
                        out of control and lead to the brink of war, if not beyond.</p>
                    <p>—The process of negotiations and consultation must be continuous and intense.
                        But no agreement between the nuclear superpowers can be durable if made over
                        the heads of other nations which have a stake in the outcome. We should not
                        seek to impose peace; we can, however, see that our own actions and conduct
                        are conducive to peace.</p>
                    <p>In the coming months we shall strive:</p>
                    <p>—To complete the negotiations for comprehensive and equitable limitations on
                        strategic arms until at least 1985;</p>
                    <p>—To complete the multilateral negotiations on mutual force reductions in
                        Central Europe, so that security will be enhanced for all the countries of
                        Europe;</p>
                    <p>—To conclude the conference on European security and cooperation in a manner
                        that promotes both security and human aspirations;</p>
                    <p>—To continue the efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons to additional
                        countries without depriving those countries of the peaceful benefits of
                        atomic energy;</p>
                    <p>—To complete ratification of the recently negotiated treaty banning
                        underground nuclear testing by the United States and U.S.S.R. above a
                        certain threshold;</p>
                    <p>—To begin negotiations on the recently agreed effort to overcome the possible
                        dangers of environmental modification techniques for military purposes;
                        and</p>
                    <p>—To resolve the longstanding attempts to cope with the dangers of chemical
                        weaponry.</p>
                    <pb n="233" facs="0264" xml:id="pg_233"/>
                    <p>We must never forget that the process of détente depends ultimately on habits
                        and modes of conduct that extend beyond the letter of agreements to the
                        spirit of relations as a whole. This is why the whole process must be
                        carefully nurtured.</p>
                    <p>In cataloging the desirable, we must take care not to jeopardize what is
                        attainable. We must consider what alternative policies are available and
                        what their consequences would be. And the implications of alternatives must
                        be examined not just in terms of a single issue but for how they might
                        affect the entire range of Soviet-American relations and the prospects for
                        world peace.</p>
                    <p>We must assess not only individual challenges to détente but also their
                        cumulative impact:</p>
                    <p>If we justify each agreement with Moscow only when we can show unilateral
                        gain,</p>
                    <p>If we strive for an elusive strategic “superiority,”</p>
                    <p>If we systematically block benefits to the Soviet Union,</p>
                    <p>If we try to transform the Soviet system by pressure,</p>
                    <p>If in short, we look for final results before we agree to any results, then
                        we would be reviving the doctrines of liberation and massive retaliation of
                        the 1950’s. And we would do so at a time when Soviet physical power and
                        influence on the world are greater than a quarter century ago when those
                        policies were devised and failed. The futility of such a course is as
                        certain as its danger.</p>
                    <p>Let there be no question, however, that Soviet actions could destroy détente
                        as well:</p>
                    <p>If the Soviet Union uses détente to strengthen its military capacity in all
                        fields,</p>
                    <p>If in crises it acts to sharpen tension,</p>
                    <p>If it does not contribute to progress toward stability,</p>
                    <p>If it seeks to undermine our alliances,</p>
                    <p>If it is deaf to the urgent needs of the least developed and the emerging
                        issues of interdependence, then it in turn tempts a return to the tensions
                        and conflicts we have made such efforts to overcome. The policy of
                        confrontation has worked for neither of the superpowers.</p>
                    <p>We have insisted toward the Soviet Union that we cannot have the atmosphere
                        of détente without the substance. It is equally clear that the substance of
                        détente will disappear in an atmosphere of hostility.</p>
                    <p>We have profound differences with the Soviet Union—in our values, our
                        methods, our vision of the future. But it is these very differences which
                        compel any responsible administration to make a major effort to create a
                        more constructive relationship.</p>
                    <pb n="234" facs="0265" xml:id="pg_234"/>
                    <p>We face an opportunity that was not possible 25 years, or even a decade, ago.
                        If that opportunity is lost, its moment will not quickly come again. Indeed,
                        it may not come at all.</p>
                    <p>As President Kennedy pointed out: “For in the final analysis our most basic
                        common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the
                        same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.”<note

                    <p>MR. RESTON: You have been sounding rather pessimistic in the last few weeks.
                        Are you worried about the state of the West?</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER: I don’t mean to sound pessimistic. I think that there
                        are huge problems before us, and I’m trying to define them. I believe that
                        the problems are soluble, but they require a major effort and, in some
                        areas, new approaches, but I’m not pessimistic about the ability to solve
                        them. We have—</p>
                    <p>Q Could I interrupt there to say that in reading what you have written in the
                        past, I have a sense of pessimism in your writings, even of tragedy. Do you
                        regard your thought as being essentially tragic, when you look at the last
                        two generations?</p>
                    <p>A I think of myself as a historian more than as a statesman. As a historian,
                        you have to be conscious of the fact that every civilization that has ever
                        existed has ultimately collapsed.</p>
                    <p>History is a tale of efforts that failed, of aspirations that weren’t
                        realized, of wishes that were fulfilled and then turned out to be different
                            <pb n="235" facs="0266" xml:id="pg_235"/>from what one expected. So, as
                        a historian, one has to live with a sense of the inevitability of tragedy.
                        As a statesman, one has to act on the assumption that problems must be
                        solved.</p>
                    <p>Each generation lives in time, and even though ultimately perhaps societies
                        have all suffered a decline, that is of no help to any one generation, and
                        the decline is usually traceable to a loss of creativity and inspiration and
                        therefore avoidable.</p>
                    <p>It is probably true that insofar as I think historically I must look at the
                        tragedies that have occurred. Insofar as I act, my motive force, of which I
                        am conscious, it is to try to avoid them.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Issue of Feasibility</p>
                    <p>Q Don’t we have to bring this problem down to practical points, the
                        difference between the ideals of a republic and what can be done? Is there a
                        conflict now in America between the ideals of foreign policy that you see
                        for the order of the world and what can actually be done in terms of public
                        understanding and in actual votes in the Congress of the United States?</p>
                    <p>A I think almost every nation right now has the problem of reconciling its
                        domestic view of itself with the international problem because every nation
                        has to live on so many levels.</p>
                    <p>Certainly in every non-Communist nation—and probably even in Communist
                        nations—public opinion in one way or another is becoming more and more
                        important. But what public opinion is conscious of are the day-to-day
                        problems of life. The remoter issues, geographically and in time, do not
                        impinge on the average citizen.</p>
                    <p>In foreign policy, the most difficult issues are those whose necessity you
                        cannot prove when the decisions are made. You act on the basis of an
                        assessment that in the nature of things is a guess, so that public opinion
                        knows, usually, only when it is too late to act, when some catastrophe has
                        become overwhelming.</p>
                    <p>The necessity of the measures one takes to avoid the catastrophe can almost
                        never be proved. For that reason you require a great deal, or at least a
                        certain amount of confidence in leadership and that becomes difficult in all
                        societies.</p>
                    <p>But, speaking of the United States, if one looks at the crisis through which
                        America has gone over the last decade—the assassinations, the Vietnam war,
                        Watergate—it is very difficult to establish the relationship of
                        confidence.</p>
                    <p>Then the United States also has particular problems in terms of its
                        historical experience. We never had to face the problem of security until
                        the end of the Second World War, so we could afford to be very idealistic
                        and insist on the pure implementation of our maxims.</p>
                    <pb n="236" facs="0267" xml:id="pg_236"/>
                    <p>To the average countries that were less favored, the problems of foreign
                        policy have usually appeared in a much more complicated form; that is, their
                        morality could not be expressed in absolute terms. Their morality had to
                        give the sense of inward security necessary to act step by step in less than
                        perfect modes.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Rebellion in U.S. Sensed</p>
                    <p>We are now in a similar position and therefore there is an almost instinctive
                        rebellion in America against the pragmatic aspect of foreign policy that is
                        security-oriented, that achieves finite objectives, that seeks to settle for
                        the best attainable, rather than for the best. In this sense, we are having
                        domestic problems.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, there is a strain in America which is curiously, extremely
                        relevant to this world. We are challenged by the huge problems, peace and
                        war, energy, food, and we have a real belief in interdependence—it is not
                        just a slogan.</p>
                    <p>The solution of these problems really comes quite naturally to Americans,
                        first, because they believe that every problem is soluble; secondly, because
                        they are at ease with redoing the world, and the old frontier mentality
                        really does find an expression, and even the old idealism finds a way to
                        express itself.</p>
                    <p>In what other country could a leader say, “We are going to solve energy;
                        we’re going to solve food; we’re going to solve the problem of nuclear war,”
                        and be taken seriously? So I think it is true that there are strains in our
                        domestic debate; I think it is also true that there are many positive
                        aspects in our domestic debate that can help us reach these larger
                        goals.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of Western Europe.]</p>
                    <p>Q When you came to Washington in the first place after your study of history,
                        it was said that you had a concept of how to achieve the order of the world,
                        and yet in the last years, since you have been here, the tendency has been
                        to say that you have not defined your concept, but that actually what you
                        have been doing is negotiating pragmatic problems and not really dealing
                        with the concept or making clear the concept. What is that concept? First of
                        all, is the criticism correct, and second, what is the concept that you
                        see?</p>
                    <p>A Well, I think you will find few officials who will tell you that any
                        criticism you can make of them is correct, but I don’t think the criticism
                        is quite correct. I do not have the choice, in any position, between
                        imposing a theoretical order or negotiating, because if you don’t solve
                        immediate problems, you can never solve long-term problems.</p>
                    <p>If you act creatively you should be able to use crises to move the world
                        towards the structural solutions that are necessary. In fact, very <pb
                            n="237" facs="0268" xml:id="pg_237"/>often the crises themselves are a
                        symptom of the need for a structural rearrangement.</p>
                    <p>I faced a number of problems partly of perception and partly of structure. I
                        feel it is essential that when the United States acts in foreign policy,
                        that it understands first what the American national interest is in relation
                        to the problem. And, to define that, America has to know what the world
                        interest is, not only in relation to the specific problem, but in relation
                        to the historical evolution from which any solution of a problem starts.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">No Response From Europe</p>
                    <p>So I have tried—historians will have to judge with what success—to understand
                        the forces that are at work in this period. My associates will confirm that
                        when we tackle a problem, we spend the greatest part of our time at the
                        beginning trying to relate it to where America and the world ought to go
                        before we ever discuss tactics.</p>
                    <p>I think somebody would have to go through my speeches and press conferences
                        to see to what extent I have articulated general propositions. I don’t think
                        I should be the judge of this here.</p>
                    <p>Q When you made your speech at the Waldorf,<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">
                            <ref target="#d8">Document 8</ref>.</note> I regarded it at that time as
                        something equivalent almost to the offer of the Marshall Plan. Yet we got no
                        real response from Europe. Even when you went to London and talked about
                            interdependence,<note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s Pilgrims speech in
                            London, Document 24.</note> there was no response. Now, something was
                        wrong there. Could you define it?</p>
                    <p>A There are always at least two aspects to any problem. One is your
                        definition of the problem. Second, how you solve it. Are you doing it
                        correctly?</p>
                    <p>I believe that the issues that I’ve attempted to define are serious issues.
                        Take my Waldorf speech, the so-called Year of Europe speech. It came at a
                        period when we had opened to China and opened to the Soviet Union and when
                        we had ended the Vietnam war.</p>
                    <p>Until we had accomplished at least some of those objectives, I did not see
                        how a creative period of relationship with Europe would be possible, because
                        the disagreement with our Vietnam policy in Europe was too deep. The fear of
                        nuclear confrontation was too great, as was the fear that the United States
                        was somehow to blame for this state of hostility in the world.</p>
                    <p>So, in early 1973, I thought the time was opportune to move towards a serious
                        dialogue with Europe, and I thought it was all the more essential because I
                        did not want success to become identified in <pb n="238" facs="0269"
                            xml:id="pg_238"/>the public consciousness only with relations with
                        adversaries, and I felt that the old Atlantic relationship would over a
                        period of time become so much taken for granted and so much the province of
                        an older generation that the next generation would consider it as something
                        not relevant to itself.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Debate Over Consultation</p>
                    <p>I think that this perception was essentially correct. Why did it lead to this
                        intense dialogue? One reason is that, at that particular moment, Europe was
                        enormously absorbed with itself. Every European country, it soon became
                        apparent, had a leadership crisis of its own and was trying to sort out its
                        own domestic problems. Beyond that, Europe was very much occupied in forming
                        its own identity, and it had so much difficulty in doing so that any greater
                        conception seemed a threat to whatever autonomy they had so painfully
                        wrested from their deliberations.</p>
                    <p>So we became involved in an abstruse theoretical debate over the nature of
                        consultation, something that could never be written down because you can’t
                        wave a paper at somebody and tell him he’s obliged to consult if he doesn’t
                        want to consult.</p>
                    <p>Then the Middle East war occurred, and that had a tendency to emphasize
                        national frustrations, so that the larger dialogue that I had sought took a
                        long time to get started, but finally the end result was pretty close to
                        what we had asked—though not completely in the spirit I had hoped to evoke.
                        We got the documents we wanted, but we didn’t get the spirit of creativity
                        that, for example, the Marshall offer evoked.</p>
                    <p>Now, similarly, with the Pilgrim speech in London. It was not received very
                        warmly because, again, it was looked at very much from the national point of
                        view. Nevertheless, events have moved us inevitably in that direction. The
                        emergency sharing program which seemed revolutionary in February, has now
                        been accepted by all the countries. Even France, I hope, will find some way
                        of relating itself to it.</p>
                    <p>And we are now engaged in discussions which will go far beyond what we could
                        talk about last year. In the late nineteen forties the mere fact that the
                        United States was willing to commit itself was a tremendous event. Now, this
                        is probably not enough, and our aspirations have to be expressed in action
                        rather than in debate.</p>
                    <p>Q On that point, when you offer, as a basis for discussion with the Europeans
                        and the rest of the world, a sharing of oil in a crisis, do you believe that
                        the spirit of this country will accept it? When you come down to a question
                        of producing oil for other countries who are in worse shape than we are, is
                        it politically possible in this country to do it?</p>
                    <pb n="239" facs="0270" xml:id="pg_239"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Disillusionment</p>
                    <p>A There is undoubtedly a profound disillusionment in America with foreign
                        involvement in general. We have carried the burden for a generation. In
                        fact, if you go back to the beginning of World War II, it doesn’t seem to
                        end. Most programs have been sold to Americans with the argument that they
                        would mean an end of exertion. Now we have to convince Americans that there
                        will never be an end to exertion. That’s a very difficult problem.</p>
                    <p>And if you look at some of our recent debates you would have to say we could
                        fail. I don’t think that those in key positions at this particular moment
                        have any real choice. At a minimum, we have to tell the American people what
                        we think is needed. If they do not agree, at least they will know 10 years
                        from now, if there is a catastrophe, what happened. And then there is a
                        chance of restoring a sense of direction. But if 10 years from now there is
                        a catastrophe and people say, “Why didn’t somebody tell us about this and
                        why didn’t they ask us to do what they should have foreseen?”, then I think
                        our whole system may be in difficulty.</p>
                    <p>Q That’s a critical point because I don’t think the country—if one may
                        presume to think about what the country thinks—has the vaguest idea of what
                        it is called upon to do. We are complaining about how the oil-producing
                        nations are using their resources, and yet we have larger reserves of food
                        in North America than the nations of the Middle East have oil resources, and
                        yet here we are now arguing our national interests. We are against high
                        prices for oil, but we are still a very gluttonous wasteful country. Can
                        that be made clear?</p>
                    <p>A I think it is fair to say that we ourselves—I say “we,” those who have
                        positions of responsibility at this moment—we ourselves are learning the
                        magnitude of the challenges as we go along. In 1969, when I came to
                        Washington, I remember a study on the energy problem which proceeded from
                        the assumption that there would always be an energy surplus. It wasn’t
                        conceivable that there would be a shortage of energy.</p>
                    <p>Until 1972, we thought we had inexhaustible food surpluses, and the fact that
                        we have to shape our policy deliberately to relate ourselves to the rest of
                        the world did not really arise until 1973, when we did call for a world food
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>But you are right. We have to tell the American people what they are called
                        upon to do. That is our biggest problem. It’s our biggest challenge right
                        now. And will they support it? I hope that they will. I am, in fact,
                        confident that they will.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">For the Country</p>
                    <p>Q Can you define what those questions are that should be put to the country?
                        What does the government want the responsible citizen to <pb n="240"
                            facs="0271" xml:id="pg_240"/>do? He hasn’t had much lead from you and
                        your colleagues and the Government as to what you wish him to do.</p>
                    <p>A I am not sure that I agree with whether he has received leadership from my
                        colleagues and me. I think it is also fair to say that the nature of our
                        debate for many years now has been so bitter that it’s hard to put forward a
                        conception that doesn’t immediately get ripped apart by an attack on
                        motives.</p>
                    <p>But leaving that aside, I think in foreign policy we need a national
                        understanding of what is needed, what is meant by peace, and an
                        understanding that we are living in a world in which peace cannot be imposed
                        on others, which means that sometimes the outcomes must be less than
                        perfect. I have been concerned about the détente debate because so often the
                        issue is put in terms of—did the Soviets benefit from a particular deal? Of
                        course, they must benefit, or they won’t feel a stake in maintaining the
                        resulting structure.</p>
                    <p>So, we have to know what we mean by peace. We have to know what we mean by
                        cooperation, and we have above all to understand these big issues which we
                        have been discussing, like energy and food, in which our actions will
                        crucially determine what happens in the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>And, of course, what happens in the rest of the world will play back to us,
                        so we cannot afford an isolated approach. If we try a solo effort in energy
                        and, as a result, Italy collapses or Britain has a crisis, that is going to
                        bring about so many political transformations that, within a very brief
                        period of time, we would be affected in ways that even the average citizen
                        would feel very acutely.</p>
                    <p>On food, the same is true in reverse. We there have an opportunity to
                        demonstrate that when we talk interdependence, we are not just talking an
                        American desire to exploit the resources of other nations. What we are
                        saying is for our own benefit, of course. But it is also for the benefit of
                        everybody else. Now, that requires many changes in our thinking. Of course,
                        senior officials are always so busy with the day-to-day problems that they
                        always seem to think one can wait for a day or a week to articulate the
                        bigger issues.</p>
                    <p>It is also true that our people have been so preoccupied with domestic
                        problems that it is not so easy to get attention for the longer term.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vision of the World</p>
                    <p>Q If we do not see this problem of interdependence, what’s the vision that
                        you have of the world? What will happen to Western Civilization?</p>
                    <p>A If we do not get a recognition of our interdependence, the Western
                        civilization that we now have is almost certain to disintegrate <pb n="241"
                            facs="0272" xml:id="pg_241"/>because it will first lead to a series of
                        rivalries in which each region will try to maximize its own special
                        advantages. That inevitably will lead to tests of strength of one sort or
                        another. These will magnify domestic crises in many countries, and they will
                        then move more and more to authoritarian models.</p>
                    <p>I would expect then that we will certainly have crises which no leadership is
                        able to deal with, and probably military confrontations. But even if you
                        don’t have military confrontations, you will certainly, in my view, have
                        systemic crises similar to those of the twenties and thirties, but under
                        conditions when world consciousness has become global.</p>
                    <p>Q Well, now, that is your nightmare.</p>
                    <p>A That’s right.</p>
                    <p>Q What are your hopes? We are halfway between the end of the last world war,
                        a little more, and the end of the century. As an historian, and not as a
                        Secretary of State, looking back, if one can, from the end of the century to
                        this era, how can the nations find some way of living together or going
                        beyond the nation-state to something else?</p>
                    <p>A Looking toward the end of the century, I would hope that Western Europe,
                        Japan and the United States would have found a way of not just overcoming
                        the current economic crisis, but turning it into something positive by
                        understanding the responsibilities they share for each other’s progress and
                        for developing cooperative policies that are explicitly directed towards
                        world interests.</p>
                    <p>This requires a degree of financial solidarity, a degree of equalizing
                        burdens and a degree of ability to set common goals that cannot be done on a
                        purely national basis. This, incidentally, requires a united Europe because
                        with a plethora of nation-states in Europe we’ll never be able to do
                        this.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Must Halt Arms Race</p>
                    <p>In relation to the Soviet Union and Communist China, we should have achieved
                        a position, not of having overcome all our difficulties, but having reached
                        a point where the solution of these difficulties by war becomes less and
                        less conceivable and, over time, should have become inconceivable. This
                        means that there must be a visible and dramatic downturn in the arms race.
                        Otherwise, that race itself is going to generate so many fears that it can
                        be maintained only by a degree of public exhortation that is inconsistent
                        over a historic period with a policy of relaxation, and maybe even with
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>The underdeveloped nations—the now underdeveloped nations—should by then have
                        lost their sense of inferiority and should feel not that they have to
                        extort, but that they should participate. Thus, what I said earlier about
                        the relationship between Western Europe, the United <pb n="242" facs="0273"
                            xml:id="pg_242"/>States and Japan should have begun to be
                        institutionalized to embrace at least some of the key countries, and the
                        Soviet Union and China must be related to that.</p>
                    <p>Take the food problem. I do not believe that over an indefinite future, we
                        can solve the problem of world food reserves if the Soviet Union and
                        Communist China do not accept obligations of their own, or if they simply
                        rely on the rest of the world’s production to solve their problems on an
                        annual basis.</p>
                    <p>Q What should they be doing?</p>
                    <p>A Well, I think—and I will speak about that at the World Food Conference—we
                        have to develop over the next five to ten years some conceptions of the
                        reserves that should exist and the contribution that the major countries
                        should make. Countries that will not participate should not then ask
                        necessarily equal rights to participate in purchases of reserve stocks. But
                        this is something that requires further study.</p>
                    <p>Q Do you foresee in the next decade the possibility of political disarray in
                        Europe and of enormous human tragedy in other parts of the world?</p>
                    <p>A I think we are delicately poised right now. I genuinely think that the next
                        decade could either be a period that in retrospect will look like one of the
                        great periods of human creativity, or it could be the beginning of
                        extraordinary disarray.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Hope in Adversity</p>
                    <p>Q Is it possible—and it is obviously a Scottish Calvinist point of view that
                        the greatest hope of progress is adversity—that we are now really up against
                        economic, financial and social problems of such magnitude that we are
                        suddenly being forced, even by inflation, into a view of life that could be
                        more hopeful?</p>
                    <p>A While this period has more strain than, say, a decade ago, it has also
                        infinitely more opportunities, because we really have no choice except to
                        address our problems. Who would have thought of an international food policy
                        or a world food conference 10 years ago, or could have been taken seriously
                        if he had? Today, it is only a question of time until we develop it, and the
                        real question is, will we develop it soon enough? I think we can.</p>
                    <p>Q Is there a danger that if we do not deal with the world problems that here
                        at home we would become so frustrated that we would retreat, not into the
                        old-time isolationism, but into a kind of chauvinism that would make the
                        whole question of world order really quite impossible?</p>
                    <p>A It is a big problem. There is such a tendency in America, but at least part
                        of our chauvinism is disappointed idealism, so it’s always a question of
                        whether one can evoke the idealism.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Union vs. China</p>
                    <p>Q When I was in Europe just a few weeks ago, the question was raised there
                        about your concept of China and of the Soviet Union. The question was raised
                        whether in your mind you have not actually chosen one over the other, and in
                        the process were playing one up against the other. Could you clarify
                        that?</p>
                    <p>A When one analyzes foreign policy, there is always the temptation to look at
                        the day-to-day tactics and not at the underlying reality. Any attempt to
                        play off the Soviet Union and Communist China against each other would have
                        a high risk that, at least for tactical reasons, they would combine against
                        us. The rivalry and tensions between the Soviet Union and Communist China
                        were not created by the United States. In fact, we didn’t believe in their
                        reality for much too long a time. They cannot be exploited by the United
                        States. They can only be noted by the United States.</p>
                    <p>The correct policy for the United States is to take account of what exists
                        and to conduct a policy of meticulous honesty with both of them, so that
                        neither believes we are trying to use one against the other. In the course
                        of events, it may happen that one may feel that it is gaining benefit
                        against the other as a result of dealing with us, but that cannot be our aim
                        or purpose.</p>
                    <p>We have meticulously avoided forms of cooperation with the Soviet Union that
                        could be construed as directed against China. We have never signed
                        agreements whose chief purpose could be seen as directed against China, and
                        conversely we have never participated with China in declarations that could
                        be seen as aimed at the Soviet Union. We have developed our bilateral
                        relationships with both, and left them to sort out their relationships with
                        each other. In fact, we have rarely talked to either of them about the
                        other.</p>

                        Legacy</p>
                    <p>Q When you leave this office, what is it you want to have achieved at the end
                        of your service?</p>
                    <p>A It used to be that the overwhelming concern of any President or Secretary
                        of State had to be to make a contribution to peace in the traditional sense.
                        That is to say, to reduce tensions among nations or regions. That remains,
                        of course, an essential preoccupation. History has, I think, placed me in a
                        key position at a time when we are moving from the relics of the postwar
                        period toward a new international structure.</p>
                    <p>The Administration did not invent that structure. It did have, however, an
                        opportunity to contribute to it—an opportunity that did not <pb n="244"
                            facs="0275" xml:id="pg_244"/>exist 10 years earlier and that may not
                        exist 10 years later. Now, the difference between that structure and the
                        previous period is that there are more factors to consider and that it has
                        to be built not on the sense of the pre-eminence of two power centers, but
                        on the sense of participation of those who are part of the global
                        environment.</p>
                    <p>This has required a change in the American perception of the nature of
                        foreign policy. What is described as excessive pragmatism is really a rather
                        conscious attempt to try to educate myself, my generation, and my
                        associates, insofar as I can contribute to living with the world as it is
                        now emerging. Pragmatism unrelated to a purpose becomes totally
                        self-destructive.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I would like to leave at least the beginning of a perception of
                        a structure that goes beyond these centers of power, and moves towards a
                        global conception. There is no question in my mind that, by the end of the
                        century, this will be the dominant reality of our time. I believe we have to
                        move towards it now.</p>
                    <p>Q Can you define it?</p>
                    <p>A Before I go to that, let me say one other thing that I have been very much
                        concerned with. However long I stay, it will be but a temporary episode. To
                        succeed in these objectives, I will have to leave behind a public
                        understanding and, above all, an intellectual understanding in the State
                        Department that can carry on not only the detailed policies, but an overall
                        understanding of where America fits into the global scheme of things. I
                        intend to give increasing attention to this problem.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of the position of Secretary of State, the role
                        of Congress in decision-making, and intelligence organizations.]</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A View of America</p>
                    <p>Q I’m more interested in the rising generation than I am in the contemporary
                        problem, and for that reason I wanted to ask you this: A colleague of mine
                        went to see <persName corresp="#p_BW_1">Willy Brandt</persName> and asked,
                        “What does the young generation in Germany now think of America?” And
                            <persName corresp="#p_BW_1">Brandt</persName> replied, “The magic is
                        gone.” And when he was asked what he meant by that, it was that we have used
                        power, he thought, in a way that did not comport to our ideals, particularly
                        in Vietnam, but there was something beyond that, a kind of sense that we
                        were engaged in a kind of disintegration. He mentioned the drug culture in
                        America as being profoundly worrisome and that somehow we had lost our
                        ideals in the way in which we approach the world.</p>
                    <p>A I was told last year that the public opinion polls in Germany in the second
                        half of the year dramatically changed from showing a declining image of the
                        United States to increasingly favoring the United States. The explanation I
                        was given was the end of the Vietnam war and the decisive handling of the
                        Middle East crisis.</p>
                    <pb n="245" facs="0276" xml:id="pg_245"/>
                    <p>The Germans, the younger Germans, again saw the United States as a nation
                        that could solve problems—and that is one of the elements of the American
                        appeal.</p>
                    <p>America has gone through many changes, dramatic changes, in the last decade.
                        We even began to develop a new isolationism. The old isolationism was based
                        on the proposition that we were too good for this world; the new
                        isolationism was based on the proposition that we’re not good enough for
                        it.</p>
                    <p>When one looks at the process of growing up, it is largely a process of
                        learning one’s limits, that one is not immortal, that one cannot achieve
                        everything; and then to draw from that realization the strength to set great
                        goals nevertheless. Now, I think that as a country we’ve gone through this.
                        We were immature in the sense that we thought the definition of goals was
                        almost the equivalent of their realization.</p>
                    <p>Then we went to the opposite extreme, and I think from this point of view the
                        Kennedy period is likely to be seen as the end of an era, rather than as the
                        beginning of one: the last great flowering of the naive version of American
                        idealism. And I don’t say this as a criticism.</p>
                    <p>I think now that the drug culture, the student rebellion, are in that sense
                        behind us. Of course, we still have the drug culture, but as problems that
                        threaten the spirit of America, I think they either are behind us or could
                        be behind us if we can now do what any adult has to do in his life. When you
                        get to the recognition of your limits, then the question becomes whether you
                        transcend them or wallow in them. That is a choice that is up to us.</p>
                    <p>Q From the period from <persName corresp="#p_RFD_1">Roosevelt</persName>
                        through the Kennedy period, the central theme of this country was that we
                        could do anything in the world, and then we ran into some disappointments
                        and seemed to go into a phase of self-doubt in which we began to wonder
                        whether we could do anything effectively. Now, do we have the
                        self-confidence and the essential trust in one another and in our
                        institutions to support the kind of foreign policy you want?</p>
                    <p>A I have to say this is the big question I ask myself. In some strange way, I
                        think the American people have come through these recent crises in rather
                        good shape. I would not have thought you could have assassinations, the
                        Vietnam war, Watergate, and all that went with it, and still have basic
                        confidence in government.</p>
                    <p>Among the intellectual and political leadership groups, I’m not so sure. But
                        even there, as I said earlier, during the Watergate period, there was
                        support for foreign policy. There is still a remarkable sense of national
                        cohesion, so I am basically optimistic. But above all, I don’t think we have
                        any choice except to try, and in this respect, the American idealistic
                        tradition gives the United States a resource that exists in no other country
                        in the world.</p>
                    <pb n="246" facs="0277" xml:id="pg_246"/>
                    <p>In this country, even with all the isolationism, when you talk about a sense
                        of responsibility, you touch the core of people; you can mention very few
                        other countries of the world where it could be even a plausible
                        argument.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cohesion of the West</p>
                    <p>Q At one point the West was bound together by certain religious ideals,
                        certain moral ideals. What is it that binds the free world together today,
                        if anything?</p>
                    <p>A Well, what binds us together on an unsatisfactory level is industrial
                        civilization which imposes common realities and necessities on all of us. We
                        are also tied together by an approach to politics in which ultimately the
                        fulfillment of human needs plays a central role. Now, the definition of what
                        those needs are can be disputed, but that it does play a crucial role is
                        clear. Indeed, much of the political turmoil in the industrialized world is
                        caused by the uncertainty as to precisely what those deeper needs are.</p>
                    <p>We are tied together, too, by a perception of politics in which various
                        groups and the individual play a crucial role. And the combination of
                        industrial necessity plus the fact that a complicated society cannot be run
                        by direction and must have a certain amount of consensus will in time begin
                        to permeate even totalitarian regimes.</p>
                    <p>Q Do you see the possibility of a closer regional understanding, and even
                        structural development of regionalism, within the Hemisphere in the
                        foreseeable future?</p>
                    <p>A Since I’ve become Secretary of State, I’ve spent a considerable amount of
                        time on Western Hemisphere relationships. If it is true that the relations
                        between industrialized and developing nations are essential features of our
                        period, then in the Western Hemisphere where we are dealing with countries
                        of similar traditions, and indeed, similar history—this is where a beginning
                        must be made. If we cannot solve it creatively here, it is hard to know how
                        we can be creative about it elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>How formal that structure can be, I don’t know. I have found two things: One
                        is that the mere act of dialogue in the Western Hemisphere has had an
                        emotional response; and, secondly, I have been struck in my meetings—I’ve
                        now attended three foreign ministers’ meetings in the Western Hemisphere—by
                        the fact that if one read the records without the mood of the meetings, one
                        would find in them a litany of criticism of the United States. But if one
                        actually was at the meetings, one had the sense that this was a family
                        quarrel; that in some intangible way, one was talking as a member of the
                        family.</p>
                    <p>So I think that in the Western Hemisphere we have the possibilities of a
                        creative phase, provided the United States can shed its traditional <pb
                            n="247" facs="0278" xml:id="pg_247"/>predominance and recognize that the
                        decisions that emerge must be genuinely felt by our friends in the Western
                        Hemisphere to be theirs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Need for Sacrifice</p>
                    <p>Q Is it reasonable for the American people to go on assuming, in a hungry
                        world where raw materials are increasingly scarce, that our standard of
                        living each year can go on going up, or do we have to face new
                        responsibilities and even some sacrifices in this country in order to bring
                        about some kind of world order?</p>
                    <p>A Now, here I’m talking off the top of my head. I would think, if we look
                        ahead to the year 2000 and beyond, we have to be prepared to face a world
                        quite different from what we have now. We see it already in energy. I
                        believe that the day of the 400-horsepower engine is over, whether it’s this
                        year or five years from now. You’re going to see different types of
                        automobiles, and that affects our style of life.</p>
                    <p>We will have to develop a global food policy. We cannot deal with issues like
                        this week’s grain sale to the Soviet Union<note n="4" xml:id="d46fn4">On
                            October 4, <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> placed a hold on
                            wheat and corn contracts that American exporting firms had negotiated
                            with the Soviet Union in order to prevent speculation. See William M.
                            Blair, “2 New Shipments of American Grain to Soviet Halted,” <hi

                        a crash basis every few months. To do so will affect our whole perception of
                        the relationship of agriculture to our society and our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Weakness of Communism</p>
                    <p>Q When you talk about cooperation between the Communists and the capitalist
                        world, where do you see this leading? To the domination of one over the
                        other, or to a combination of the two, or what?</p>
                    <p>A I think that any attempt at domination in a nuclear age is going to involve
                        risks that are catastrophic and would not be tolerated. If we remain strong
                        enough to prevent the imposition of Communist hegemony, then I believe that
                        transformations of the Communist societies are inevitable. I believe that
                        the imposition of state control of the kind that communism demands is
                        totally incompatible with the requirements of human organization at this
                        moment.</p>
                    <p>The pressure of this realization on Communist systems is going to bring about
                        a transformation apart from any conscious policy the United States pursues,
                        so long as there is not a constant foreign danger that can be invoked to
                        impose regimentation.</p>
                    <p>What inherent reason is there that keeps the Communist societies in Eastern
                        Europe from achieving the standard of living of those of Western Europe? The
                        resources are about the same, the industrial orga<pb n="248" facs="0279"
                            xml:id="pg_248"/>nization is there. I think the reason is inherent in
                        the type of society that has been created, and that I believe must
                        inevitably change.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Looking Back</p>
                    <p>Q Looking back over these almost six years, is there anything in the conduct
                        of our foreign policy that you regret, that you would like to change?</p>
                    <p>A I’m quite convinced that I’ll be much more reflective a year or two after I
                        leave here than I can be today. What I regret is that so much of the time
                        had to be spent on the Vietnam war. If we could have got that behind us more
                        rapidly, we could have brought the more positive side of our foreign policy
                        to fruition at a time when attitudes were less rigidly formed.</p>
                    <p>The real tragedy was Watergate, because I believe that at the beginning of
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s second term, we
                        had before us—due to changing conditions—a period of potential creativity.
                        We contributed some of that potential, but some of it was inherent in the
                        objective situation.</p>
                    <p>Instead, we had to spend almost all of our energy in preserving what existed,
                        rather than building on the foundations that had been laid. Even the Year of
                        Europe could have gone differently in a different environment. But you never
                        know what opportunities may have been lost.</p>
                    <p>Those are my big regrets. There are many tactical things I would in
                        retrospect perhaps do differently, but I think it’s premature to speculate
                        on those.</p>
                    <p>Now, what problems I leave to my successor depends, of course, at what time I
                        leave, and I don’t want to have this sound as a valedictory. If I resigned
                        today, he would have the Middle East problem in mid-solution.</p>
                    <p>I think we are now at a point where the framework of the structure exists, if
                        we can put it together. We have the raw material, we have the elements,
                        we’ve identified them, I hope, correctly. We are at the beginning of
                        building a consciousness of the global community that must come after
                        us.</p>
                    <p>Q Can you see a settlement of the Middle East thing in, say, before we get to
                        the Bicentennial, or the end of this Administration?</p>
                    <p>A Before we get to the Bicentennial I think we can make considerable
                        progress, at least to a point where one can see the settlement emerging. But
                        it could also go very badly. That is yet a delicate point.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Role of Intellectuals</p>
                    <p>Q You once said to me that you were relying very heavily—even when you were
                        in the middle of your service in Washington this time—<pb n="249"
                            facs="0280" xml:id="pg_249"/>on concepts and intellectual support you
                        had got from your colleagues in Cambridge way back in ’59, and that you felt
                        a lack of this as time went on. Is that still true?</p>
                    <p>A I think it is true. As I look back, for example, at the area of strategic
                        arms limitation, most of the creative thought with which I am familiar dates
                        back to the late fifties and was then introduced into the Government first
                        in the Kennedy Administration and then, I hope, in ours.</p>
                    <p>Two things are lacking now: One, the same sense of relationship towards the
                        Government that intellectuals had then; now they volunteer less and
                        participate less. Secondly, there is a lack of relevant intellectual
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Intellectuals are now divided into essentially three groups: those that
                        reject the Government totally; those that work on pure, abstract
                        intellectual models which are impossible to make relevant; and a third group
                        that’s too close to power and that sees its service to the Government as
                        residing primarily in day-to-day tactics. No outsider can be very helpful on
                        the day-to-day business because he doesn’t know enough of the current
                        situation to really make a contribution.</p>
                    <p>The best service intellectuals can render is, first, to ask important
                        questions and that’s a difficult problem, and, second, to provide a
                        middle-term perspective. But for that they need to have some compassion for
                        the problems of the policy-maker, just as he needs an understanding of their
                        needs. I feel the lack, and I hope that now that our domestic climate is
                        somewhat better we can restore mutual confidence.</p>
                    <p>Q Was it not a great mistake to wipe out the Office of the Science Adviser
                        who was bringing in objective thought? I felt that lack of it, for example,
                        on the whole question of oil and other raw materials.</p>
                    <p>A I think it’s a pity. I hope that some focal point is created which will
                        look upon the intellectual community as its constituency, and that they will
                        be listened to.</p>
                    <p>Q Just one last point: I take it that you are saying that you don’t want this
                        to be interpreted as a swan song?</p>
                    <p>A Yes.</p>

                    <p>The United Nations World Food Conference commenced in Rome on November 5,
                        1974. Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry
                            Kissinger</persName>, who proposed such a forum during his September 24,
                        1973, speech to the U.N. General Assembly (<ref target="#d17">Document
                            17</ref>), delivered the keynote address on the first day of the
                        conference. After highlighting the dire food supply situation the world
                        faced, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> exhorted: “We must
                        act now and we must act together to regain control over our shared destiny.
                        Catastrophe when it cannot be foreseen can be blamed on a failure of vision
                        or on forces beyond our control. But the current trend is obvious, and the
                        remedy is within our power. If we do not act boldly, disaster will result
                        from a failure of will; moral culpability will be inherent in our
                        foreknowledge.</p>
                    <p>“The political challenge is straightforward: Will the nations of the world
                        cooperate to confront a crisis which is both self-evident and global in
                        nature? Or will each nation or region or bloc see its special advantage as a
                        weapon instead of a contribution? Will we pool our strengths and progress
                        together or test our strengths and sink together?</p>
                    <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> has instructed me to
                        declare on behalf of the United States: We regard our good fortune and
                        strength in the field of food as a global trust. We recognize the
                        responsibilities we bear by virtue of our extraordinary productivity, our
                        advanced technology, and our tradition of assistance. That is why we
                        proposed this conference. That is why a Secretary of State is giving this
                        address. The United States will make a major effort to match its capacity to
                        the magnitude of the challenge. We are convinced that the collective
                        response will have an important influence on the nature of the world that
                        our children inherit.</p>
                    <p>“As we move toward the next century the nations assembled here must begin to
                        fashion a global conception. For we are irreversibly linked to each other—by
                        interdependent economies and human aspirations, by instant communications
                        and nuclear peril. The contemporary agenda of energy, food, and inflation
                        exceeds the capacity of any single government, or even of a few governments
                        together, to resolve.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> devoted the remainder of
                        his address to outlining the historical precedents and current realities of
                        the global food crisis. Resolving the problem required the United States and
                        other nations to mount an “urgent cooperative worldwide action,” designed to
                        increase and accelerate production, improve food quality and distribution
                        networks, and guard against crop emergencies. The Secretary then detailed
                        the ways in which the United States planned to meet these goals and
                        concluded his remarks by stating: “Our responsibility is clear. Let the
                        nations gathered here resolve to confront the challenge, not each <pb
                            n="251" facs="0282" xml:id="pg_251"/>other. Let us agree that the scale
                        and severity of the task require a collaborative effort unprecedented in
                        history. And let us make global cooperation in food a model for our response
                        to other challenges of an interdependent world: energy, inflation,
                        population, protection of the environment.” (Department of State <hi

                    <p>At a December 4 meeting of the International Food Review Group, comprised of
                        representatives from the Departments of State, Treasury, and Agriculture,
                        the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the
                        Council on International Economic Policy, the Economic Policy Board, and the
                        National Security Council, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                        returned to the question of U.S. participation in resolving the food crisis:
                        “First of all, let me explain what I think are the foreign policy interests
                        in the food problem. My hope is that by explaining our foreign policy
                        interests, it will help us in our later considerations. I think that one of
                        the basic strategies we should pursue—what we want to create—is an overall
                        statement of policy toward the food problem in relations to us and in the
                        face of contingencies in the energy and food fields. In my view, systematic
                        planning is one way—probably the only way—that we can get this food problem
                        solved. I think it was a tragedy that the World Food Conference got off onto
                        food aid and did not stick to planning. I wish now that we would have played
                        down the food aid thing. In my view, the answer to the food problem is a
                        systematic approach toward production, stockpiling and so forth.”</p>
                    <p>After Secretary of Agriculture <persName corresp="#p_BEL_1">Earl
                            Butz</persName> expressed his agreement, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> continued: “I think that for us to have gotten
                        into a debate in Rome over who should be giving what was a pity. The basic
                        theme—the basic problem as I see it from a foreign policy viewpoint—is that
                        the food problem is a structural problem of the world economy. And, I think
                        we should correlate our solutions with other countries. One of our major
                        contributions is going to be aid, there is no doubt about that. But, in my
                        opinion, I think it a pity that so many countries are obsessed with this
                        food aid thing. They are off the track.” The memorandum of conversation is

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I wouldn’t do that. I
                        would show him still just a bit then throttle it. Be firm but friendly.</p>
                    <p>President: How many will be in the meetings?</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: With President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>, we had very few.</p>
                    <p>President: I would prefer no private meetings for two reasons: I want to show
                        we are close and friendly. This is the big league.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You are in the <persName

                        worry about your meeting him alone, but we should have a record of it.</p>
                    <p>President: I want them to know we are a team and would prefer not to meet
                        alone.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s see how it goes.
                        You shouldn’t let it look like you are afraid to deal with him alone. You
                        could speak alone and say stay in touch—we both have pressures but we must
                        do our best. Take the Middle East: we must not let the Arabs play us against
                        each other. We eventually have to go back to Geneva.</p>
                    <p>President: Yes, especially if there is a stalemate. They would prove
                        worthwhile only we could make progress.</p>

                        about comparison with <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>. He was
                        a poor negotiator. He was tough in private, but last June he hardly knew
                        what the subject was.<note n="7" xml:id="d48fn7">During the Moscow summit

                        to hit is that we are willing to cooperate in many areas. Be blunt with them

                        way. Act confident. You can say that we always have a unified country in
                        foreign policy on major issues—and that you have great flexibility. You can

                        1980 and our election was on internal issues. Ask him what is on his mind

                    <p>You could mention to <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> the
                        danger of a Japanese-Chinese alliance. Say that is why we want to keep Japan
                        tied to us and that is why we support Japan in Siberia.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese aren’t with us because they like us. They are cold-bloodedly
                        using us. For 10 years we should support the Chinese, then we may have to
                        join the Soviet Union. The Japanese are a great danger. In all their history
                        they’ve never had permanent alignments.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese can do anything. They have such an unusual society that they can
                        adjust to anything. The basic structure of their society can accommodate to
                        any kind of system.</p>
                    <p>If we decline in world power, we will lose the Japanese. They have no
                        psychological understanding of other societies—they do every insensitive
                        thing while being very sensitive themselves. Don’t give <persName

                    <p>Your big problem will be the alliance thing. You should say you share the
                        interest in preserving nuclear peace. Don’t be too negative. You agree with

                    <p>The Secretary: I hope we can have several of these meetings as the new
                        Congress begins. I’d like to get your views on a number of subjects. I hope
                        these sessions will not be confrontations. We hope that we will be able to
                        let you know what our problems are and what Congress might be able to do to
                        help us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAL_1">Holton</persName>: I think we should address
                        first the confidentiality of this session. How do you want to handle it?</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FDM_1">Fraser</persName>: We’ll accept your
                        ground rules.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Since we’d like to discuss a wide variety of matters, I think
                        it would be best to keep all of this off the record.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FDM_1">Fraser</persName>: We appreciate
                        very much the opportunity to meet with you. We know you have a very busy
                        schedule. We also know of the many positive things which have been done
                        recently in the field of human rights; the appointment of human rights
                        officers. We also appreciate very much the assistance which Deputy Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> has been on the Korean
                        human rights problem. We originally proposed this <pb n="257" facs="0288"
                            xml:id="pg_257"/>meeting because of the <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Times</hi> article not too long ago about U.S. involvement in Chilean
                            affairs,<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2">Apparent reference to <persName

                            the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration had
                            authorized the use of millions of dollars for covert activities to
                            undermine the leadership of Chilean President <persName

                            overthrown in a coup d’etat on September 11, 1973.</note> but that is
                        all past history. We’re interested now in where we go from here. About 13 of
                        us had lunch yesterday and all expressed approximately the same sentiment.
                        Basically we feel it’s very difficult to continue to support foreign
                        assistance programs to governments which oppress their own people. We feel
                        that the United States should be putting stronger emphasis on human rights
                        issues in countries around the world. Don’t be mistaken, we are all
                        internationalists and believe that the United States has an important role
                        to play in the world community. As part of the Foreign Aid Bill, for
                        example, we have provided an additional 20 million for Korea if the
                        President reports to Congress that the government of South Korea is making
                        substantial progress in the observance of internationally recognized
                        standards of human rights.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Cranston</persName>: The Aid Bill was
                        decided by one vote in the Senate. Many of us have continuing problems with
                        the Foreign Aid Bill because of the human rights issue.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Let me start by giving you some of my views on the human
                        rights issue—how the United States perceives foreign policy. About one month
                        after I came into office, I spoke at the Pacem In Terris Conference<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d49fn3">See <ref target="#d19">Document 19</ref>.</note>
                        on Gaullism and the greatness of France. I think we have a similar issue in
                        relation to human rights in the U.S. Foreign Policy. The United States
                        stands for something, on that I agree. We have no dispute. I would be
                        prepared to meet with Congressman and Senators to discuss this on any
                        occasion, but there are a number of problems. First there is the issue of
                        tactics. On any given issue, how should we express our views on human rights
                        issues. For example, the current dispute between Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> and the State Department on the
                        emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union. We do not believe in the
                        involvement by the United States in the internal affairs of the Soviet
                            Union.<note n="4" xml:id="d49fn4">See <ref target="#d31">Document
                                31</ref>.</note> This is not going to be helpful in our relations.
                        When we started talking quietly there were only 400 Jews allowed to depart
                        annually. By quiet discussions we were able to build up the number of
                        35,000. In our view it is the results that are important, not the publicity.
                        We’d like to use our better relations with the Soviet Union to permit them
                        to solve their <pb n="258" facs="0289" xml:id="pg_258"/>problem. Take Chile
                        as another example. I could give you a list of representations we’ve made to
                        the Chilean Government on behalf of human rights. I can cite one specific
                        case where Minister Rabasa at an <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>
                        meeting had asked for the release of 200 people who had taken asylum in
                        various embassies in Santiago. I spoke with the Foreign Minister and our
                        Ambassador said things to the General. We said if you can work out some way
                        to release these people, you’ll get the credit. There will be no mention of
                        American involvement. Rabasa went down subsequently and was able to secure
                        their release. Another example is the case of Kudirka the Lithuanian seaman
                        who tried to jump ship a couple of years ago.<note n="5" xml:id="d49fn5">On
                            November 23, 1970, Lithuanian sailor Simas Kudirka attempted to defect
                            to the Coast Guard cutter <hi rend="italic">Vigilant</hi> from a Soviet
                            trawler. Both vessels were linked off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard for
                            talks on North Atlantic fishing rights. The Coast Guard refused
                            sanctuary to Kudirka, and he was forced to return to the Soviet ship.

                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> asked for a general
                        reaffirmation of all former commitments between the United States and the
                        Soviet Union. The President made a very strong pitch about the release of
                        Kudirka. He said we don’t want a cause célèbre. If you can work out a way to
                        release him, we won’t say anything. The Russians released him, we said
                        nothing, but others claimed victory. The Russians were upset and thought we
                        had gone back on our word, which in fact we hadn’t. We had not said anything
                        but others had felt very strongly that they should make something out of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the issue of tactics, there’s a more fundamental issue. I think the
                        best way to explain this might be by using an example from World War II when
                        we made a decision to support the Soviet Union against the Germans. Some
                        countries in certain circumstances must be supported no matter how
                        unpleasant it might seem. A cut off of aid to Turkey, for example, would
                        create larger problems even if we felt Turkey had acted incorrectly. We must
                        not confuse what is convenience with what is essential. Congress has every
                        right to question when issues of national security are raised. Even in
                        national security issues, we should use what influence we have to promote
                        the basic fundamentals of human rights. In determining values we must first
                        define our terms. American institutions cannot be automatically translated
                        and made meaningful to every country in the world.</p>
                    <pb n="259" facs="0290" xml:id="pg_259"/>
                    <p>I look upon the present as being similar to the period right after 1945. We
                        have all suffered, we lack national self confidence and the resources to do
                        many of the things that we would like to do. We cannot afford internal
                        splits at this time. I will do my best to get policies on human rights which
                        you can support, but foreign aid is very important and you must understand
                        that we are not going to be able to meet this stiff criteria which you are
                        setting for human rights in all instances.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_GSM_1">Gibbons</persName>: It is the
                        emphasis on military aid which bothers us. We can see a situation where the
                        United States gets into giving aid to both sides as they did in the
                        Indo-Pakistan situation a couple of years ago.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I think we have to look at the nature of the military
                        governments. The juntas which we find in power in many parts of the world
                        have often imposed themselves on reluctant populations. You can ask the
                        question why do the military take over. Often the military is the only group
                        in the developing society which is open to commoners. An oligarchy is in
                        power and controls everything. The military offers one way that a person can
                        move his way from the bottom to the top. Take the case of Peru. We’re not
                        giving any aid to Peru at the present time, but our inaction is for the
                        wrong reasons. I think it was probably because of the IPC expropriations a
                        couple of years ago. Now the Soviets have sold weapons to Peruvians and the
                        Cubans are offering training to them. Their neighbors are all upset. If we
                        offered training and weapons to countries like Peru, then we have a better
                        control over their policies. </p>
                    <p>Take the example of Korea. Korea has a very strong powerful enemy to the
                        north. The Japanese and other countries in the area rely very heavily on
                        Korea for stability. In the Indo-Pakistani situation the continuing need for
                        spare parts provides us with some influence over their military
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BJB_1">Bingham</persName>: Could you please
                        address the $20 million supplemental program for aid to Korea which is tied
                        to the improvement in the human rights situation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I haven’t thought it through. We’ll have to track it down
                        after the meeting. Let me have a chance to think about it. I can say this
                        though, that we won’t chisel you on the aid or we won’t fight you about
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FDM_1">Fraser</persName>: After being
                        bargained down from a higher figure, we hope the State Department will be
                        able to put this assistance to maximum use.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: You and <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> should
                        have a talk about this.</p>
                    <pb n="260" facs="0291" xml:id="pg_260"/>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FDM_1">Fraser</persName>: Are you aware of

                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Yes, but we were much more concerned about a crack down on the
                        students.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BEG_1">Biester</persName>: We believe that
                        the application of pressure from Congress can be very beneficial.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: The thing that I’m most allergic to is the obligatory
                        statutes. I don’t mind requirements for reports of periodic progress, but I
                        feel very strongly that obligatory requirements are counterproductive.
                        Congress should continue, however, to express its view on human rights.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_HMJ_1">Harrington</persName>: You made a
                        number of interesting statements about Soviet Jewry, internal involvement in
                        affairs of other countries, and Latin American security. I would like to
                        address the issue of our confidence in ourselves and I would like to use the
                        issue of Chile. My point is were not our actions in Chile the cause of the
                        problem there and which results now in the loss of our self confidence.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I didn’t say that all of our military assistance in Latin
                        America was for security reasons. I think we have to look at the issue of
                        the loss of self confidence and explore the reasons for it. There are many
                        explanations. Let me give you my view and then you should feel free to
                        comment. To discuss the case in Chile you would have to go into much more
                        detail then any of us have time for here. I’d like to look at it from the
                        American perspective. If you look at recent American history you’ll see we
                        haven’t had a normal government since the death of Kennedy. First there was
                        his assassination and then there was Bobby’s. <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1"
                            >Lyndon Johnson</persName> got a landslide victory in 1964 but was
                        bogged down very much by Vietnam. The 1968–1972 victories for <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> were tarnished by Watergate. I think
                        that we are a society with simple beliefs. We face a situation where our
                        leaders have been in a constant state of losing credibility. That over time
                        is going to have a profound influence on the future of the United States. I
                        think things are going to be alright so to speak during my tenure—but five
                        years from now, are what’s important.</p>
                    <p>On the issue of Chile I can see two ways that we could be defeated. On the
                        one hand, one could be seeking perfection from all and never satisfied.
                        Everything always seems to require compromise. We take actions on the basis
                        of a series of imperfect conditions. In Chile as in any government there was
                        of course much time pressure. I don’t really agree that your presentation
                        was correct.</p>
                    <pb n="261" facs="0292" xml:id="pg_261"/>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FDM_1">Fraser</persName>: There’s one
                        thought that seems to be shared by all of us and that is we find it
                        difficult to define what’s vital with respect to 3rd world countries. Chile
                        for example is further away than Moscow. I can’t really associate it with a
                        landing in any time in the future on the beaches of California. In the
                        conduct of our foreign relations, it seems there must be a certain kind of
                        decency.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: When we got ourselves involved in Chile, it was perhaps
                        because of an over estimation of the importance of the problem and the
                        effectiveness of our effort. Some countries are important to us and others
                        are not. This is one of the things leaders must determine. Some of the
                        events in the world are important to us and others are not at all in our
                        interest. I agree that a landing on the shores of the United States is not
                        likely in the next 30 years. I see that our danger is a world that will
                        become increasingly radicalized. This in historic terms, I believe, is the
                        biggest threat.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FDM_1">Fraser</persName>: Mr. Secretary, I
                        believe that we need to take a bigger stand—a stronger stand for decency in
                        our foreign relations, not just try to provide military assistance to every
                        country which asks.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: We try to take human rights issues into consideration as long
                        as they do not interfere with our national security.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Cranston</persName>: We have recently
                        completed a study showing that we’re giving aid to 58 countries which were
                        dictatorships. Many of these dictatorships are quite repressive. Our
                        question is: . . . “Is aid to all of these countries necessary?”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I would have to admit that once a program is begun it is
                        sometimes hard to turn off. There are many problems which have to be dealt
                        with. Let me give an example. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>,
                        last October, asked me if I was aware of what was happening in Ethiopia. He
                        pointed out that the Soviet Union was providing military assistance to
                        Somalia, but the United States was no longer giving aid to Ethiopia. He said
                        that we should give Ethiopia more aid. I checked into it and I found that
                        there was a $40 million ceiling for all of Africa. Of that $8 million was
                        going to Ethiopia. I asked for an increase, but it was too late. Look,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s concern was about a
                        stable regime in Africa, but I just wasn’t on the issue as fast as I perhaps
                        should have been. Regarding the 58 countries which you say are
                        dictatorships, we’d be glad to look into it. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1"
                            >Bob Ingersoll</persName> why don’t you look into it.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_RRA_1">Roe</persName>: Mr. Secretary, my
                        constituents and the American people, I believe, are losing faith in foreign
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I’m convinced that the biggest problem we face now is possible
                        economic collapse: fall of the western world. One reason for this is that no
                        country in the world now has a government which is strong enough that it can
                        make difficult decisions. On energy we are witnessing a massive transfer of
                        wealth for the oil producing world. <pb n="262" facs="0293" xml:id="pg_262"
                        />The American people begin to realize this, it will not just be this
                        administration which will be called to question, but our whole system of
                        government. Look what happened at the Food Conference.<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d49fn8">See <ref target="#d47">Document 47</ref>.</note> We
                        publicly stated that we would give a certain amount of food but we actually
                        gave a much higher amount. However, we were identified at the low level,
                        while we were actually giving at a higher level—the highest level of food
                        aid in our history.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Cranston</persName>: I think it is a
                        basic awareness of some of these things that you raised which got the aid
                        bill through the Senate this year. I see three particular problems with aid
                        as it is being administered at the present time. First, our foreign aid
                        frequently becomes military aid. Second, aid is given to countries for
                        political reasons. And third, the aid seems to serve the people who are
                        already powerful.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: This has been a very interesting session. Could we perhaps
                        arrange a meeting again in late January?</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FDM_1">Fraser</persName>: That sounds like
                        a good idea. The Rhodesia chrome debate is tomorrow. That should be of
                        interest to the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BJHJ_1">Buchanan</persName>: The Bill is
                        scheduled to come up tomorrow. We are not sure of the votes. But we are
                        getting much pressure for the repeal of the <persName corresp="#p_BHFJ_1"
                            >Byrd</persName> Amendment<note n="9" xml:id="d49fn9">The <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHFJ_1">Byrd</persName> amendment, Section 503 of the
                            1971 Military Procurement Act, permitted the United States to import
                            Rhodesian chrome, thus circumventing U.N. trade sanctions imposed in
                            1965 against Southern Rhodesia. The amendment was not repealed until
                            March 15, 1977, when Congress passed legislation (P.L. 95–12) giving
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> authority to

                        National Council of Churches. They are all urging us to bring it to a vote
                        tomorrow and not to postpone it any further.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_BEG_1">Biester</persName>: What we need is
                        a letter from the President. This was promised to us but it seems to have
                        gotten sidetracked.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I have supported the repeal of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHFJ_1">Byrd</persName> Amendment as you know in the Finance
                        Committee and in several letters to Senators and Congressmen. I’ll talk to
                        the President tonight about it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAL_1">Holton</persName>: I’m not speaking for the
                        President but as you will recall, we have already met with the House
                        leadership on this. <persName corresp="#p_OTP_1">Tip O’Neill</persName> says
                        we are going to be clobbered on the Rhodesian chrome issue. I don’t think we
                        want the President to lose any credits on this one.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I’m firmly in support of your position on Rhodesian chrome but
                        I know nothing of the President’s letter. I will check with him tonight.</p>

                        a deterioration with the Soviet Union takes place it will also with the

                        opportunity as new patterns become put together. In the past few years our
                        relations with Europe have been very difficult. The Europeans have become
                        provincial: only our efforts are seeking to restore to them a sense of
                        competence to manage their own destinies.</p>

                        look back on this period on the structural side as having been an historic
                        period of American foreign policy.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of domestic policy.]</p>
                    <p>Now let me turn, if I might, to the international dimension of the present
                        crisis. At no time in our peacetime history has the state of the Nation
                        depended more heavily on the state of the world. And seldom, if ever, has
                        the state of the world depended more heavily on the state of our Nation.</p>
                    <p>The economic distress is global. We will not solve it at home unless we help
                        to remedy the profound economic dislocation abroad.<note n="2"

                                >Ford</persName> gave a televised address from the White House
                            Lincoln Library, in which he briefed the public on his programs to
                            address inflation and the energy crisis. The text is ibid., pp.
                            30–35.</note> World trade and monetary structure provides markets,
                        energy, food, and vital raw materials—for all nations. This international
                        system is now in jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>This Nation can be proud of significant achievements in recent years in
                        solving problems and crises. The Berlin agreement, the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreements, our new relationship with
                        China, the unprecedented efforts in the Middle East are immensely
                        encouraging. But the world is not free from crisis. In a world of 150
                        nations, where nuclear technology is proliferating and regional conflicts
                        continue, international security cannot be taken for granted.</p>
                    <p>So, let there be no mistake about it: International cooperation is a vital
                        factor of our lives today. This is not a moment for the American people to
                        turn inward. More than ever before, our own well-being depends on America’s
                        determination and America’s leadership in the whole wide world.</p>
                    <p>We are a great Nation—spiritually, politically, militarily, diplomatically,
                        and economically. America’s commitment to international security has
                        sustained the safety of allies and friends in many areas—in the Middle East,
                        in Europe, and in Asia. Our turning away would unleash new instabilities,
                        new dangers around the globe, which, in turn, would threaten our own
                        security.</p>
                    <p>At the end of World War II, we turned a similar challenge into an historic
                        opportunity and, I might add, an historic achievement. An old order was in
                        disarray; political and economic institutions were shattered. In that
                        period, this Nation and its partners built new institutions, <pb n="266"
                            facs="0297" xml:id="pg_266"/>new mechanisms of mutual support and
                        cooperation. Today, as then, we face an historic opportunity. If we act
                        imaginatively and boldly, as we acted then, this period will in retrospect
                        be seen as one of the great creative moments of our Nation’s history.</p>
                    <p>The whole world is watching to see how we respond.</p>
                    <p>A resurgent American economy would do more to restore the confidence of the
                        world in its own future than anything else we can do. The program that this
                        Congress passes can demonstrate to the world that we have started to put our
                        own house in order. If we can show that this Nation is able and willing to
                        help other nations meet the common challenge, it can demonstrate that the
                        United States will fulfill its responsibilities as a leader among
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>Quite frankly, at stake is the future of industrialized democracies, which
                        have perceived their destiny in common and sustained it in common for 30
                        years.</p>
                    <p>The developing nations are also at a turning point. The poorest nations see
                        their hopes of feeding their hungry and developing their societies shattered
                        by the economic crisis. The long-term economic future for the producers of
                        raw materials also depends on cooperative solutions.</p>
                    <p>Our relations with the Communist countries are a basic factor of the world
                        environment. We must seek to build a long-term basis for coexistence. We
                        will stand by our principles. We will stand by our interests. We will act
                        firmly when challenged. The kind of a world we want depends on a broad
                        policy of creating mutual incentives for restraint and for cooperation.</p>
                    <p>As we move forward to meet our global challenges and opportunities, we must
                        have the tools to do the job.</p>
                    <p>Our military forces are strong and ready. This military strength deters
                        aggression against our allies, stabilizes our relations with former
                        adversaries, and protects our homeland. Fully adequate conventional and
                        strategic forces cost many, many billions, but these dollars are sound
                        insurance for our safety and for a more peaceful world.</p>
                    <p>Military strength alone is not sufficient. Effective diplomacy is also
                        essential in preventing conflict, in building world understanding. The
                        Vladivostok negotiations with the Soviet Union represent a major step in
                        moderating strategic arms competition. My recent discussions with the
                        leaders of the Atlantic community, Japan, and South Korea have contributed
                        to meeting the common challenge.</p>
                    <p>But we have serious problems before us that require cooperation between the
                        President and the Congress. By the Constitution and tradition, the execution
                        of foreign policy is the responsibility of the President.</p>

                    <p>In recent years, under the stress of the Vietnam war, legislative
                        restrictions on the President’s ability to execute foreign policy and
                        military decisions have proliferated.<note n="3" xml:id="d51fn3">The

                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s veto, more

                            prohibited the extension of troop commitments beyond 60 days without
                            specific congressional authorization, and permitted Congress, via
                            concurrent resolution, to direct the president to disengage U.S. troops
                            in the absence of either a declaration of war or congressional
                            authorization.</note> As a Member of the Congress, I opposed some and I
                        approved others. As President, I welcome the advice and cooperation of the
                        House and the Senate.</p>
                    <p>But if our foreign policy is to be successful, we cannot rigidly restrict in
                        legislation the ability of the President to act.<note n="4" xml:id="d51fn4"

                    <p>The Secretary opened the meeting by stating that instead of making a
                        presentation he would answer questions in order that the session be a more
                        productive one for the Members.</p>
                    <pb n="269" facs="0300" xml:id="pg_269"/>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_SAW_1">Steelman</persName> asked the
                        Secretary what our oil policy was in view of the Administration’s goal of a
                        production reduction to $1 million [<hi rend="italic">1 million
                        barrels</hi>] a day reduction. The Secretary responded that the United
                        States needed a longer term strategy of a 4–5 year period. He stated that
                        our policy had two objectives: (1) to bring oil prices down; and (2) to make
                        sure that our dependence on foreign sources does not increase. The Secretary
                        said that we are working towards (1) increasing the pressure on <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> countries to reduce prices; and (2)
                        finding the most effective consumer position directed at locating substitute
                        sources of energy. He stated that the figure of one million barrels a day
                        had been used as the recession figure. The Secretary said we should make
                        every effort to achieve that strategy, so that we can dispel the notion that
                        the U.S. is dragging others along only to save themselves. The upcoming
                        energy conference of consumers, said the Secretary, was not decisive, but
                        one that would set the general strategy and goals in addition to trying to
                        break the oil cartel.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CBBJ_1">Conable</persName> stated that
                        although he agreed that military aid was an appropriate weapon of diplomacy,
                        that there was confusion as to when we should use it. The Congressman said
                        that on this score their Democratic colleagues were criticizing them for our
                        military assistance policies. He stated that we have recently decided to
                        reinstate military aid to Pakistan and that we had just asked the Congress
                        for supplemental assistance for Vietnam and Cambodia.<note n="2"

                                >Kissinger</persName> underscored the importance of the $522 million
                            supplemental in relation to the administration’s broader foreign policy
                            aims. Failure to pass the measure, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> argued, would “hurt our credibility
                            world-wide. Our allies must know that we will stand by them and by any
                            agreements we have with them. It will hurt our international negotiating
                            power, if we do not stand in South Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName> concurred: “Our global relationships are very
                            important. It is necessary for people around the world to know that we
                            will stand by our allies. As we deal internationally, what we say in the
                            Middle East or Southeast Asia or in détente with Russia or China, that
                            they can count on those statements as being backed by the American
                            people, and the American Congress. It will impair our international
                            negotiating ability if it always hinges on the domestic question of
                            whether or not Congress will approve.” (Notes of a Cabinet meeting,
                            January 29; <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> Library,
                            Cabinet Meetings, Box 1, 1/29/75)</note> The Congressman asked the
                        Secretary whether there was any rule of thumb on what was or was not a
                        constructive policy on military aid.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that the main problem in foreign policy was the lack of
                        a national consensus on what the needs, goals, and direction of our foreign
                        policy should be. The Secretary indicated that the objectives of military
                        assistance could be linked to the Cyprus situation but not necessarily to
                        trade negotiations. He stated that military aid can be <pb n="270"
                            facs="0301" xml:id="pg_270"/>given for many reasons, and that the
                        obvious one was the protection of areas vital to our security; another
                        obvious reason for military assistance, according to the Secretary, was for
                        people like our allies for defense in their military purposes. The Secretary
                        stated that if the Congress and the Executive Branch agreed that an area was
                        vital, then there was no problem. Saudi Arabia, he said, was a key country
                        in the Arab world for the following reasons: first, it had an enormous
                        surplus production of oil; second, it had an unlimited surplus of
                        petrodollars; third, it was the only country that could make an embargo
                        stick. The Secretary said that Iran and Algeria could not afford to cut
                        production, since most of their raw income was mortgaged for development
                        projects. The Secretary maintained that the bilateral projects that we have
                        initiated with the Saudis are for development purposes. One constant
                        problem, said the Secretary, was the necessity to keep Saudi Arabia
                        satisfied and on our side.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stressed that we want a political relationship with the Saudis
                        whereby they tie their conception of their security to ours. In this
                        context, said the Secretary, we have agreed to sell them arms. The Secretary
                        stated that if we did not do this, that France and Great Britain would step
                        in there, thus reducing our influence. The objectives of the French and
                        British, on the Middle East, said the Secretary, are different from ours.
                        The Secretary stressed that the success of his upcoming negotiations
                        depended on Faisal. The Secretary stated we would be in trouble if Faisal
                        decided to back Syria and threatened to withhold money from Egypt. The
                        Secretary then said that if Faisal stayed on the fence, then we would be
                        okay. In all of the important Arab forums, according to the Secretary, King
                        Faisal is decisive. The Bedouin society is extremely important, said the
                        Secretary. The Secretary then stressed that France and Great Britain did not
                        have the same political objectives that we had, and that their presence
                        would not help matters. As for Iran, said the Secretary, they could not take
                        the drastic foreign policy steps that Saudi Arabia could take.</p>
                    <p>The Pakistan case, said the Secretary, was an anomaly. Here was an ally of
                        ours, he said, and yet we had been embargoing it at a time when its neighbor
                        had been receiving one billion dollars a year in arms. The Secretary said he
                        could not understand why we had embargoed Pakistan. As for the recent
                        decision to resume arms sales to Pakistan, said the Secretary, we decided on
                        the most minimal cash sale as strictly a symbolic step; there was no
                        military mission involved, no escalation of the arms race which would alter
                        the balance of power in the area. The Secretary stated that we just wanted
                        to eliminate the political anomaly in that area. France and Great Britain,
                        said the Secretary, sell arms to Pakistan. The Secretary stated that this
                        sale will not affect our relations with India since we made clear to them
                        what our objectives <pb n="271" facs="0302" xml:id="pg_271"/>were before we
                        announced our decision. The local Indian Ambassador, said the Secretary, got
                        carried away in his reaction. One goal of our foreign policy, stressed the
                        Secretary, was not to get involved in an arms race in the subcontinent. We
                        can regulate this matter by the amounts we sell to Pakistan as well as the
                        amounts of ready cash that they have to pay for these arms, stated the
                        Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then stated that he wanted to discuss the supplemental requests
                        for Vietnam and Cambodia. On the Indochina issue, said the Secretary, we
                        have all been anguished for many years. It was an issue that was very hard
                        on both him and the Congressmen present. The Secretary said that he received
                        many letters on this topic also. He stated that he was saddened by the
                        present rhetoric of the debate on this issue; he felt that the rhetoric
                        being used at the present time was one of the past, and that this was an
                        entirely new issue. With respect to Cambodia, the Secretary said, the issue
                        was whether the United States would condemn the people and country that have
                        stood by us by refusing to send them ammunition. The Secretary said that
                        this responsibility of denying them these arms was very great to assume,
                        even if the Cambodians lost. The Secretary said that in his judgment the
                        U.S. had exhausted all of the peacekeeping possibilities; he said we
                        consulted every Asian leader, focusing on progressive leaders and not
                        military dictators, to help us towards our negotiating objectives. The Prime
                        Minister of Singapore and other leaders that we consulted concluded that
                        there were no prospects for negotiations in view of the military situation,
                        said the Secretary. He stated that in December the French almost got
                        negotiations started again. He said that the present Cambodian conflict had
                        to be settled.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that with respect to Vietnam, the question of whether we
                        should have gone in will be settled by history. He stated that a strong case
                        could not be made in American society for helping the South Vietnamese yet
                        there were millions of people in South Vietnam that we have propelled into
                        this kind of situation. He said he always heard from everyone that we ought
                        to get our troops and our prisoners out and then to let the South Vietnamese
                        defend themselves. Never did he hear, the Secretary said, that we should
                        give them aid to defend themselves with; the Secretary then stressed that by
                        denying the military aid we were condemning them; that, the Secretary
                        considered, was an immoral act. The Secretary stated that he could not
                        honestly tell them (the Congressmen) that there was a terminal date to our
                        providing this aid. The Secretary said that last summer he felt that there
                        was no way the North Vietnamese could win militarily after efforts at
                        further negotiations failed. He stated that his view was that the Congress
                        should vote adequate aid as long as it was necessary, but that <pb n="272"
                            facs="0303" xml:id="pg_272"/>one could not put a terminal date on it. If
                        we did announce this terminal date, said the Secretary, it would jeopardize
                        our security interests in the Middle East and all other areas of our
                        interest. According to the Secretary, the perfect example of what has
                        happened is the <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName>
                            amendment,<note n="3" xml:id="d52fn3">See <ref target="#d19fn3">footnote

                        can get. The <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> amendment was
                        better than no trade bill at all; therefore, the Secretary said, a cut off
                        is better than cutting it (the aid for South Vietnam) off completely. In
                        Vietnam’s case, the Secretary stated, it was better to go for three years
                        with a maximum effort. He stated that there were different reasons for
                        military aid in different parts of the world; in most cases, said the
                        Secretary, American security depends on this.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_EML_1">Esch</persName> stated that he was a
                        member of a Congressional group that met in this same room with the
                        Secretary’s predecessor in 1967 to discuss the issues that were being
                        discussed at this meeting. Congressman <persName corresp="#p_EML_1"
                            >Esch</persName> then asked if it was unrealistic to expect whether we
                        can apply leverage to China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        to halt their arms supplies into that area.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that although the word leverage was easy to use that it
                        was very hard to define. He then stated that he would like to get together
                        with a few Congressmen and ask them to write down what leverage they feel we
                        have. With the Soviet Union, the Secretary felt our leverage was economic.
                        He said it was prestigious for them to have a close association in an
                        economic partnership with us. Should the Russians kick up the arms race in
                        the area, we just cannot retaliate by cutting off credits since our economic
                        cards hardly exist anymore. There is no credible threat, said the Secretary,
                        which indicates an increasing arms race in that area. Our total leverage,
                        said the Secretary, was shrinking and thus détente was suffering. The
                        Secretary said that every negotiation with the Soviets is tougher because we
                        have less chips to offer.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then stated that we have one source of leverage with China:
                        they need us for a balance of power. He said that the press keeps saying
                        that Taiwan is the key issue in blocking better relations. The Secretary
                        stressed that it was not Taiwan that brought us together, but rather the
                        Chinese desire to hold the ring around Russia.</p>
                    <p>According to the Secretary, the Turkey issue had done considerable damage to
                        our relations with China. In this case, said the Secretary, here they see
                        the United States cutting off aid to a country that stands <pb n="273"

                            administration subsequently sided with Turkey in the conflict in order

                            to the disapproval of many Greek-Americans. Members of Congress sought
                            to curb U.S. involvement with two joint resolutions eliminating further
                            U.S. military aid, initiatives that <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName> vetoed. Ultimately the administration and Congress
                            brokered a compromise: House Joint Resolution 1167 of October 17, 1974,
                            P.L. 93–448, prohibited the administration from offering military
                            assistance to Turkey until <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>
                            certified that Turkey was in compliance with the Foreign Assistance Act
                            of 1961 and the Foreign Military Sales Act and progress in negotiations
                            had been made. The embargo took effect on February 5, 1975, and lasted,
                            with some modifications, until 1978.</note> The Secretary said the
                        Chinese then question whether we can deliver; their factors, stated the
                        Secretary, blunt off any effort by him in asking the Chinese to please cut
                        off arms to Indochina. In the right circumstances, said the Secretary, we
                        could go in with the Chinese. The Secretary stated that the South Vietnamese
                        had to defend their northern frontier and that they were running short of
                        ammunition. The North Vietnamese, said the Secretary, had to be strong to
                        have taken the provincial capital.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HMO_1">Hatfield</persName> asked the Secretary
                        what our commitment was to the Cambodian government. He said that he
                        recalled a hearing before his Appropriations Committee where Under Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_TCW_1">Tarr</persName> reiterated that there was
                        no commitment to Cambodia, that the purpose of our policy was only to
                        protect American troops. Senator <persName corresp="#p_HMO_1"
                            >Hatfield</persName> stated that now he was not so sure, and said he
                        wanted to know why the Secretary had requested the recent $222 million aid
                        package for Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that we do not have a formal commitment to Cambodia, but
                        something deeper. The Secretary again stressed that the U.S. had no formal
                        defense or political commitment to Cambodia, and that we have not said to
                        them that we will defend them. What had to be distinguished, said the
                        Secretary, was the nature of our relationship; in other words, stated the
                        Secretary, how our actions vis-à-vis the Cambodians will be perceived in the
                        world. Should we refuse to send them ammunition, said the Secretary, that
                        would be morally wrong and inequitable.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CRL_1">Coughlin</persName> asked how much
                        money it would take the Cambodians to get them through the monsoon.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CRL_1">Coughlin</persName> stated that the
                        Executive Branch had requested $752 million for Indochina and now an
                        additional $222 million for Cambodia. <persName corresp="#p_CRL_1"
                            >Coughlin</persName> asked whether so much money was needed; wouldn’t
                        $100 million be sufficient, he asked.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he was no expert at numbers, that what was
                        requested was the minimum that was essentially needed.</p>
                    <pb n="274" facs="0305" xml:id="pg_274"/>
                    <p>Congressman Anderson stated that the U.S. engaged in nearly $8 billion worth
                        of arms sales around the world. He said that he was troubled at what the
                        Secretary had said earlier; it seemed to him that our policy was based on
                        keeping up with the Joneses, i.e. the fact that if France and Great Britain
                        do it, we should do it too. The Congressman asked the Secretary whether the
                        United States could exercise influence on developing countries to use their
                        funds for development projects rather than for military purposes.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that the biggest purchasers of arms were not
                        impoverished nations, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc. He said that with
                        each of these countries we have set up economic commissions to promote
                        economic development. The Secretary asked at what price could we keep some
                        of these countries from buying arms to modernize their military forces for
                        their own security purposes. The Secretary stated that we had suffered more
                        by denying countries our sales; Peru, said the Secretary, was the perfect
                        example of this short-sighted policy. The U.S., said the Secretary, refused
                        to sell arms to the Peruvians so as to redirect their funds for development
                        purposes. What happened next, said the Secretary, was that the Peruvians
                        bought 200 Soviet tanks and brought in Cuban technicians. The Secretary
                        stated that we hardly gained from this situation, and that we placed
                        ourselves in a very difficult situation. In general, the Secretary said that
                        we do encourage countries to put their funds into development rather than
                        for arms.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_HFJ_1">Horton</persName> asked what the
                        prospects were for a Middle East settlement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated there were three problems in negotiations, (1) Egypt and
                        Israeli relations; (2) relations between Egypt and other countries; and (3)
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and other nations in the area. He
                        stated that Egypt and Israel were getting along better. With a little bit of
                        luck, the Secretary said that chances for success were slightly better than
                        50/50. Tonight, the Secretary said, he and <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Joe
                            Sisco</persName> had sent a message to all the countries that they would
                        be visiting,<note n="5" xml:id="d52fn5">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was in the Middle East
                            March 8–18 to review the peace process and discuss the disengagement of
                            Egyptian-Israeli forces.</note> asking everyone to do a little thinking
                        on their own, that the U.S. is not going to do it all. One of the key
                        issues, stated the Secretary, was whether Syria could mobilize Arab support
                        to kill any kind of rapprochement between Egypt and Syria. The Secretary
                        said that in <persName corresp="#p_AH_1">Assad</persName>’s view, for
                            <persName corresp="#p_AH_1">Assad</persName> to gain nothing while Egypt
                        gains something was bad. He said that <persName corresp="#p_AH_1"
                            >Assad</persName> was playing all his cards: Arab unity, flirtations
                        with the Palestinians. If there is movement on the Golan Heights issue, said
                        the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_AH_1">Assad</persName> will keep quiet.
                        Whether he can mobilize pressure, said the Secretary, depended in large part
                        on other countries and the Palestinians. With re<pb n="275" facs="0306"
                            xml:id="pg_275"/>spect to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,
                        stated the Secretary, they so far have been more obnoxious than
                        obstructionist. Should the Soviets start a massive diplomatic campaign, said
                        the Secretary, that will be a bad thing. The Secretary said that if the
                        radical Arabs win, then it will mean the defeat of moderate Arabs, moderate
                        programs, and the United States at Geneva. If the U.S. fails, said the
                        Secretary, the Soviets and the radical Arabs will be successful, causing a
                        nightmare. The end result, said the Secretary, would be that moderate Arabs
                        would be discredited, the Soviets would win, and the worst results for
                        Israel. The key issue, said the Secretary, is what position we are in when
                        we go to Geneva.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_RPE_1">Ruppe</persName> stated that it was
                        his understanding that King Faisal would not be content until he got to pray
                        in Jerusalem. Since the Secretary seemed to indicate that Faisal was the
                        linchpin of the Middle East, didn’t this factor have to be taken into
                        account.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that in one sense Saudi Arabia was a linchpin, in
                        another sense it was not. The Secretary said that when one first perceives
                        Faisal, he appears as a real fanatic. The Secretary stated, however, that
                        Faisal was a very canny operator. He sits, said the Secretary, on $200
                        billion worth of reserves and 8 million Bedouins, and makes the rounds
                        successfully with his ambiguous postures. Faisal, said the Secretary, gets
                        the conservatives by appearing as a religious fanatic, and then gets the
                        support of the radicals by espousal of the Palestinian issue. The Secretary
                        stated that Faisal never exposes himself, and talks in riddles to keep all
                        his options open. A colleague of his, said the Secretary, once told me
                            (<gloss target="#t_HAK_1">HAK</gloss>) that if Faisal would tell the
                        Secretary that he would not go ahead with an embargo, then he would do it.
                        The Secretary said that Faisal was a very complicated man, and that he
                        probably does want to die in Jerusalem. The mistake people make about
                        Faisal, however, said the Secretary, is that they think he wants to hear
                        about Jerusalem. In all the conversations that he has ever had with Faisal,
                        stated the Secretary, Faisal has never raised the Jerusalem issue nor the
                        ’67 borders issue. He is an extremely practical man, said the Secretary, and
                        on the Syrian front, he will go along. How he will come down on the totality
                        of issues, said the Secretary, nobody knows. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                            >Sadat</persName>, said the Secretary, may ask him to support him, and
                        Faisal may go ahead and do it. If you want to talk philosophy with Faisal,
                        the Secretary stated, he has a standard 45 minute speech on Zionism and
                        Communism.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_SR_1">Schweiker</persName> then said that our
                        problem with Cambodia was that we were playing a Catch 22 policy there. It
                        seems, said the Senator, that we have to prove our virility and our manhood
                        and that we are using the old Cold War logic that we have to do it if the
                        Commies do it. Then our only policy, said <persName corresp="#p_SR_1"
                            >Schweiker</persName>, is to respond to that Cold War logic and to the
                        eventual neglect of other areas.</p>
                    <pb n="276" facs="0307" xml:id="pg_276"/>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that before we get involved in something again, that we
                        will think it over extremely carefully, since the Indochina experience has
                        shown how hard it is to disengage. A total refusal to the Cambodians, said
                        the Secretary, was condemnatory and the wrong way to end the war, a big
                        mistake. The U.S. action in Cambodia, said the Secretary, when we became
                        involved with the sanctuaries, saved thousands of lives. At the present
                        time, stated the Secretary, the Cambodian situation was an extremely
                        dangerous one, and it may get worse when the rainy season starts again.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CWS_1">Cohen</persName> stated that in

                        and Chuck <persName corresp="#p_CCW_1">Colson</persName> had said that the
                        Secretary was one of the more dangerous and unstable men in the world.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that it was a lucky thing that <persName
                            corresp="#p_CCW_1">Colson</persName> had converted to Christianity,
                        otherwise he (<gloss target="#t_HAK_1">HAK</gloss>) would hate to speculate
                        what <persName corresp="#p_CCW_1">Colson</persName> would have said if he
                        had not.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CWS_1">Cohen</persName> then said that the
                        Secretary had talked about Congressional intervention in foreign policy in
                        several forums.<note n="6" xml:id="d52fn6">During a January 24 address to
                            the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> noted: “The growing tendency of the Congress
                            to legislate in detail the day-to-day or week-to-week conduct of our
                            foreign affairs raises grave issues. American policy—given the wide
                            range of our interests and responsibilities—must be a coherent and a
                            purposeful whole. The way we act in our relations with one country
                            almost inevitably affects our relationship with others. To single out
                            individual countries for special legislative attention has unintended
                            but inevitable consequences and risks unraveling the entire fabric of
                            our foreign policy.” For the complete text of <persName

                            The Secretary also offered remarks in this vein during his February 25
                            news conference, stressing that “there can only be an American foreign
                            policy, not an executive or a legislative foreign policy.” (Ibid., March
                            17, 1975, p. 322)</note> Would the Secretary elaborate on this
                        point.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that it was disastrous to operate a foreign policy
                        without the support of Congress and the public. He stated that he strongly
                        believed in Congressional consultation. When he was at the White House as
                        Assistant to the President, he often met with the Senate Foreign Relations
                        Committee and especially Chairman <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1"
                            >Fulbright</persName>. There was nothing in it for him (<gloss
                            target="#t_HAK_1">HAK</gloss>) at the time, said the Secretary, yet he
                        did it. The Secretary said he was extremely concerned with establishing a
                        partnership with Congress, yet it was technically difficult to consult with
                        this Congress. The Secretary said he meets three times a week with groups
                        like these, yet he did not know which of the Congressmen he meets with can
                        deliver. Consultation with the Congress, said the Secretary, is a technical
                        problem, which is the Congress’ problem, not his. The Secretary stated that
                        he was perplexed at what was happening to the Committee structure, but that
                        it was not affecting him.</p>
                    <pb n="277" facs="0308" xml:id="pg_277"/>
                    <p>The Secretary asked what the role of Congress should be in foreign
                        policy-making. Trying to mess in the day-to-day conduct is often dangerous
                        and destructive. Foreign policy was a series of moods, nuances, and
                        continuity, and there is a loss if there is a day-to-day intrusion in its
                        conduct. Foreign policy, said the Secretary, is like a chess game; one can
                        knock out yards than wonder if it disintegrates. What Congress can do,
                        stated the Secretary, has not been figured out; the Congress, said the
                        Secretary can make important inputs in longer term trends. With respect to
                        Cambodia and Vietnam, the Secretary stated that he had not complained of the
                        Congressional prerogative of appropriating funds. Congress, said the
                        Secretary, exercises the right of supervision in this field.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then stressed that the aid cut off to Turkey, however, was a
                        calamity for all of the U.S. Congress, and that the chief victim will be the
                        democratic Greek government. What happens is that Turkey is driven away from
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, said the Secretary, and the
                        situation does not help Cyprus. Congress’ action was an unnecessary move, a
                        very serious interference, stated the Secretary. Negotiations had to be
                        given a chance to develop on the Greek-Turk issue, but then the ax fell. The
                        impact of this action, stated the Secretary, on the perception of other
                        countries towards our ability to honor commitments is in the long term
                        disastrous.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then referred to the <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1"
                            >Jackson</persName> Amendment and stated that he agreed with <persName
                            corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName>’s intent and his objectives.
                        Congress can tell us its concerns, said the Secretary, and then we can get
                        together. Should these trends continue, stated the Secretary, these
                        interferences will create a lack of confidence in the ability of the United
                        States to deliver, resulting in a disintegration of our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_RPE_1">Ruppe</persName> then stated that
                        the average guy in his district asks why we give all these funds and credits
                        to the Communists.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that Europe had given over 7½ billion credits to the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, creating a leverage on the
                        Russians. Perhaps, stated the Secretary, we did not explain our strategy
                        adequately. In terms of the Middle East crisis, said the Secretary, there
                        are few obstacles for the Soviet Union: the only danger for them is the
                        threat of our military involvement and thus they have little to lose in the
                        whole process.</p>
                    <p>Congressman Anderson adjourned the session and thanked the Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then told Anderson, <persName corresp="#p_CWS_1"
                            >Cohen</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RPE_1">Ruppe</persName>, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_HFJ_1">Horton</persName> (as they were leaving)
                        that he wished he could find five key people in the Congress that could
                        deliver, and let them read cables so that they form a partnership.
                        Congressman Anderson agreed that there was a vacuum of leadership.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Joseph Sisco</persName>. According to a
                        memorandum of conversation prepared by <persName corresp="#p_BLP_1">L. Paul
                            Bremer</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                        expounded on the difficulties facing the implementation and execution of
                        U.S. foreign policy:</p>
                    <p>“Now, if we might spend 20 minutes on some other problems. I want to say a
                        few things about my very profound concern about the paralysis which we are
                        inflicting upon ourselves on a global basis. You know most foreign policy
                        setbacks are inflicted by foreigners. Ours instead are being inflicted by
                        ourselves. We probably can’t settle anything about this today and maybe we
                        ought to meet again next week.”</p>
                    <p>After a brief discussion of the domestic political climate in Portugal,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> turned to the role of
                        intelligence in the conduct of American policy:</p>
                    <p>“A superpower in this world without effective intelligence machinery is in
                        deep trouble. If these congressional investigations don’t come to a quick
                        end, it will unravel every covert activity over the past twenty years. In
                        fact, many more were conducted before 1969 than after. If these come out
                        separated from their context, it will lead to the destruction of any
                        intelligence capacity.”</p>
                    <p>Following a brief description of U.S.-Portuguese relations, <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> continued:</p>
                    <p>“We have inflicted a serious setback on ourselves. There have been no new
                        Forty Committee actions since the <persName corresp="#p_RJD_1"
                            >Ryan</persName> amendment, since the President must certify it is in
                        the national interest to undertake a covert activity, and since we must also
                        brief about 50 congressmen on each activity. Now you gentlemen know that no
                        covert operation has ever been ordered which the President wasn’t informed
                        of. He always had a chance to disapprove it if he wanted. But it makes a
                        very big difference if it is done in a disavowable mode where, if something
                        goes wrong, the blame goes to the Assistant to the President or to the
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Director instead of having
                        something on file which the President has signed. And you simply cannot
                        brief 50 congressmen on a covert activity and expect it to be kept
                        covert.</p>
                    <p>“This group should know. Perhaps there have been excesses in the past and
                        perhaps covert operations need to be more tightly controlled. But in the
                        last three months we’ve had no Forty Committee meetings and the only thing
                        we’ve even discussed was that damn ship.</p>
                    <pb n="279" facs="0310" xml:id="pg_279"/>
                    <p>“Even though the myth is that the Assistant to the President generates covert
                        proposals, this is simply not true. He does nothing without proposals and
                        I’ll tell you we are getting none today. Take Saudi Arabia—I would dearly
                        like to know what is going on in the national guard, and in the army and in
                        the court, but I can’t.</p>
                    <p>“I’m raising national problems here with you. We’ve had eight years of
                        Vietnam and two years of Watergate and these have made this a national
                        problem.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> referred to the
                            Hughes-<persName corresp="#p_RJD_1">Ryan</persName> amendment to the
                        Foreign Assistance Act of 1974, signed December 30, 1974 (P.L. 93–559),
                        which required explicit approval by the President for covert actions and
                        expanded Congressional oversight and control of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                            >CIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>After a brief discussion of Cyprus, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> returned to this theme:</p>
                    <p>“With the exception of Vietnam which I would like to discuss at some point,
                        in all of your experiences foreign policy has been discussed in terms of our
                        overall policy. It is now being handled like domestic policy with every
                        pressure group going up there [to Congress] with their own projects. I had
                        our people look into the restrictions which now operate on foreign policy
                        and I was given a list 21 pages long of restrictions.</p>
                    <p>“At one point I even showed [Representative John] <persName corresp="#p_BJ_1"
                            >Brademas</persName> all of our cables just to show him we were serious
                        and all he did was second-guess each one of the cables. This policy
                        obviously leads to the disintegration of a coherent foreign policy. We’re
                        not even talking here about the <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1"
                            >Jackson</persName> amendment. The price we paid to promote Jewish
                        emigration from the Soviet Union which in my view is not a legitimate goal
                        of U.S. policy anyway is unbelievable, especially since we had already
                        gotten emigration to go up from 4,000 to 30,000 per year.</p>
                    <p>“I am profoundly worried about how we now appear to other countries. Our
                        authority has for 30 years preserved the peace of the world. If we behave
                        like the French governments of the Third and Fourth Republics, the peace of
                        the world will be in the most severe jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>“We can argue how to handle the Cyprus thing, but at some point the
                        administration simply has to be in charge of the tactics of foreign policy.
                        If we do a lousy job, either get us out in the next election or attack the
                        general direction of the policy.</p>
                    <p>“There is one problem which is that there is no one in Congress we can talk
                        to.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>: The broader point is
                        very powerful. Looking at the domestic side of life now, which is being
                        governed by very narrow often noble little cutup groups of people, policy
                        makers are not allowed <pb n="280" facs="0311" xml:id="pg_280"/>to make a
                        balanced judgment, but must make narrow ones confined to specific issues.
                        This leads to an incapacity for leadership and to disorganization.</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Since the
                        Second World War whether you agree or not there has been a basic agreement
                        that the U.S. stands for something. Now people wonder if anything we say or
                        undertake can be carried out.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD_1">Dillon</persName>: Our performance
                        domestically is really just as bad and it too is similar to the Third and
                        Fourth Republics.</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This group here
                        has given structure to our policy over a long time.</p>
                    <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE_1">Bruce</persName>: I see this only
                        from the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> perspective. The decline of
                        U.S. prestige is almost humiliating. The causes are not what they appear to
                        be. Many Europeans don’t understand it because they’re accustomed to the
                        parliamentary system in Europe. They continue to say that only the United
                        States can give leadership, but they don’t trust that it will be given at
                        all or that it will be given wisely. Also, we are speaking in a much too
                        defeatist way about ourselves, both in the news or among our congressmen. If
                        you read about the seven senators, all of whom are on the Senate Foreign
                        Relations Committee, who are traveling in Europe, their questions are simply
                        not absorbable. The Europeans are confused about who these people are. One
                        of the men in Brussels I asked said I would be glad to brief these people,
                        but they don’t understand the problems.</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It seems to me
                        that we are almost inviting some misbehavior from the Soviets. From what I
                        know of the Chinese, there is no sentimentality there. They want us to hold
                        the ring with the Soviets. If they get contempt for us, they could get very
                        tough with Japan, and the Third World. We have to pull ourselves together
                        fast.</p>
                    <p>“Vietnam is another problem. I’d be prepared to and even eager to meet again
                        with this group on that. I am profoundly worried. I think my basic analysis
                        about the state of the world is right. And I think I can use your help on
                        the Middle East.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,

                        1967 frontiers, and the Soviet Union was deeply in<pb n="281" facs="0312"

                        were completely isolated, and any war and its impact over the world would be
                        ascribed to American and Israeli intransigence. With <persName
                            corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s cooperation, we moved to the
                        step-by-step approach. We kept the Soviet Union and Europeans on the
                        sidelines and we kept the moderates in control. We recommended to Israel
                        that it seek movement with Jordan and in the Sinai. The delays in this
                        process brought about the result of Rabat, replacing Hussein with the <gloss

                        consideration of all the issues.</p>
                    <p>“So there were two elements in these negotiations: the substance itself and
                        the continuation of a process which would preserve the situation and [<hi

                        added, “My own tentative inclination is that we will want to develop a
                        strategy which carefully capitalizes on mounting pressures to build domestic
                        support and to move the negotiations forward. This will require a thoughtful

                    <p>In examining both the short and longer term implications of the current
                        crisis we start from the proposition that Indochina will fall under
                        communist control and be subject to the influence and direction of
                            Hanoi.<note n="3" xml:id="d54fn3">North Vietnam began a major military
                            offensive in March; by early April, North Vietnamese troops were

                    </p>
                    <p>Three interlocking sets of implications need to be considered: (1)
                        internally, how a defeat in Vietnam, whatever its form, will impact on the
                        present American mood and what the consequences are likely to be for
                        national policy; (2) externally, how it will impact in Asia, especially on
                        major power relations; and (3) finally, what it means for our global
                        posture.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Domestic Perspective</p>
                    <p>As disappointing and frustrating as it may be, the hard political fact is
                        that the popular mood and the dominant Congressional opinion are to accept
                        the defeat of <gloss target="#t_SVN_1">SVN</gloss> as historically
                        inevitable. It is not all that surprising that, given the polarization of
                        opinion, the trend that has prevailed is one of disinterest and
                        disengagement.</p>
                    <p>Seen in a longer term perspective, we are reaping in the harvest of the
                        aberation of American predominance in the postwar era: as we return to a
                        period of retrenchment and consolidation, which was articulated in the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine,<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d54fn4">See <ref target="#d9fn2">footnote 2, Document

                        cannot or will not help themselves, and will therefore collapse. Southeast
                        Asia, an area in almost constant turmoil since the Japa<pb n="283"
                            facs="0314" xml:id="pg_283"/>nese invasion, is a classic vacuum of
                        power, where indigenous forces have had only an outside chance of organizing
                        a cohesive political, economic and military structure.</p>
                    <p>Our involvement in Southeast Asia was a particular historical distortion, if
                        only because our general posture in Asia has oscillated between period of
                        moralizing accompanied by inaction or bursts of quasi-imperialism followed
                        by lapses into passivity. In particular, we have never resolved the
                        historical debate over whether the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> should
                        ever become engaged on the Asian mainland.</p>
                    <p>The net result has been that our Asian-Pacific policy has been characterized
                        by incoherence or ambivalence. Moreover, the very sources of domestic
                        support that insisted on a crusading mission in the postwar period were
                        among the first to become disenchanted when that policy finally encountered
                        a problem incapable of immediate resolution. With growing nostalgia

                        political-ideological rationale was the same in each instance.</p>
                    <p>In short, the agony of Vietnam coincides with and contributes to another
                        massive swing of opinion toward a kind of utopian revolt against power
                        politics in Asia, disguised as a moral preference for humanitarianism and
                        interdependence. The Tonkin Gulf resolution was the zenith of the previous
                        era, and the vote of the Democratic Caucus inaugurates a new period.<note

                        Vietnam to escalate into such a national trauma that the result will be a
                        total paralysis of policy-making. We cannot galvanize this country into a
                        new attitude on Vietnam; we cannot afford a period of national mourning over
                        the defeat, nor can we afford to treat it as a cause for a permanent split
                        between the White House and the Congress.</p>
                    <p>The real danger is that the catharsis of Vietnam will lead to a permanent
                        coalition of domestic forces that will block policies we may <pb n="284"
                            facs="0315" xml:id="pg_284"/>have to undertake in the aftermath, and
                        that every foreign policy issue will become a partisan-political
                        confrontation.</p>
                    <p>We have to take an unqualified stand on questions of aid and on the moral
                        issues of deserting a friend, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> at the same time,
                        it is extremely important that we not transform an inevitable failure into
                        the collapse of the general design of policies that have been developed and
                        pursued since 1969.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">In sum, we have to begin limiting the damage.</hi> We must
                        be careful in our rhetoric not to exaggerate what happens in Vietnam for two
                        reasons: (1) the balance of power is not yet changed in any fundamental
                        sense, and (2) if we are bent on convincing ourselves that we have suffered
                        a monumental setback, others will almost certainly believe it.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Asian Perspective</p>
                    <p>The climax in Indochina will no doubt lead to endless analyses and debates
                        about our Asian-Pacific policy, and for now we can only set forth some
                        preliminary possibilities.</p>
                    <p>First of all, we should be careful not to overestimate the immediate
                        consequences. There is a kernel of truth to the argument about
                        self-inflicted dominoes. No doubt the other states of Asia, and particularly
                        Southeast Asia, will begin to accommodate themselves to the new realities;
                        but, in fact, each of them had already begun this process: certainly Burma,
                        Thailand, and Malaysia, and to a lesser extent Singapore, the Philippines,
                        Indonesia and Australia.</p>
                    <p>Given the attitudes in this country and the realities of our power position,
                        we should be very chary of reinforcing a series of undefined commitments,
                        simply to offset the failure in Vietnam. If we are destined for a policy of
                        more selective commitment and a redefinition of our security perimeter, then
                        we cannot be tempted into a policy of total engagement, only to face still
                        another failure.</p>
                    <p>Thus, in Thailand, if there is a move to force or ask us out, we should be
                        wary of trying to persuade the Thais to take a stand which we will not
                        support when challenged.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, we should now give major attention to some neglected
                        aspects of our policies—particularly the Philippines and Indonesia, since by
                        almost any definition these countries will play a role in our security and
                        in the balance of power in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>But the heart of our policy is still Northeast Asia: the power relationships
                        of China, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, Japan and the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In reexamining this relationship, we should bear in mind that the present
                        correlation evolved over at least the last decade, beginning with the split
                        between Peking and Moscow. Thus, it is not a transitional arrangement, but
                        one in which each of the participants arrived at their present position
                        after a careful consideration of national interests. For <pb n="285"
                            facs="0316" xml:id="pg_285"/>this reason it is reasonably stable—and
                        events in Vietnam, as such, will not be likely to disrupt it.</p>
                    <p>Of course, there will be fluctuations and nuances; one party can move
                        slightly closer to another. And there are elements of particular
                        instability, in Russian and Chinese leaderships, and the power balance of a
                        relatively weak China, which will also change over time.</p>
                    <p>In the short term—the coming decade—certain facts will prevail: the Soviet
                        Union’s power will increase enormously compared to both Japan and China;
                        ours will recede relatively, if not absolutely. Russia also has more
                        flexibility than the other actors: while maintaining a relationship with us,
                        it is quite conceivable for the Soviets either to reconcile themselves to
                        China, or opt for a Japanese axis (more likely). It is also conceivable that
                        Japan will either be forced, or decide to choose between Moscow and
                        Peking.</p>
                    <p>Our problem, therefore, is to consider how we wish the four power
                        relationship to develop: the inescapable conclusion seems to be that for the
                        next decade we will want a Sino-Japanese-American relationship arrayed
                        tacitly against the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, even though in
                        the decade that follows we may well have to choose a Soviet-American
                        coalition.</p>
                    <p>In this sense—based on an assumption that the Soviet Union will be an
                        expanding power in Asia—it also follows that we do not wish to see
                        accretions to that power, whether through links to communist movements,
                        economic ties, or political influence. It also follows that we will wish to
                        see a more normalized relationship between China and the non-communist Asian
                        countries. And, finally, we will want to involve Japan in relationships
                        outside Northeast Asia and deliverately use Japan as a means of exerting
                        indirect American influence.</p>
                    <p>In this general context two major problems arise:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">In Korea,</hi> we must find a new opportunity to define
                        our security guarantee, lest there be an inclination for the North Koreans
                        to misread our position, and emulating <persName corresp="#p_HCM_2">Ho Chi
                            Minh</persName>, use Chinese and Russian competitiveness to commit those
                        countries to a Korean adventure.</p>
                    <p>—How to manage the <hi rend="italic">Taiwan problem</hi> in the wake of
                        Vietnam? Will China be tempted to profit at our expense by hardening its
                        position, on the calculation that domestic opinion in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> will abandon Taiwan (e.g., Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName>); can we really continue a slow
                        disengagement? This may be more complicated now because the Taiwan question
                        will be read in Asia, not only as an extension of our China policy, but as
                        conveying a frame of mind in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In sum, are our security guarantees in Asia still valid, and which ones: in
                        Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, <gloss target="#t_SEATO_1"
                            >SEATO</gloss>? À la <persName corresp="#p_AD_1">Dean Acheson</persName>
                        we will be called on in the coming period to define our forward line of
                        defense. In doing so, we also will want to keep in mind we <pb n="286"
                            facs="0317" xml:id="pg_286"/>may be defining a legacy for another
                        Administration, a legacy that should contain certain well defined
                        commitments and strong points that will not be repudiated. And this means
                        more rather than less Congressional involvement in working out a
                        post-Vietnam posture in Asia.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Global Perspectives</p>
                    <p>The question of our credibility in the world cannot be dealt with in this
                        particular memorandum in any detail. It is a matter of demonstrating by our
                        behavior that we are not in headlong retreat. This will have to be applied
                        to minor issues as well as major ones. But the following problems are more
                        urgent:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">In the Middle East,</hi> we have to guard against
                        over-reacting to Israeli irresponsibility; we are in some danger of
                        persuading the Arabs that not only are we “reassessing” against Israel, but
                        that our Indochina performance suggests we will eventually abandon Israel
                        under pressure.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>:</hi>
                        Fortunately, we have reassurance of the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                            >CSCE</gloss> in the short run, and perhaps <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> in the longer term, so that our immediate problem is
                        tactical: not to be panicked into concessions, but also not to be
                        excessively intransigent simply to show our toughness of pique.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">In China,</hi> it is difficult to know what precise
                        efforts would impress Peking, and restore our credibility. Given China’s
                        obsession with a strong Western front against the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"

                        the <gloss target="#t_EEC_1">EEC</gloss> should help, but we might want to
                        reconsider <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>, as well as any unilateral
                        drawdowns of weapons under the <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                            >Schlesinger</persName> plan.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, <hi rend="italic">there is the NPT,</hi> and our drive to
                        strengthen it. Do we want to pressure Japan at this particular time; if
                        India is destined to become a nuclear power of sorts, can we insist that
                        Japan become a permanent non-nuclear power, given our own declining position
                        in Asia.</p>
                    <p>—In <hi rend="italic">South Asia,</hi> we will be confronted with Diego
                        Garcia in the Congress, and demands that we negotiate with the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, etc. We have to decide whether to take
                        a stand on this. It is a particularly important token of our policy in the
                        eyes of Peking.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vietnam</p>
                    <p>It is fruitless to speculate in this particular memorandum whether Vietnam is
                        overrun, collapses for lack of leadership and will, negotiates an
                        accommodation, or even survives through another year.</p>
                    <p>—In our policy we will have to give some new consideration to the tired,
                        semi-phony argument of Asian Titoism. It was totally erroneously applied to
                        a country that had not fulfilled its revolution, but it may have some
                        validity if there is one Vietnam.</p>
                    <pb n="287" facs="0318" xml:id="pg_287"/>
                    <p>—We have two possible interests: (1) we should encourage, as possible,
                        tensions between the Vietnamese and the Chinese, simply because we do not
                        want any basis for the revival of a communist movement spreading across
                        Asia; (2) on the other hand, we do not want the Asians to look to Moscow for
                        reassurance against Vietnamese hegemony; we should prefer that they look to
                        China. Operationally this means that we should encourage some role for
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPN_1">Sihanouk</persName>, to the degree we will
                        have any influence, and we should be prepared to deal with one Vietnam if it
                        is established.</p>
                    <p>Which brings us back to the operational problem of what our political
                        position will be in the current crisis. If it should come to negotiations,
                        what are our interests? Not to be involved at all, to become involved and
                        try to salvage what we can, or even to face the inevitability of a communist
                        dominance and work for a separate communist entity in South Vietnam? Given
                        the problems of Korea, and the insurgencies in other parts of Asia, we have
                        to be very careful not to gain the reputation for playing the honest broker
                        between communists and non-communists in Asia.</p>

                            U.S. foreign policy to a joint session of Congress at 9:04 p.m. The
                            address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television networks.
                            Earlier that evening, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            briefed several network television reporters on the content of the
                            President’s address, commenting: “We have two problems: The tragedy of
                            Vietnam and the conduct of United States’ foreign policy in the face of
                            the difficulties of Vietnam. There are two problems—the management of
                            Vietnam and keeping our foreign policy so that it is carried out with
                            design, conviction and purpose. We cannot avoid the tragedy of Vietnam
                            by denying that it has any foreign policy importance. But we can assure
                            that the basic structure and conduct of our foreign policy remain
                            strong.” He later added: “Vietnam will have an effect, but if we come
                            together, we can accomplish our goals of moving the world toward a
                            global and lasting peace. That is the philosophy and background of the
                            speech.” (<persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> Library, National

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished guests, my very
                            good friends in the Congress, and fellow Americans:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I stand before you tonight after many agonizing hours in very solemn prayers
                        for guidance by the Almighty. In my report on the state <pb n="288"
                            facs="0319" xml:id="pg_288"/>of the Union in January,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d55fn2">
                            <ref target="#d51">Document 51</ref>.</note> I concentrated on two
                        subjects which were uppermost in the minds of the American people—urgent
                        actions for the recovery of our economy and a comprehensive program to make
                        the United States independent of foreign sources of energy.</p>
                    <p>I thank the Congress for the action that it has taken thus far in my response
                            [<hi rend="italic">request</hi>?] for economic recommendations. I look
                        forward to early approval of a national energy program to meet our country’s
                        long-range and emergency needs in the field of energy.</p>
                    <p>Tonight it is my purpose to review our relations with the rest of the world
                        in the spirit of candor and consultation which I have sought to maintain
                        with my former colleagues and with our countrymen from the time that I took
                        office. It is the first priority of my Presidency to sustain and strengthen
                        the mutual trust and respect which must exist among Americans and their
                        Government if we are to deal successfully with the challenges confronting us
                        both at home and abroad.</p>
                    <p>The leadership of the United States of America since the end of World War II
                        has sustained and advanced the security, well-being, and freedom of millions
                        of human beings besides ourselves. Despite some setbacks, despite some
                        mistakes, the United States has made peace a real prospect for us and for
                        all nations. I know firsthand that the Congress has been a partner in the
                        development and in the support of American foreign policy, which five
                        Presidents before me have carried forward with changes of course but not of
                        destination.</p>
                    <p>The course which our country chooses in the world today has never been of
                        greater significance for ourselves as a nation and for all mankind. We build
                        from a solid foundation. Our alliances with great industrial democracies in
                        Europe, North America, and Japan remain strong with a greater degree of
                        consultation and equity than ever before.</p>
                    <p>With the Soviet Union we have moved across a broad front toward a more
                        stable, if still competitive, relationship. We have begun to control the
                        spiral of strategic nuclear armaments.</p>
                    <p>After two decades of mutual estrangement, we have achieved an historic
                        opening with the People’s Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>In the best American tradition, we have committed, often with striking
                        success, our influence and good offices to help contain conflicts and settle
                        disputes in many, many regions of the world. We have, for example, helped
                        the parties of the Middle East take the first steps toward living with one
                        another in peace.</p>
                    <p>We have opened a new dialog with Latin America, looking toward a healthier
                        hemispheric partnership. We are developing closer relations <pb n="289"
                            facs="0320" xml:id="pg_289"/>with the nations of Africa. We have
                        exercised international leadership on the great new issues of our
                        interdependent world, such as energy, food, environment, and the law of the
                        sea.</p>
                    <p>The American people can be proud of what their Nation has achieved and helped
                        others to accomplish, but we have from time to time suffered setbacks and
                        disappointments in foreign policy. Some were events over which we had no
                        control; some were difficulties we imposed upon ourselves.</p>
                    <p>We live in a time of testing and of a time of change. Our world—a world of
                        economic uncertainty, political unrest, and threats to the peace—does not
                        allow us the luxury of abdication or domestic discord.</p>
                    <p>I recall quite vividly the words of President <persName corresp="#p_THS_1"
                            >Truman</persName> to the Congress when the United States faced a far
                        greater challenge at the end of the Second World War. If I might quote: “If
                        we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world, and we
                        shall surely endanger the welfare of this Nation.”</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName>’s resolution must
                        guide us today. Our purpose is not to point the finger of blame, but to
                        build upon our many successes, to repair damage where we find it, to recover
                        our balance, to move ahead as a united people. Tonight is a time for
                        straight talk among friends, about where we stand and where we are
                        going.</p>
                    <p>A vast human tragedy has befallen our friends in Vietnam and Cambodia.
                        Tonight I shall not talk only of obligations arising from legal documents.
                        Who can forget the enormous sacrifices of blood, dedication, and treasure
                        that we made in Vietnam?</p>
                    <p>Under five Presidents and 12 Congresses, the United States was engaged in
                        Indochina. Millions of Americans served, thousands died, and many more were
                        wounded, imprisoned, or lost. Over $150 billion have been appropriated for
                        that war by the Congress of the United States. And after years of effort, we
                        negotiated, under the most difficult circumstances, a settlement which made
                        it possible for us to remove our military forces and bring home with pride
                        our American prisoners.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">See <ref target="#d1fn3"
                                >footnote 3, Document 1</ref>.</note> This settlement, if its terms
                        had been adhered to, would have permitted our South Vietnamese ally, with
                        our material and moral support, to maintain its security and rebuild after
                        two decades of war.</p>
                    <p>The chances for an enduring peace after the last American fighting man left
                        Vietnam in 1973 rested on two publicly stated premises: first, that if
                        necessary, the United States would help sustain the terms of the Paris
                        accords it signed 2 years ago, and second, that the United States would
                        provide adequate economic and military assistance to South Vietnam.</p>
                    <pb n="290" facs="0321" xml:id="pg_290"/>
                    <p>Let us refresh our memories for just a moment. The universal consensus in the
                        United States at that time, late 1972, was that if we could end our own
                        involvement and obtain the release of our prisoners, we would provide
                        adequate material support to South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese, from the
                        moment they signed the Paris accords, systematically violated the cease-fire
                        and other provisions of that agreement. Flagrantly disregarding the ban on
                        the infiltration of troops, the North Vietnamese illegally introduced over
                        350,000 men into the South. In direct violation of the agreement, they sent
                        in the most modern equipment in massive amounts. Meanwhile, they continued
                        to receive large quantities of supplies and arms from their friends.</p>
                    <p>In the face of this situation, the United States—torn as it was by the
                        emotions of a decade of war—was unable to respond. We deprived ourselves by
                        law of the ability to enforce the agreement, thus giving North Vietnam
                        assurance that it could violate that agreement with impunity. Next, we
                        reduced our economic and arms aid to South Vietnam. Finally, we signaled our
                        increasing reluctance to give any support to that nation struggling for its
                        survival.</p>
                    <p>Encouraged by these developments, the North Vietnamese, in recent months,
                        began sending even their reserve divisions into South Vietnam. Some 20
                        divisions, virtually their entire army, are now in South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The Government of South Vietnam, uncertain of further American assistance,
                        hastily ordered a strategic withdrawal to more defensible positions. This
                        extremely difficult maneuver, decided upon without consultations, was poorly
                        executed, hampered by floods of refugees, and thus led to panic. The results
                        are painfully obvious and profoundly moving.</p>
                    <p>In my first public comment on this tragic development,<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d55fn4">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName>’s remarks at the White House Conference on Domestic
                            and Economic Affairs, held in San Diego on April 3. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> commented: “As it always has,
                            adversity is creating a new sense of national unity among Americans in
                            these sad and troubled times. I will not engage in recriminations or
                            attempts to assess the blame, nor should any of us. Not all of the facts
                            are known. When they are, the American people will be the jury for the
                            present and historians will write the story for the future. What is
                            essential now is that we keep our nerve and our essential unity as a
                            powerful but peace-loving nation.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers:

                    <p>In the same spirit, I welcome the statement of the distinguished majority
                        leader of the United States Senate earlier this week, and I quote: “It is
                        time for the Congress and the President to work together in the area of
                        foreign as well as domestic policy.”</p>
                    <p>So, let us start afresh.</p>
                    <pb n="291" facs="0322" xml:id="pg_291"/>
                    <p>I am here to work with the Congress. In the conduct of foreign affairs,
                        Presidential initiative and ability to act swiftly in emergencies are
                        essential to our national interest.</p>
                    <p>With respect to North Vietnam, I call upon Hanoi—and ask the Congress to join
                        with me in this call—to cease military operations immediately and to honor
                        the terms of the Paris agreement.</p>
                    <p>The United States is urgently requesting the signatories of the Paris
                        conference to meet their obligations to use their influence to halt the
                        fighting and to enforce the 1973 accords. Diplomatic notes to this effect
                        have been sent to all members of the Paris conference, including the Soviet
                        Union and the People’s Republic of China.<note n="5" xml:id="d55fn5">The

                    </p>
                    <p>The situation in South Vietnam and Cambodia has reached a critical phase
                        requiring immediate and positive decisions by this Government. The options
                        before us are few and the time is very short.</p>
                    <p>On the one hand, the United States could do nothing more; let the Government
                        of South Vietnam save itself and what is left of its territory, if it can;
                        let those South Vietnamese civilians who have worked with us for a decade or
                        more save their lives and their families, if they can; in short, shut our
                        eyes and wash our hands of the whole affair—if we can.</p>
                    <p>Or, on the other hand, I could ask the Congress for authority to enforce the
                        Paris accords with our troops and our tanks and our aircraft and our
                        artillery and carry the war to the enemy.</p>
                    <p>There are two narrower options:</p>
                    <p>First, stick with my January request that Congress appropriate $300 million
                        for military assistance for South Vietnam and seek additional funds for
                        economic and humanitarian purposes.<note n="6" xml:id="d55fn6">See <ref
                                target="#d52fn2">footnote 2, Document 52</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Or, increase my requests for both emergency military and humanitarian
                        assistance to levels which, by best estimates, might enable the South
                        Vietnamese to stem the onrushing aggression, to stabilize the military
                        situation, permit the chance of a negotiated political settlement between
                        the North and South Vietnamese, and if the very worst were to happen, at
                        least allow the orderly evacuation of Americans and endangered South
                        Vietnamese to places of safety.</p>
                    <p>Let me now state my considerations and my conclusions.</p>
                    <pb n="292" facs="0323" xml:id="pg_292"/>
                    <p>I have received a full report from General <persName corresp="#p_WFC_1"
                            >Weyand</persName>,<note n="7" xml:id="d55fn7">General <persName

                        to assess the situation. He advises that the current military situation is
                        very critical, but that South Vietnam is continuing to defend itself with
                        the resources available. However, he feels that if there is to be any chance
                        of success for their defense plan, South Vietnam needs urgently an
                        additional $722 million in very specific military supplies from the United
                        States. In my judgment, a stabilization of the military situation offers the
                        best opportunity for a political solution.</p>
                    <p>I must, of course, as I think each of you would, consider the safety of
                        nearly 6,000 Americans who remain in South Vietnam and tens of thousands of
                        South Vietnamese employees of the United States Government, of news
                        agencies, of contractors and businesses for many years whose lives, with
                        their dependents, are in very grave peril. There are tens of thousands of
                        other South Vietnamese intellectuals, professors, teachers, editors, and
                        opinion leaders who have supported the South Vietnamese cause and the
                        alliance with the United States to whom we have a profound moral
                        obligation.</p>
                    <p>I am also mindful of our posture toward the rest of the world and,
                        particularly, of our future relations with the free nations of Asia. These
                        nations must not think for a minute that the United States is pulling out on
                        them or intends to abandon them to aggression.</p>
                    <p>I have therefore concluded that the national interests of the United States
                        and the cause of world stability require that we continue to give both
                        military and humanitarian assistance to the South Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>Assistance to South Vietnam at this stage must be swift and adequate. Drift
                        and indecision invite far deeper disaster. The sums I had requested before
                        the major North Vietnamese offensive and the sudden South Vietnamese retreat
                        are obviously inadequate. Half-hearted action would be worse than none. We
                        must act together and act decisively.</p>
                    <p>I am therefore asking the Congress to appropriate without delay $722 million
                        for emergency military assistance and an initial sum of $250 million for
                        economic and humanitarian aid for South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The situation in South Vietnam is changing very rapidly, and the need for
                        emergency food, medicine, and refugee relief is growing by the hour. I will
                        work with the Congress in the days ahead to develop humanitarian assistance
                        to meet these very pressing needs.</p>
                    <p>Fundamental decency requires that we do everything in our power to ease the
                        misery and the pain of the monumental human crisis which has befallen the
                        people of Vietnam. Millions have fled in the face <pb n="293" facs="0324"
                            xml:id="pg_293"/>of the Communist onslaught and are now homeless and are
                        now destitute. I hereby pledge in the name of the American people that the
                        United States will make a maximum humanitarian effort to help care for and
                        feed these hopeless victims.</p>
                    <p>And now I ask the Congress to clarify immediately its restrictions on the use
                        of U.S. military forces in Southeast Asia for the limited purposes of
                        protecting American lives by ensuring their evacuation, if this should be
                        necessary. And I also ask prompt revision of the law to cover those
                        Vietnamese to whom we have a very special obligation and whose lives may be
                        endangered should the worst come to pass.</p>
                    <p>I hope that this authority will never have to be used, but if it is needed,
                        there will be no time for Congressional debate. Because of the gravity of
                        the situation, I ask the Congress to complete action on all of these
                        measures not later than April 19.</p>
                    <p>In Cambodia, the situation is tragic. The United States and the Cambodian
                        Government have each made major efforts, over a long period and through many
                        channels, to end that conflict. But because of their military successes,
                        steady external support, and their awareness of American legal restrictions,
                        the Communist side has shown no interest in negotiation, compromise, or a
                        political solution. And yet, for the past 3 months, the beleaguered people
                        of Phnom Penh have fought on, hoping against hope that the United States
                        would not desert them, but instead provide the arms and ammunition they so
                        badly needed.</p>
                    <p>I have received a moving letter from the new acting President of Cambodia,
                            <persName corresp="#p_SK_1">Saukham Khoy</persName>, and let me quote it
                        for you:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. President,” he wrote, “As the American Congress reconvenes to
                        reconsider your urgent request for supplemental assistance for the Khmer
                        Republic, I appeal to you to convey to the American legislators our plea not
                        to deny these vital resources to us, if a nonmilitary solution is to emerge
                        from this tragic 5-year-old conflict.</p>
                    <p>“To find a peaceful end to the conflict we need time. I do not know how much
                        time, but we all fully realize that the agony of the Khmer people cannot and
                        must not go on much longer. However, for the immediate future, we need the
                        rice to feed the hungry and the ammunition and the weapons to defend
                        ourselves against those who want to impose their will by force [of
                            arms].<note n="8" xml:id="d55fn8">Brackets are in the original.</note> A
                        denial by the American people of the means for us to carry on will leave us
                        no alternative but inevitably abandoning our search for a solution which
                        will give our citizens some freedom of choice as to their future. For a
                        number of years now the Cambodian people have placed their trust in America.
                        I cannot believe that this confidence was misplaced and that suddenly
                        America <pb n="294" facs="0325" xml:id="pg_294"/>will deny us the means
                        which might give us a chance to find an acceptable solution to our
                        conflict.”</p>
                    <p>This letter speaks for itself. In January, I requested food and ammunition
                        for the brave Cambodians, and I regret to say that as of this evening, it
                        may be soon too late.<note n="9" xml:id="d55fn9">On April 11, Khmer Rouge
                            troops entered Phnom Penh. In advance of such action, the United States
                            instituted its evacuation plan, Operation Eagle Pull, to remove Embassy
                            personnel and top Cambodian officials from Phnom Penh. Although the
                            United States planned to evacuate close to 300 Cambodians, the final

                    </p>
                    <p>Members of the Congress, my fellow Americans, this moment of tragedy for
                        Indochina is a time of trial for us. It is a time for national resolve.</p>
                    <p>It has been said that the United States is over-extended, that we have too
                        many commitments too far from home, that we must reexamine what our truly
                        vital interests are and shape our strategy to conform to them. I find no
                        fault with this as a theory, but in the real world such a course must be
                        pursued carefully and in close coordination with solid progress toward
                        overall reduction in worldwide tensions.</p>
                    <p>We cannot, in the meantime, abandon our friends while our adversaries support
                        and encourage theirs. We cannot dismantle our defenses, our diplomacy, or
                        our intelligence capability while others increase and strengthen theirs.</p>
                    <p>Let us put an end to self-inflicted wounds. Let us remember that our national
                        unity is a most priceless asset. Let us deny our adversaries the
                        satisfaction of using Vietnam to pit Americans against Americans. At this
                        moment, the United States must present to the world a united front.</p>
                    <p>Above all, let’s keep events in Southeast Asia in their proper perspective.
                        The security and the progress of hundreds of millions of people everywhere
                        depend importantly on us.</p>
                    <p>Let no potential adversary believe that our difficulties or our debates mean
                        a slackening of our national will. We will stand by our friends, we will
                        honor our commitments, and we will uphold our country’s principles.</p>
                    <p>The American people know that our strength, our authority, and our leadership
                        have helped prevent a third world war for more than a generation. We will
                        not shrink from this duty in the decades ahead.</p>
                    <p>Let me now review with you the basic elements of our foreign policy, speaking
                        candidly about our strengths and some of our difficulties.</p>
                    <pb n="295" facs="0326" xml:id="pg_295"/>
                    <p>We must, first of all, face the fact that what has happened in Indochina has
                        disquieted many of our friends, especially in Asia. We must deal with this
                        situation promptly and firmly. To this end, I have already scheduled
                        meetings with the leaders of Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and
                        Indonesia, and I expect to meet with the leaders of other Asian countries as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>A key country in this respect is Japan. The warm welcome I received in Japan
                        last November<note n="10" xml:id="d55fn10">
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> visited Japan, South Korea,
                            and the Soviet Union November 17–24, 1974.</note> vividly symbolized for
                        both our peoples the friendship and the solidarity of this extraordinary
                        partnership. I look forward, as I am sure all of you do, with very special
                        pleasure to welcoming the Emperor when he visits the United States later
                        this year.</p>
                    <p>We consider our security treaty with Japan the cornerstone of stability in
                        the vast reaches of Asia and the Pacific. Our relations are crucial to our
                        mutual well-being. Together, we are working energetically on the
                        international multilateral agenda—in trade, energy, and food. We will
                        continue the process of strengthening our friendship, mutual security, and
                        prosperity.</p>
                    <p>Also, of course, of fundamental importance is our mutual security
                        relationship with the Republic of Korea, which I reaffirmed on my recent
                        visit.</p>
                    <p>Our relations with Europe have never been stronger. There are no peoples with
                        whom America’s destiny has been more closely linked. There are no peoples
                        whose friendship and cooperation are more needed for the future. For none of
                        the members of the Atlantic community can be secure, none can prosper, none
                        can advance unless we all do so together. More than ever, these times demand
                        our close collaboration in order to maintain the secure anchor of our common
                        security in this time of international riptides, to work together on the
                        promising negotiations with our potential adversaries, to pool our energies
                        on the great new economic challenge that faces us.</p>
                    <p>In addition to this traditional agenda, there are new problems involving
                        energy, raw materials, and the environment. The Atlantic nations face many
                        and complex negotiations and decisions. It is time to take stock, to consult
                        on our future, to affirm once again our cohesion and our common destiny. I
                        therefore expect to join with the other leaders of the Atlantic Alliance at
                        a Western summit in the very near future.<note n="11" xml:id="d55fn11">

                    <p>Before this <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> meeting, I earnestly ask
                        the Congress to weigh the broader considerations and consequences of its
                        past actions on the complex Greek-Turkish dispute over Cyprus.<note n="12"
                            xml:id="d55fn12">See <ref target="#d52fn4">footnote 4, Document
                            52</ref>.</note> Our foreign policy cannot be simply a collection of
                        special economic or ethnic or ideological interests. There must be a deep
                        concern for the overall design of our international actions. To achieve this
                        design for peace and to assure that our individual acts have some coherence,
                        the Executive must have some flexibility in the conduct of foreign
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>United States military assistance to an old and faithful ally, Turkey, has
                        been cut off by action of the Congress. This has imposed an embargo on
                        military purchases by Turkey, extending even to items already paid for—an
                        unprecedented act against a friend.</p>
                    <p>These moves, I know, were sincerely intended to influence Turkey in the
                        Cyprus negotiations. I deeply share the concern of many citizens for the
                        immense human suffering on Cyprus. I sympathize with the new democratic
                        government in Greece. We are continuing our earnest efforts to find
                        equitable solutions to the problems which exist between Greece and Turkey.
                        But the result of the Congressional action has been to block progress
                        towards reconciliation, thereby prolonging the suffering on Cyprus, to
                        complicate our ability to promote successful negotiations, to increase the
                        danger of a broader conflict.</p>
                    <p>Our longstanding relationship with Turkey is not simply a favor to Turkey; it
                        is a clear and essential mutual interest. Turkey lies on the rim of the
                        Soviet Union and at the gates of the Middle East. It is vital to the
                        security of the eastern Mediterranean, the southern flank of Western Europe,
                        and the collective security of the Western alliance. Our U.S. military bases
                        in Turkey are as critical to our own security as they are to the defense of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I therefore call upon the Congress to lift the American arms embargo against
                        our Turkish ally by passing the bipartisan <persName corresp="#p_MMJ_1"

                        Senate. Only this will enable us to work with Greece and Turkey to resolve
                        the differences between our allies. I accept and indeed welcome the bill’s
                        requirement for monthly reports to the Congress on progress toward a Cyprus
                        settlement, but unless this is done with dispatch, forces may be set in
                        motion within and between the two nations which could not be reversed.</p>

                    <p>At the same time, in order to strengthen the democratic government of Greece
                        and to reaffirm our traditional ties with the people of Greece, we are
                        actively discussing a program of economic and military assistance with them.
                        We will shortly be submitting specific requests to the Congress in this
                        regard.</p>
                    <p>A vital element of our foreign policy is our relationship with the developing
                        countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These countries must know that
                        America is a true, that America is a concerned friend, reliable both in word
                        and deed.</p>
                    <p>As evidence of this friendship, I urge the Congress to reconsider one
                        provision of the 1974 trade act<note n="14" xml:id="d55fn14">See <ref
                                target="#d31">Document 31</ref>.</note> which has had an unfortunate
                        and unintended impact on our relations with Latin America, where we have
                        such a long tie of friendship and cooperation. Under this legislation, all
                        members of <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> were excluded from our
                        generalized system of trade preferences. This, unfortunately, punished two
                        South American friends, Ecuador and Venezuela, as well as other <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> nations, such as Nigeria and Indonesia,
                        none of which participated in last year’s oil embargo. This exclusion has
                        seriously complicated our new dialog with our friends in this hemisphere. I
                        therefore endorse the amendments which have been introduced in the Congress
                        to provide executive authority to waive those restrictions on the trade act
                        that are incompatible with our national interest.</p>
                    <p>The interests of America as well as our allies are vitally affected by what
                        happens in the Middle East. So long as the state of tension continues, it
                        threatens military crisis, the weakening of our alliances, the stability of
                        the world economy, and confrontation with the nuclear super powers. These
                        are intolerable risks.</p>
                    <p>Because we are in the unique position of being able to deal with all the
                        parties, we have, at their request, been engaged for the past year and a
                        half in the peacemaking effort unparalleled in the history of the region.
                        Our policy has brought remarkable successes on the road to peace. Last year,
                        two major disengagement agreements were negotiated and implemented with our
                            help.<note n="15" xml:id="d55fn15">
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> was referring to the
                            Egyptian-Israeli disengagement agreement of January 18, 1974, and the
                            Syrian-Israeli disengagement agreement of May 31, 1974.</note> For the
                        first time in 30 years, a process of negotiation on the basic political
                        issues was begun and is continuing.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the latest efforts to reach a further interim agreement
                        between Israel and Egypt have been suspended. The issues dividing the
                        parties are vital to them and not amenable to easy and to quick solutions.
                        However, the United States will not be discouraged.</p>
                    <pb n="298" facs="0329" xml:id="pg_298"/>
                    <p>The momentum toward peace that has been achieved over the last 18 months must
                        and will be maintained. The active role of the United States must and will
                        be continued. The drift toward war must and will be prevented.</p>
                    <p>I pledge the United States to a major effort for peace in the Middle East, an
                        effort which I know has the solid support of the American people and their
                        Congress. We are now examining how best to proceed. We have agreed in
                        principle to reconvene the Geneva conference. We are prepared as well to
                        explore other forums. The United States will move ahead on whatever course
                        looks most promising, either towards an overall settlement or interim
                        agreements, should the parties themselves desire them. We will not accept
                        stagnation or stalemate with all its attendant risks to peace and prosperity
                        and to our relations in and outside of the region.</p>
                    <p>The national interest and national security require as well that we reduce
                        the dangers of war. We shall strive to do so by continuing to improve our
                        relations with potential adversaries.</p>
                    <p>The United States and the Soviet Union share an interest in lessening
                        tensions and building a more stable relationship. During this process, we
                        have never had any illusions. We know that we are dealing with a nation that
                        reflects different principles and is our competitor in many parts of the
                        globe. Through a combination of firmness and flexibility, the United States,
                        in recent years, laid the basis of a more reliable relationship, founded on
                        mutual interest and mutual restraint. But we cannot expect the Soviet Union
                        to show restraint in the face of the United States’ weakness or
                        irresolution.</p>
                    <p>As long as I am President, America will maintain its strength, its alliances,
                        and its principles as a prerequisite to a more peaceful planet. As long as I
                        am President, we will not permit détente to become a license to fish in
                        troubled waters. Détente must be—and, I trust, will be—a two-way
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>Central to U.S.-Soviet relations today is the critical negotiation to control
                        strategic nuclear weapons. We hope to turn the Vladivostok agreements<note
                            n="16" xml:id="d55fn16">See <ref target="#d48fn6">footnote 6, Document
                                48</ref>.</note> into a final agreement this year at the time of
                        General Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s visit
                        to the United States. Such an agreement would, for the first time, put a
                        ceiling on the strategic arms race. It would mark a turning point in postwar
                        history and would be a crucial step in lifting from mankind the threat of
                        nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>Our use of trade and economic sanctions as weapons to alter the internal
                        conduct of other nations must also be seriously reexamined. However
                        well-intentioned the goals, the fact is that some of our recent <pb n="299"
                            facs="0330" xml:id="pg_299"/>actions in the economic field have been
                        self-defeating, they are not achieving the objectives intended by the
                        Congress, and they have damaged our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits most-favored-nation treatment, credit and
                        investment guarantees and commercial agreements with the Soviet Union so
                        long as their emigration policies fail to meet our criteria. The Soviet
                        Union has therefore refused to put into effect the important 1972 trade
                        agreement between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>As a result, Western Europe and Japan have stepped into the breach. Those
                        countries have extended credits to the Soviet Union exceeding $8 billion in
                        the last 6 months. These are economic opportunities, jobs, and business
                        which could have gone to Americans.</p>
                    <p>There should be no illusions about the nature of the Soviet system, but there
                        should be no illusions about how to deal with it. Our belief in the right of
                        peoples of the world freely to emigrate has been well demonstrated. This
                        legislation, however, not only harmed our relations with the Soviet Union
                        but seriously complicated the prospects of those seeking to emigrate. The
                        favorable trend, aided by quiet diplomacy, by which emigration increased
                        from 400 in 1968 to over 33,000 in 1973 has been seriously set back.
                        Remedial legislation is urgently needed in our national interest.</p>
                    <p>With the People’s Republic of China, we are firmly fixed on the course set
                        forth in the Shanghai communiqué.<note n="17" xml:id="d55fn17">See <ref

                        Asia and the world require our constructive relations with one-fourth of the
                        human race. After two decades of mutual isolation and hostility, we have, in
                        recent years, built a promising foundation. Deep differences in our
                        philosophy and social systems will endure, but so should our mutual
                        long-term interests and the goals to which our countries have jointly
                        subscribed in Shanghai. I will visit China later this year to reaffirm these
                        interests and to accelerate the improvement in our relations. And I was glad
                        to welcome the distinguished Speaker and the distinguished minority leader
                        of the House back today from their constructive visit to the People’s
                        Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>Let me talk about new challenges. The issues I have discussed are the most
                        pressing of the traditional agenda on foreign policy, but ahead of us also
                        is a vast new agenda of issues in an interdependent world. The United
                        States, with its economic power, its technology, its zest for new horizons,
                        is the acknowledged world leader in dealing with many of these
                        challenges.</p>
                    <p>If this is a moment of uncertainty in the world, it is even more a moment of
                        rare opportunity.</p>
                    <pb n="300" facs="0331" xml:id="pg_300"/>
                    <p>We are summoned to meet one of man’s most basic challenges—hunger. At the
                        World Food Conference last November in Rome, the United States outlined a
                        comprehensive program to close the ominous gap between population growth and
                        food production over the long term.<note n="18" xml:id="d55fn18">See <ref
                                target="#d47">Document 47</ref>.</note> Our technological skill and
                        our enormous productive capacity are crucial to accomplishing this task.</p>
                    <p>The old order—in trade, finance, and raw materials—is changing and American
                        leadership is needed in the creation of new institutions and practices for
                        worldwide prosperity and progress.</p>
                    <p>The world’s oceans, with their immense resources and strategic importance,
                        must become areas of cooperation rather than conflict. American policy is
                        directed to that end.</p>
                    <p>Technology must be harnessed to the service of mankind while protecting the
                        environment. This, too, is an arena for American leadership.</p>
                    <p>The interests and the aspirations of the developed and developing nations
                        must be reconciled in a manner that is both realistic and humane. This is
                        our goal in this new era.</p>
                    <p>One of the finest success stories in our foreign policy is our cooperative
                        effort with other major energy-consuming nations. In little more than a
                        year, together with our partners, we have created the International Energy
                        Agency; we have negotiated an emergency sharing arrangement which helps to
                        reduce the dangers of an embargo; we have launched major international
                        conservation efforts; we have developed a massive program for the
                        development of alternative sources of energy.</p>
                    <p>But the fate of all of these programs depends crucially on what we do at
                        home. Every month that passes brings us closer to the day when we will be
                        dependent on imported energy for 50 percent of our requirements. A new
                        embargo under these conditions could have a devastating impact on jobs,
                        industrial expansion, and inflation at home. Our economy cannot be left to
                        the mercy of decisions over which we have no control. And I call upon the
                        Congress to act affirmatively.</p>
                    <p>In a world where information is power, a vital element of our national
                        security lies in our intelligence services. They are essential to our
                        Nation’s security in peace as in war. Americans can be grateful for the
                        important but largely unsung contributions and achievements of the
                        intelligence services of this Nation.</p>
                    <p>It is entirely proper that this system be subject to Congressional review.
                        But a sensationalized public debate over legitimate intelligence <pb n="301"
                            facs="0332" xml:id="pg_301"/>activities is a disservice to this Nation
                        and a threat to our intelligence system. It ties our hands while our
                        potential enemies operate with secrecy, with skill, and with vast resources.
                        Any investigation must be conducted with maximum discretion and dispatch to
                        avoid crippling a vital national institution.</p>
                    <p>Let me speak quite frankly to some in this Chamber and perhaps to some not in
                        this Chamber. The Central Intelligence Agency has been of maximum importance
                        to Presidents before me. The Central Intelligence Agency has been of maximum
                        importance to me. The Central Intelligence Agency and its associated
                        intelligence organizations could be of maximum importance to some of you in
                        this audience who might be President at some later date. I think it would be
                        catastrophic for the Congress or anyone else to destroy the usefulness by
                        dismantling, in effect, our intelligence systems upon which we rest so
                        heavily.</p>
                    <p>Now, as Congress oversees intelligence activities, it must, of course,
                        organize itself to do so in a responsible way. It has been traditional for
                        the Executive to consult with the Congress through specially protected
                        procedures that safeguard essential secrets. But recently, some of those
                        procedures have altered in a way that makes the protection of vital
                        information very, very difficult. I will say to the leaders of the Congress,
                        the House and the Senate, that I will work with them to devise procedures
                        which will meet the needs of the Congress for review of intelligence agency
                        activities and the needs of the Nation for an effective intelligence
                        service.</p>
                    <p>Underlying any successful foreign policy is the strength and the credibility
                        of our defense posture. We are strong and we are ready and we intend to
                        remain so. Improvement of relations with adversaries does not mean any
                        relaxation of our national vigilance. On the contrary, it is the firm
                        maintenance of both strength and vigilance that makes possible steady
                        progress toward a safer and a more peaceful world.</p>
                    <p>The national security budget that I have submitted is the minimum the United
                        States needs in this critical hour.<note n="19" xml:id="d55fn19">President

                            The section of his transmittal message concerning national security
                            begins: “The ultimate goal of American foreign policy is to ensure the
                            freedom, security, and well-being of the United States as part of a
                            peaceful and properous international community.” For the full text of

                        will. But it is my considered judgment that any significant reduction,
                        revision, would endanger our national security and thus jeopardize the
                        peace.</p>

                    <p>Let no ally doubt our determination to maintain a defense second to none, and
                        let no adversary be tempted to test our readiness or our resolve.</p>
                    <p>History is testing us today. We cannot afford indecision, disunity, or
                        disarray in the conduct of our foreign affairs. You and I can resolve here
                        and now that this Nation shall move ahead with wisdom, with assurance, and
                        with national unity.</p>
                    <p>The world looks to us for the vigor and for the vision that we have
                        demonstrated so often in the past in great moments of our national history.
                        And as I look down the road, I see a confident America, secure in its
                        strengths, secure in its values, and determined to maintain both. I see a
                        conciliatory America, extending its hand to allies and adversaries alike,
                        forming bonds of cooperation to deal with the vast problems facing us all. I
                        see a compassionate America, its heart reaching out to orphans, to refugees,
                        and to our fellow human beings afflicted by war, by tyranny, and by
                        hunger.</p>
                    <p>As President, entrusted by the Constitution with primary responsibility for
                        the conduct of our foreign affairs, I renew the pledge I made last August to
                        work cooperatively with the Congress.<note n="20" xml:id="d55fn20">See <ref
                                target="#d41">Document 41</ref>.</note> I ask that the Congress help
                        to keep America’s word good throughout the world. We are one Nation, one
                        government, and we must have one foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>In an hour far darker than this, Abraham Lincoln told his fellow citizens,
                        and I quote: “We cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this
                        Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal
                        significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us.”</p>
                    <p>We who are entrusted by the people with the great decisions that fashion
                        their future can escape neither responsibilities nor our consciences. By
                        what we do now, the world will know our courage, our constancy, and our
                        compassion.</p>
                    <p>The spirit of America is good and the heart of America is strong. Let us be
                        proud of what we have done and confident of what we can do.</p>
                    <p>And may God ever guide us to do what is right.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>’s speech.
                            According to a published description: “Much of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>’s speech was devoted to
                            what seemed to be a history lesson for listeners overseas. He traced the
                            oscillations of American feeling about overseas involvement from the
                            Spanish-American War until the present, pointing out that public opinion
                            had swung from enthusiastic physical participation in world affairs to
                            such ‘high-flown moral’ commitments as the Kellogg-Briand pact of the
                            twenties.” (“U.S. to Honor Pacts, <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                                >Schlesinger</persName> Says,” <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Times</hi>, April 16, 1975, p. 19)</note> His purpose in the speech—“to
                        discuss the historic ebb and flow of American sentiment regarding the proper
                        role and responsibility of the United States in international affairs”—takes
                        some interesting twists. At the outset <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                            >Schlesinger</persName> refers to the current slump through which the
                        American society is passing and expresses the hope for a rapid transition
                        through it in order to recover “. . . internal health and cohesion” as well
                        as to continue “the American impact on the stability, security and
                        well-being of other free states around the world.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> states further that “there is
                        no acceptable alternative to deep and steady American support of and
                        participation in the security of other free states.” In the latter context
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> then focuses on
                        Vietnam and states that while the outcome of the current struggle remains in
                        doubt, “the Vietnamese deserve not only our hope for their success but our
                        continued support.” <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> then
                        addresses Vietnam as a notable example of “the historic misunderstanding
                        regarding the necessary role that force plays in the settlement of
                        international disputes, on the one hand, and the role of noble intentions
                        supported by moralizing but unsupported by physical force on the other.” He
                        refers to the history of North Vietnamese violations of the Paris Accords as
                        “an object lesson regarding how much constraint on the actions of at least
                        one Communist state such pledged treaty obligations have when the force
                        balance becomes unfavorable.” <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                            >Schlesinger</persName> does not, however, carry the point forward to
                        define whether the responsibility for not using the necessary force was
                        rooted in the faulty <pb n="304" facs="0335" xml:id="pg_304"/>premise of
                        détente, which he implies, or elsewhere, i.e. legislative restriction.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> then turns to a rather
                        sophomoric treatment of the cycle of American sentiment toward foreign
                        policy as between moralistic enthusiasm and disenchanted isolationism. In
                        the process, he includes the hypocritical but soul salving statement that
                        “American society . . . is for a democracy, remarkably tenacious of purpose,
                        as I think the overall history of the war in Southeast Asia would indicate.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> then warms to his
                        subject, however, by asking rhetorically where this historical cycle leaves
                        us today. Keeping his remarks in the abstract, he states that “that
                        admixture of idealism and disenchantment has historically resulted in a
                        quest for novelty in foreign policy. But in foreign policy novelty is not
                        available. Given the underlying realities of the single strategic stage on
                        which world politics is now played, the United States will be obliged either
                        to support its more or less permanent interests (by essentially military
                        means) or withdraw into the North American continent. There are matters of
                        degree, of course, but . . . there are no novelties suddenly to be
                        discovered.” (Parenthetical comment added by <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1"
                            >Scowcroft</persName>.) <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                            >Schlesinger</persName> then cites <persName corresp="#p_KGF_1">George
                            Kennan</persName>’s statement of the fundamental necessity that no

                            n="3" xml:id="d56fn3">Presumably a reference to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KGF_1">Kennan</persName>’s “The Sources of Soviet
                            Conduct,” published in the July 1947 issue of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                Affairs</hi> under the pseudonym “X.”</note> as a pragmatic guide to
                        overall policy and as explaining “why no novel discoveries will suddenly
                        eliminate the continuing responsibility of the United States as the mainstay
                        and cohesive force among free nations,” and further with regard to U.S.
                        forces in Europe that “there is no novel way in which those forces can be
                        withdrawn and the military balance in Europe be preserved.” He then goes on
                        to focus upon the essentiality of maintaining the U.S. commitment to <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, Japan, and Korea with whom we have
                        treaty commitments (no reference to the Philippines, the <gloss
                            target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1"
                            >CENTO</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>My remarks may be too severe. The speech may be read as a call for a strong
                        national defense and nothing more. I believe, however, that there are enough
                        rationalizations on Vietnam and exclusive references to wherein the United
                        States’ interests really lie to present a disquieting statement to many of
                        our allies by an official who ought to know better. Moreover, <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>’s repeated references to the
                        search for “novelties” in foreign policy is a scarcely veiled reference to
                        détente. His fundamental distortion of the concept is bad enough. When
                        viewed in the context of his own actions, e.g. to unilaterally withdraw
                        warheads from Europe and general purpose forces from many other locations,
                        it becomes downright disgusting.</p>

                        it cannot be achieved by refighting a war that is finished as far as America

                            Wind—commenced on April 29.</note> As I see it, the time has come to
                        look forward to an agenda for the future, to unify, to bind up the Nation’s
                        wounds, and to restore its health and its optimistic self-confidence.</p>
                    <p>In New Orleans, a great battle was fought after a war was over. In New
                        Orleans tonight, we can begin a great national reconciliation. The first
                        engagement must be with the problems of today, but just as importantly, the
                        problems of the future. That is why I think it is so appropriate that I find
                        myself tonight at a university which addresses itself to preparing young
                        people for the challenge of tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>I ask that we stop refighting the battles and the recriminations of the past.
                        I ask that we look now at what is right with America, at our possibilities
                        and our potentialities for change and growth and achievement and sharing. I
                        ask that we accept the responsibilities of leadership as a good neighbor to
                        all peoples and the enemy of none. I ask that we strive to become, in the
                        finest American tradition, something more tomorrow than we are today.</p>
                    <p>Instead of my addressing the image of America, I prefer to consider the
                        reality of America. It is true that we have launched our Bicentennial
                        celebration without having achieved human perfection, but we have attained a
                        very remarkable self-governed society that possesses the flexibility and the
                        dynamism to grow and undertake an entirely new agenda, an agenda for
                        America’s third century.</p>
                    <p>So, I ask you to join me in helping to write that agenda. I am as determined
                        as a President can be to seek national rediscovery of the belief in
                        ourselves that characterized the most creative periods in our Nation’s
                        history. The greatest challenge of creativity, as I see it, lies ahead.</p>
                    <pb n="306" facs="0337" xml:id="pg_306"/>
                    <p>We, of course, are saddened indeed by the events in Indochina. But these
                        events, tragic as they are, portend neither the end of the world nor of
                        America’s leadership in the world.</p>
                    <p>Let me put it this way, if I might. Some tend to feel that if we do not
                        succeed in everything everywhere, then we have succeeded in nothing
                        anywhere. I reject categorically such polarized thinking. We can and we
                        should help others to help themselves. But the fate of responsible men and
                        women everywhere, in the final decision, rests in their own hands, not in
                        ours.</p>
                    <p>America’s future depends upon Americans—especially your generation, which is
                        now equipping itself to assume the challenges of the future, to help write
                        the agenda for America.</p>
                    <p>Earlier today, in this great community, I spoke about the need to maintain
                        our defenses.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">

                            562–567.</note> Tonight, I would like to talk about another kind of
                        strength, the true source of American power that transcends all of the
                        deterrent powers for peace of our Armed Forces. I am speaking here of our
                        belief in ourselves and our belief in our Nation.</p>
                    <p>Abraham Lincoln asked, in his own words, and I quote, “What constitutes the
                        bulwark of our own liberty and independence?” And he answered, “It is not
                        our frowning battlements or bristling seacoasts, our Army or our Navy. Our
                        defense is in the spirit which prized liberty as the heritage of all men, in
                        all lands everywhere.”</p>
                    <p>It is in this spirit that we must now move beyond the discords of the past
                        decade. It is in this spirit that I ask you to join me in writing an agenda
                        for the future.</p>
                    <p>I welcome your invitation particularly tonight, because I know it is at
                        Tulane and other centers of thought throughout our great country that much
                        consideration is being given to the kind of future Americans want and, just
                        as importantly, will work for. Each of you are preparing yourselves for the
                        future, and I am deeply interested in your preparations and your opinions
                        and your goals. However, tonight, with your indulgence, let me share with
                        you my own views.</p>
                    <p>I envision a creative program that goes as far as our courage and our
                        capacities can take us, both at home and abroad. My goal is for a
                        cooperative world at peace, using its resources to build, not to
                        destroy.</p>
                    <p>As President, I am determined to offer leadership to overcome our current
                        economic problems. My goal is for jobs for all who want to work and economic
                        opportunity for all who want to achieve.</p>
                    <pb n="307" facs="0338" xml:id="pg_307"/>
                    <p>I am determined to seek self-sufficiency in energy as an urgent national
                        priority. My goal is to make America independent of foreign energy sources
                        by 1985.</p>
                    <p>Of course, I will pursue interdependence with other nations and a reformed
                        international economic system. My goal is for a world in which consuming and
                        producing nations achieve a working balance.</p>
                    <p>I will address the humanitarian issues of hunger and famine, of health and of
                        healing. My goal is to achieve—or to assure basic needs and an effective
                        system to achieve this result.</p>
                    <p>I recognize the need for technology that enriches life while preserving our
                        natural environment. My goal is to stimulate productivity, but use
                        technology to redeem, not to destroy our environment.</p>
                    <p>I will strive for new cooperation rather than conflict in the peaceful
                        exploration of our oceans and our space. My goal is to use resources for
                        peaceful progress rather than war and destruction.</p>
                    <p>Let America symbolize humanity’s struggle to conquer nature and master
                        technology. The time has now come for our Government to facilitate the
                        individual’s control over his or her future—and of the future of
                        America.</p>
                    <p>But the future requires more than Americans congratulating themselves on how
                        much we know and how many products that we can produce. It requires new
                        knowledge to meet new problems. We must not only be motivated to build a
                        better America, we must know how to do it.</p>
                    <p>If we really want a humane America that will, for instance, contribute to the
                        alleviation of the world’s hunger, we must realize that good intentions do
                        not feed people. Some problems, as anyone who served in the Congress knows,
                        are complex. There are no easy answers. Willpower alone does not grow
                        food.</p>
                    <p>We thought, in a well-intentioned past, that we could export our technology
                        lock, stock, and barrel to developing nations. We did it with the best of
                        intentions. But we are now learning that a strain of rice that grows in one
                        place will not grow in another; that factories that produce at 100 percent
                        in one nation produce less than half as much in a society where temperaments
                        and work habits are somewhat different.</p>
                    <p>Yet, the world economy has become interdependent. Not only food technology
                        but money management, natural resources and energy, research and
                        development—all kinds of this group require an organized world society that
                        makes the maximum effective use of the world’s resources.</p>
                    <p>I want to tell the world: Let’s grow food together, but let’s also learn more
                        about nutrition, about weather forecasting, about irrigation, <pb n="308"
                            facs="0339" xml:id="pg_308"/>about the many other specialties involved
                        in helping people to help themselves.</p>
                    <p>We must learn more about people, about the development of communities,
                        architecture, engineering, education, motivation, productivity, public
                        health and medicine, arts and sciences, political, legal, and social
                        organization. All of these specialities and many, many more are required if
                        young people like you are to help this Nation develop an agenda for our
                        future—your future, our country’s future.</p>
                    <p>I challenge, for example, the medical students in this audience to put on
                        their agenda the achievement of a cure for cancer. I challenge the engineers
                        in this audience to devise new techniques for developing cheap, clean, and
                        plentiful energy, and as a byproduct, to control floods. I challenge the law
                        students in this audience to find ways to speed the administration of equal
                        justice and make good citizens out of convicted criminals. I challenge
                        education, those of you as education majors, to do real teaching for real
                        life. I challenge the arts majors in this audience to compose the great
                        American symphony, to write the great American novel, and to enrich and
                        inspire our daily lives.</p>
                    <p>America’s leadership is essential. America’s resources are vast. America’s
                        opportunities are unprecedented.</p>
                    <p>As we strive together to prefect a new agenda, I put high on the list of
                        important points the maintenance of alliances and partnerships with other
                        people and other nations. These do provide a basis of shared values, even as
                        we stand up with determination for what we believe. This, of course,
                        requires a continuing commitment to peace and a determination to use our
                        good offices wherever possible to promote better relations between nations
                        of this world.</p>
                    <p>The new agenda, that which is developed by you and by us, must place a high
                        priority on the need to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and to work for
                        the mutual reduction in strategic arms and control of other weapons. And I
                        must say, parenthetically, the successful negotiations at Vladivostok, in my
                        opinion, are just a beginning.</p>
                    <p>Your generation of Americans is uniquely endowed by history to give new
                        meaning to the pride and spirit of America. The magnetism of an American
                        society, confident of its own strength, will attract the good will and the
                        esteem of all people wherever they might be in this globe in which we live.
                        It will enhance our own perception of ourselves and our pride in being an
                        American. We can, we <hi rend="italic">can</hi>—and I say it with
                        emphasis—write a new agenda for our future.</p>
                    <p>I am glad that Tulane University and other great American educational
                        institutions are reaching out to others in programs to work with developing
                        nations, and I look forward with confidence to your participation in every
                        aspect of America’s future.</p>
                    <pb n="309" facs="0340" xml:id="pg_309"/>
                    <p>And I urge Americans of all ages to unite in this Bicentennial year, to take
                        responsibility for themselves as our ancestors did. Let us resolve tonight
                        to rediscover the old virtues of confidence and self-reliance and capability
                        that characterized our forefathers two centuries ago. I pledge, as I know
                        you do, each one of us, to do our part.</p>
                    <p>Let the beacon light of the past shine forth from historic New Orleans and
                        from Tulane University and from every other corner of this land to
                        illuminate a boundless future for all Americans and a peace for all
                        mankind.</p>

                        Developments in Southeast Asia and Elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>1. I want to share with each of you my thoughts on where we stand and how we
                        should comport ourselves in light of recent developments, particularly the
                        events in Indochina. The President first addressed these issues broadly in

                    <p>2. There is no denying that we have experienced serious setbacks and
                        disappointments in recent weeks. Some were beyond our control. Some we
                        inflicted upon ourselves. As a consequence, we must be prepared to face
                        tests of our own resolve and staying power in the weeks and months to come.
                        Many here are inclined to discount the impact of the events in Southeast
                        Asia on our international role. They look upon the termination of the
                        North-South conflict with apparent relief. They emphasize that the recent
                        defeats are a consequence of shortcomings in the capabilities of our
                        friends. They underscore the unique features of the Indochina conflict, and
                        hope that other governments will not regard our actions there as indicative
                        of a general retreat from overseas responsibilities. They argue that the
                        closing of this chapter of our Southeast Asia policy will permit a more
                        effective deployment of our resources and commitments in the world.</p>
                    <p>3. While there is some validity to many of these views, it would be idle and
                        dangerous to leave the situation at that. We cannot ignore the fact that we
                        have, indeed, suffered some major reverses and proceed as if nothing had
                        really happened. America is a strong nation that can—and will—solve its
                        problems only by facing up to them. Even those governments that have been
                        most critical of our involvement in Vietnam, which have most earnestly
                        regretted the diversion of our resources and attention which our involvement
                        produced, and which most fervently hoped for an end to the fractious
                        divisions in American opinion which it spawned, now harbor questions about
                        our ability and willingness to make those difficult decisions which are the
                        lot of a great power. We would be deluding ourselves if we discounted the
                        evidence that what has happened in Indochina—and in Washington—has
                        disquieted many of our friends, especially in Asia. We will have to respond
                        to many of these concerns promptly and firmly. Also we must recognize the
                        fact that these events have serious implications for how we as a people see
                        our role in the world. We will have to do some major rethinking and work
                        hard to shore up the domestic foundations of our policy. Rhetoric alone will
                        not do the job. The impact of recent events will be measured by how we as a
                        nation meet our challenges in the coming months.</p>
                    <p>4. In our dealings with foreign officials and leaders our conduct must be
                        guided by several general considerations:</p>
                    <p>A. We must not dwell excessively on the past. We need to look ahead. That is
                        the tone we intend to set here. The President and I have made it clear that
                        we intend to avoid a divisive national debate designed to apportion blame
                        for developments in Indochina. Recriminations are a luxury we can ill
                        afford. There is enough anguish and blame to go around. Americans, at home
                        and abroad, must conduct their na<pb n="311" facs="0342" xml:id="pg_311"
                        />tional foreign policy debate with moderation, tolerance, and mutual
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>B. Without ignoring or denying past setbacks we must retain a sense of
                        proportion about them. This is no time to be apologetic or defensive about
                        our role in the world. A display of self-doubt and timidity at this juncture
                        would further undermine the confidence of our friends and diminish our
                        adversaries’ incentives for restraint. If we demonstrate a loss of national
                        nerve now we will merely compound our future difficulties. Thus, we must
                        convey with unmistakable clarity to potential adversaries that our current
                        difficulties imply no slackening of our resolve to meet our commitments or
                        to respond to challenges. We will not be bellicose, but neither will we be
                        pushed around. Above all we must convey to both adversaries and allies an
                        impression of confidence in our purposes and steadiness in their
                        implementation.</p>
                    <p>C. We need to stand up for our views both in our bilateral contacts and in
                        international forums. Silence or defensiveness in the face of attacks on our
                        motives and our record bear little place under normal circumstances; they
                        have no place now. We need not apologize for our system, our record of
                        magnanimity to others, or the major initiatives which we have taken in
                        recent years to promote greater stability in global political relationships
                        and to cope with structural problems in the world economy. Our role in
                        Indochina particularly is not a fitting subject for public self-criticism.
                        We undertook our obligations there with honorable intent. We endured major
                        sacrifices on behalf of a country in which we sought no territorial,
                        economic or political advantage. And our efforts helped to buy time for our
                        Asian friends to strengthen their security and prosperity.</p>
                    <p>D. The essentials of our foreign policy design remain intact. Our relations
                        with Japan and the Western European democracies are extraordinarily free of
                        bilateral problems; they are marked by greater equity and more intensive
                        consultation than ever before. The premises of our détente strategy toward
                        Moscow and Peking remain valid. We will work to see that détente continues
                        to yield a balance of advantages and that potential adversaries do not seek
                        to exploit what they may perceive as opportunities. We expect further
                        progress this year in limiting strategic arms deployments and expanding
                        commercial and other bilateral exchanges with the Soviets, and in proceeding
                        on our course of normalization with the Chinese. Despite a temporary setback
                        in our Middle East diplomacy, the parties to that conflict still recognize
                        us as the only outside power capable of facilitating a settlement, and we
                        intend to persevere. Our efforts to design a longer term response to key
                        structural problems facing the global economy are bearing fruit. We now
                        possess flexible negotiating authority for the multilateral trade
                        negotiations. We have achieved a gratifying degree of solidarity with <pb
                            n="312" facs="0343" xml:id="pg_312"/>other consuming countries in the
                        energy field; the measures we have thus far taken are producing real shifts
                        in the supply and demand picture for oil. Our food initiatives have been
                        well received and we expect to elaborate on them further in the months
                        ahead. We are beginning to develop a network of intensive and mutually
                        beneficial ties with some of the more assertive and powerful resource-rich
                        countries. And we are prepared to search with compassion for solutions to
                        the issues raised by the developing countries—assuming that realism and
                        mutual cooperation infuse the international dialogue. In short, given this
                        record of substantial accomplishment there is no excuse for masochistic
                        self-doubt and self-flagellation. And given our military, economic, and
                        technological strength we have an indispensable role to play in furthering
                        global stability and prosperity.</p>
                    <p>5. Clearly reassurances from members of the executive branch, however
                        indispensable in conveying an impression of confidence and constancy, will
                        not put to rest all questions about our reliability. There is no doubt that
                        the public consensus underlying our policies needs extensive rebuilding.
                        There are significant forces preaching retrenchment. Widespread skepticism
                        does exist about the efficacy of military force to buttress our diplomacy.
                        The tendency to generalize and simplify foreign policy problems on the basis
                        of our experience in Vietnam alone is evident in much of the media’s
                        commentary. The Congress has become more assertive on foreign policy issues
                        at precisely the moment when power on the Hill has become exceedingly
                        diffuse. The result of all these factors can be drift, frustration, and
                        accommodation of special interests at the expense of the integrity of our
                        larger foreign policy design and purposes.</p>
                    <p>6. Without ignoring these problems, they must be placed in context for
                        foreign audiences. Recent disappointments have not demoralized the American
                        public. Our people retain a fundamental strength, buoyancy, optimism, and
                        magnanimity which has not been shaken by recent events. In the face of a
                        convulsive dozen years Americans, and their institutions, have shown a
                        remarkable resiliency. Nor is there any disposition to retreat from global
                        responsibilities. Recent polls on <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> public
                        attitudes toward foreign policy issues indicate that most Americans
                        recognize that the reality of interdependence is inescapable. There remains
                        remarkably strong support for the kind of cooperative international
                        relationships and peacekeeping activities which have characterized <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> foreign policy for a generation. I am
                        convinced that the American people will continue to support a dynamic,
                        responsible role in world affairs, grounded in policies that serve
                        well-defined American interests. Partly as a result of this, I am also
                        confident that over time we will be able to rebuild our partnership with
                        Congress along the lines <pb n="313" facs="0344" xml:id="pg_313"/>that I set
                        forth in my Los Angeles speech of January 24.<note n="5" xml:id="d58fn5">See
                                <ref target="#d52fn6">footnote 6, Document 52</ref>.</note> The
                        Congress has a vital role to play in our foreign policy in line with its
                        constitutional responsibilities and the need to reflect the popular will in
                        a democracy. The administration is determined to forge a cooperative
                        relationship with the legislative branch.</p>
                    <p>7. As we succeed in putting behind us the effects of Indochina we can display
                        the effective and unified national policy that we and the world so badly
                        need. Realistically, however, we must accept the fact that we have difficult
                        days ahead of us. Since our national problems are on such wide international
                        view, you and your staff will have special responsibility to project the
                        real values and interests of the United States in this difficult interim
                        period. I know that I can count on you to do so in the best traditions of
                        the Foreign Service. With your help I am confident that the United States
                        will continue to be a major force for building a more peaceful, prosperous
                        and humane world.</p>

                    <p>Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have long looked forward to
                        coming to Minnesota because it is the home of a man I admire enormously, the
                        one man who likes to talk almost as much as I do—Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName>. At the hearings on my nomination
                        as Secretary of State, Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1"
                            >Humphrey</persName> instructed me with much wisdom on the difficult job
                        ahead. His advice was right on the mark, and has been ever since. He is a
                        good friend, and a great statesman. Minnesotans can <pb n="314" facs="0345"
                            xml:id="pg_314"/>be proud that he represents them in the United States
                        Senate, for he is an example of the spirit of our country—its decency, its
                        humanity, and its strength.</p>
                    <p>America has now entered upon its 200th year as a free nation. In those 2
                        centuries our country has grown from a small agricultural nation with very
                        few responsibilities beyond its borders to a world power with global
                        responsibilities. Yet, while the range of interests has changed massively,
                        our commitment to the values that gave birth to our nation has remained
                        unaltered.</p>
                    <p>These are the aspects of our national experience I would like to address
                        today: the pursuit of America’s values as a humane and just example to
                        others; and the furthering of America’s interests in a world where power
                        remains the ultimate arbiter. How do we reconcile and advance both aspects
                        of our national purpose? What, in our time, is the significance of the
                        age-old quandary of the relationship between principle and power?</p>
                    <p>Through the greater part of our history we have been able to avoid the issue.
                        A fortunate margin of safety and an unexplored continent produced the
                        impression that principle and power automatically coalesced, that no choice
                        was necessary or that only one choice was possible.</p>
                    <p>But now for nearly a decade our nation has been weighed down by uncertainty
                        and discord. We have found ourselves doubtful of our virtue and uncertain of
                        our direction largely because we have suddenly realized that like other
                        nations before us we must now reconcile our principles with our necessities.
                        Amid frustration, many Americans questioned the validity of our involvement
                        in the international arena; in the wake of our disappointments, some abroad
                        now doubt our resolve.</p>
                    <p>We are, I believe, emerging from this period with a renewed sense of
                        confidence. Recent events have brought home to us—and to the rest of the
                        world—that a purposeful, strong, and involved America is essential to peace
                        and progress. These same events have also reminded us of the contribution
                        this country made in the 30 years since World War II—and what is at stake in
                        the next 30 years.</p>
                    <p>The United States can look back on an extraordinary generation of
                        achievement. We have maintained a stable balance of power in the world; we
                        have preserved peace and fostered the growth of the industrial democracies
                        of North America, Western Europe, and Japan. We helped shape the
                        international trade and monetary system which has nourished global
                        prosperity. We promoted decolonization and pioneered in development
                        assistance for the new nations. We have taken major initiatives to forge
                        more reliable and positive relationships with the major Communist
                        powers.</p>
                    <pb n="315" facs="0346" xml:id="pg_315"/>
                    <p>In a planet shrunk by communications and technology, in a world either
                        devastated by war or struggling in the first steps of nationhood, in an
                        international system not of empire but of scores of independent states, the
                        global contribution of one nation—the United States—has been without
                        precedent in human history. Only a nation of strong conviction and great
                        idealism could have accomplished these efforts. We shall not turn our backs
                        on this legacy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Modern Agenda</p>
                    <p>Today we face a new agenda. Our accomplishments over the past generation have
                        changed the world and defined our tasks for the coming decades:</p>
                    <p>• Our allies, the major industrial democracies, have recovered their vigor
                        and influence. We are transforming our alliances into more equal
                        partnerships. We shall act in harmony with friends whose security and
                        prosperity is indispensable to our own and whose cooperation is essential
                        for progress and justice.</p>
                    <p>• The incredible destructiveness of modern weapons has transformed
                        international politics. We must maintain our military strength. But we have
                        an obligation, in our own interest as well as the world’s, to work with
                        other nations to control both the growth and the spread of nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>• In our relations with the Communist powers we must never lose sight of the
                        fact that in the thermonuclear age general war would be disastrous to
                        mankind. We have an obligation to seek a more productive and stable
                        relationship despite the basic antagonism of our values.</p>
                    <p>• Thirty years of economic and political evolution have brought about a new
                        diffusion of power and initiative. At the same time, interdependence imposes
                        upon all nations the reality that they must prosper together or suffer
                        together. The destinies of the world’s nations have become inevitably
                        intertwined. Thus, the capacity of any one nation to shape events is more
                        limited, and consequently our own choices are more difficult and
                        complex.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Legacy of Our Past</p>
                    <p>To deal with this agenda we require strength of purpose and conviction. A
                        nation unsure of its values cannot shape its future. A people confused about
                        its direction will miss the opportunity to build a better and more peaceful
                        world. This is why perhaps our deepest challenge is our willingness to face
                        the increasing ambiguity of the problem of ends and means.</p>
                    <p>We start with strong assets. Throughout our history we have sought to define
                        and justify our foreign policy in terms of principle. We have never seen
                        ourselves as just another nation-state pursuing selfish <pb n="316"
                            facs="0347" xml:id="pg_316"/>aims. We have always stood for something
                        beyond ourselves—a beacon to the oppressed from other lands—from the first
                        settlers to the recent refugees from Indochina. This conviction of our
                        uniqueness contributed to our unity, gave focus to our priorities, and
                        sustained our confidence in ourselves. It has been, and is, a powerful
                        force.</p>
                    <p>But the emphasis on principle has also produced a characteristic American
                        ambivalence. Relations with a world of nations falling short of our ideal
                        have always presented us with dilemmas. As a people, we have oscillated
                        between insistence on our uniqueness and the quest for broad acceptance of
                        our values; between trying to influence international developments and
                        seeking to isolate ourselves from them; between expecting too much of our
                        power and being ashamed of it; between optimistic exuberance and frustration
                        with the constraints practicality imposes.</p>
                    <p>Through most of our history we have sought to shield our country and
                        hemisphere from outside intrusion, to shun involvement in balance-of-power
                        politics. Soldiers and diplomats—the practitioners of power—have always been
                        looked upon with suspicion. We considered generosity in relief efforts, the
                        encouragement of free international trade, and the protection of our
                        economic interests abroad as the only wholesome forms of international
                        involvement.</p>
                    <p>Our founding fathers were sophisticated men who understood the European
                        balance of power and knew how to profit from it. For the succeeding century
                        and a half, our security was assured by favorable circumstances over which
                        we had little influence. Shielded by two oceans, and enriched by a bountiful
                        nature, we proclaimed our special situation as universally valid to nations
                        whose narrower margin of survival meant that their range of choices was far
                        more limited than our own.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the concern of other nations for security reinforced our sense of
                        uniqueness. We were a haven for millions, a place where the injustices,
                        inequities, privations, and abridgements of human dignity which the
                        immigrants had suffered were absent, or amenable to rapid redress. As our
                        strength and size expanded, we remained uncomfortable with the uses and
                        responsibilities of power and involvement in day-to-day diplomacy. At the
                        turn of the century, for example, there were soul-searching debates over the
                        Spanish-American War and our first acquisition of noncontiguous territories.
                        While many saw our policies as dictated by our interests, others considered
                        them our entrance into a morally questionable world.</p>
                    <p>Our tradition of law encouraged repeated attempts to legislate solutions to
                        international conflicts. Arbitration, conciliation, international legal
                        arrangements, neutrality legislation, collective security systems—all these
                        were invoked to banish the reality of power. And when our involvement in
                        conflict became unavoidable in 1917, Woodrow Wilson <pb n="317" facs="0348"
                            xml:id="pg_317"/>translated our geopolitical interest in preventing any
                        nation’s hegemony in Europe into a universal moral objective. We fought to
                        “make the world safe for democracy.”</p>
                    <p>The inevitable disillusionment with an imperfect outcome led to a tide of
                        isolationist sentiment. The Great Depression drew our energies further
                        inward, as we sought to deal with the problems of our own society—even as
                        that same depression simultaneously generated real dangers abroad.</p>
                    <p>We were stirred from isolation only by external attack and we sustained our
                        effort because of the obvious totalitarian evil. We opposed all-out war, and
                        total victory further strengthened our sense of moral rectitude—and ill
                        prepared us for the aftermath. Of all the nations involved, we alone emerged
                        essentially unscathed from the ravages of conflict—our military power,
                        economic strength, and political confidence intact. And in the postwar
                        bipolar world of cold war confrontation we believed we faced a reincarnation
                        of the just defeated foe—an apparently monolithic and hostile ideological
                        empire whose ambitions and values were antithetical to our own.</p>
                    <p>Our success and the preeminent position it brought convinced us that we could
                        shape the globe according to American design. Our preponderant power gave us
                        a broad margin for error so we believed that we could overwhelm problems
                        through the sheer weight of resources. No other nation possessed so much
                        insurance against so many contingencies; we could afford to be imprecise in
                        the definition of our interests. Indeed, we often imagined that we had
                        nothing so selfish as interests—only obligations and responsibilities. In a
                        period of seemingly clear-cut, black-and-white divisions, we harbored few
                        doubts about the validity of our cause.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">America’s Role</p>
                    <p>We no longer live in so simple a world. We remain the strongest nation and
                        the largest single factor in international affairs. Our leadership is
                        perhaps even more essential than before. But our strategic superiority has
                        given way to nuclear balance. Our political and economic predominance has
                        diminished as others have grown in strength and our dependence on the world
                        economy has increased. Our margin of safety has shrunk.</p>
                    <p>Today we find that—like most other nations in history—we can neither escape
                        from the world nor dominate it. Today we must conduct diplomacy with
                        subtlety, flexibility, maneuver, and imagination in the pursuit of our
                        interests. We must be thoughtful in defining our interests. We must prepare
                        against the worst contingency and not plan only for the best. We must pursue
                        limited objectives and many objectives simultaneously. In this effort, the
                        last decade has taught us:</p>
                    <pb n="318" facs="0349" xml:id="pg_318"/>
                    <p>• That our power will not always bring preferred solutions; but we are still
                        strong enough to influence events, often decisively.</p>
                    <p>• That we cannot remedy all the world’s ills; but we can help build an
                        international structure that will foster the initiative and cooperation of
                        others.</p>
                    <p>• That we can no longer expect that moral judgments expressed in absolute
                        terms will command broad acceptance; but as the richest and most powerful
                        nation, we still have a special responsibility to look beyond narrow
                        definitions of our national interests and to serve as a sponsor of world
                        order.</p>
                    <p>• That we cannot banish power politics from international affairs, but we can
                        promote new and wider communities of interest among nations; we can mute the
                        use and threat of force; we can help establish incentives for restraint and
                        penalties for its absence; we can encourage the resolution of disputes
                        through negotiation; and we can help construct a more equitable pattern of
                        relations between developed and developing nations.</p>
                    <p>This new complexity has produced in some a rebellion against contemporary
                        foreign policy. We are told that our foreign policy is excessively
                        pragmatic, that it sacrifices virtue in the mechanical pursuit of stability.
                        Once attacked as cold-war oriented, we are now criticized by some as
                        insensitive to moral values. Once regarded as naive in the use of power, we
                        are now alleged to rely too much on the efficacy of force. Once viewed as
                        the most generous of nations, we now stand accused by some of resisting a
                        more equitable international economic system.</p>
                    <p>It is time to face the reality of our situation. Our choice is not between
                        morality and pragmatism. We cannot escape either, nor are they incompatible.
                        This nation must be true to its own beliefs or it will lose its bearings in
                        the world. But at the same time it must survive in a world of sovereign
                        nations and competing wills.</p>
                    <p>We need moral strength to select among often agonizing choices and a sense of
                        purpose to navigate between the shoals of difficult decisions. But we need
                        as well a mature sense of means, lest we substitute wishful thinking for the
                        requirements of survival.</p>
                    <p>Clearly we are in need of perspective. Let me state some basic
                        principles:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign policy must start with security.</hi> A nation’s
                        survival is its first and ultimate responsibility; it cannot be compromised
                        or put to risk. There can be no security for us or for others unless the
                        strength of the free countries is in balance with that of potential
                        adversaries; and no stability in power relationships is conceivable without
                        America’s active participation in world affairs.</p>
                    <p>The choices in foreign policy are often difficult and the margins are
                        frequently narrow; imperfect solutions are sometimes unavoidable. In <pb
                            n="319" facs="0350" xml:id="pg_319"/>the Second World War, for example,
                        we joined forces with countries whose values we did not share in order to
                        accomplish the morally worthy objective of defeating Nazism. Today we
                        cooperate with many nations for the purpose of regional stability and global
                        security, even though we disapprove of some of their internal practices.
                        These choices are made consciously, and based on our best assessment of what
                        is necessary.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">At the same time, security is a means not an end.</hi> The
                        purpose of security is to safeguard the values of our free society. And our
                        survival is not always at stake in international issues. Many of our
                        decisions are not imposed on us by events. Where we have latitude we must

                    <p>Our assistance to developing nations, for example, serves both foreign policy
                        and humanitarian ends. It strengthens political ties to other nations. It
                        contributes to expanded trade; close to 90 percent of our foreign assistance
                        is eventually spent in this country. And our assistance reflects our values
                        as a people, because we cannot close our eyes to the suffering of others.
                        Because of history and moral tradition, we cannot live with ourselves as an

                        possible only with public support. Therefore your government owes you an
                        articulation of the purposes which its policies are designed to serve; to
                        make clear our premises, to contribute to enlightened debate, and to explain
                        how our policies serve the American people’s objectives. And those
                        principles—freedom, the dignity of the individual, the sanctity of law—are
                        at the heart of our policy; they are also the foundation of our most basic

                    <p>The relation of morality to policy is thus not an abstract philosophical
                        issue. It applies to many topics of the current debate. It applies to
                        relations with the Communist powers, where we must manage a conflict of
                        moral purposes and interests in the shadow of nuclear peril; and <pb n="320"

                        nations whose domestic practices are inconsistent with our own.</p>
                    <p>Our relationship with the Communist powers has raised difficult questions for
                        Americans since the Bolshevik Revolution. It was understood very early that
                        the Communist system and ideology were in conflict with our own principles.
                        Sixteen years passed before President <persName corresp="#p_RFD_1">Franklin
                            Roosevelt</persName> extended diplomatic recognition to the Soviet
                        Government. He did so in the belief, as he put it, that <hi rend="italic"
                            >“through the resumption of normal relations the prospects of peace over
                            all the world are greatly strengthened.”</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Today again courageous voices remind us of the nature of the Soviet system
                        and of our duty to defend freedom. About this there is no disagreement.</p>
                    <p>There is, however, a clear conflict between two moral imperatives which is at
                        the heart of the problem. Since the dawn of the nuclear age, the world’s
                        fears of holocaust and its hopes for a better future have both hinged on the
                        relationship between the two superpowers. In an era of strategic nuclear
                        balance—when both sides have the capacity to destroy civilized life—there is
                        no alternative to coexistence. In such conditions the necessity of peace is
                        itself a moral imperative. As President Kennedy pointed out: <hi
                            rend="italic">“In the final analysis our most basic common link is that
                            we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all
                            cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.”</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is said, correctly, that the Soviet perception of “peaceful coexistence”
                        is not the same as ours, that Soviet policies aim at the furthering of
                        Soviet objectives. In a world of nuclear weapons capable of destroying
                        mankind, in a century which has seen resort to brutal force on an
                        unprecedented scale and intensity, in an age of ideology which turns the
                        domestic policies of nations into issues of international contention, the
                        problem of peace takes on a profound moral and practical difficulty. But the
                        issue, surely, is not whether peace and stability serve Soviet purposes, but
                        whether they also serve our own. Constructive actions in Soviet policy are
                        desirable <hi rend="italic">whatever</hi> the Soviet motives.</p>
                    <p>This Government has stated clearly and constantly the principles which <hi

                        international conduct and which are consistent with both our values and our
                        interests:</p>
                    <p>• We will maintain a strong and flexible military posture to preserve our
                        security. We will as a matter of principle and national interest oppose
                        attempts by any country to achieve global or regional predominance.</p>
                    <p>• We will judge the state of U.S.-Soviet relations not by atmospherics but by
                        whether concrete problems are successfully resolved.</p>
                    <pb n="321" facs="0352" xml:id="pg_321"/>
                    <p>• All negotiations will be a two-way street, based on reciprocity of benefit
                        and reliable observance of agreements.</p>
                    <p>• We will insist, as we always have, that progress in U.S.-Soviet economic
                        relations must reflect progress toward stable political relationships.</p>
                    <p>• We will never abandon our ideals or our friends. We will not negotiate over
                        the heads of, or against the interests of, other nations.</p>
                    <p>• We will respond firmly to attempts to achieve unilateral advantage, or to
                        apply the relaxation of tensions selectively.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the necessities of coexistence there is the hope of a more positive
                        relationship. The American people will never be satisfied with simply
                        reducing tension and easing the danger of nuclear holocaust. Over the longer
                        term, we hope that firmness in the face of pressure and the creation of
                        incentives for cooperative action may bring about a more durable pattern of
                        stability and responsible conduct.</p>

                        progress has been made on a wide range of problems. Berlin has been removed
                        as a source of conflict between East and West; crises have been dampened;
                        the frequency of U.S.-Soviet consultation on bilateral and multilateral
                        problems is unprecedented; the scope of bilateral exchanges and cooperation
                        in many fields is in dramatic contrast to the state of affairs 10, even 5,
                        years ago. The agreements already achieved to limit strategic armament
                        programs—the central weapons of our respective military arsenals—are
                        unparalleled in the history of diplomacy. Your Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_MWF_1">[Walter F.] Mondale</persName> is a strong and
                        constructive advocate of such strategic arms control efforts.</p>
                    <p>Our immediate focus is on the international actions of the Soviet Union not
                        because it is our only moral concern, but because it is the sphere of action
                        that we can most directly and confidently affect. As a consequence of
                        improved foreign policy relationships, we have successfully used our
                        influence to promote human rights. But we have done so quietly, keeping in
                        mind the delicacy of the problem and stressing results rather than public
                        confrontation.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, critics of détente must answer: What is the alternative that they
                        propose? What precise policies do they want us to change? Are they prepared
                        for a prolonged situation of dramatically increased international danger? Do
                        they wish to return to the constant crises and <pb n="322" facs="0353"
                            xml:id="pg_322"/>high arms budgets of the cold war? Does détente
                        encourage repression—or is it détente that has generated the ferment and the
                        demands for openness that we are now witnessing? Can we ask our people to
                        support confrontation unless they know that every reasonable alternative has
                        been explored?</p>
                    <p>In our relations with the Soviet Union, the United States will maintain its
                        strength, defend its interests, and support its friends with determination
                        and without illusion. We will speak up for our beliefs with vigor and
                        without self-deception. We consider détente a means to regulate a
                        competitive relationship—not a substitute for our own efforts in building
                        the strength of the free world. We will continue on the course on which we
                        are embarked because it offers hope to our children of a more secure and a
                        more just world.</p>
                    <p>These considerations raise a more general question: To what extent are we
                        able to affect the internal policies of other governments and to what extent
                        is it desirable?</p>
                    <p>There are some 150 nations in the world, and barely a score of them are
                        democracies in any real sense. The rest are nations whose ideology or
                        political practices are inconsistent with our own. Yet we have political
                        relations and often alliances with some of these countries in Asia, Latin
                        America, Africa, and Europe.</p>
                    <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_FDM_1">[Donald M.] Fraser</persName> has
                        raised this issue with great integrity and concern, and I have profited from
                        many discussions with him. We do not and will not condone repressive
                        practices. This is not only dictated by our values but is also a reflection
                        of the reality that regimes which lack legitimacy or moral authority are
                        inherently vulnerable. There will therefore be limits to the degree to which
                        such regimes can be congenial partners. We have used, and we will use, our
                        influence against repressive practices. Our traditions and our interests
                        demand it.</p>
                    <p>But truth compels also a recognition of our limits. The question is whether
                        we promote human rights more effectively by counsel and friendly relations
                        where this serves our interest, or by confrontational propaganda and
                        discriminatory legislation. And we must also assess the domestic performance
                        of foreign governments in relation to their history and to the threats they
                        face. We must have some understanding for the dilemmas of countries
                        adjoining powerful, hostile, and irreconcilable totalitarian regimes.</p>
                    <p>Our alliances and political relationships serve mutual ends; they contribute
                        to regional and world security, and thus support the broader welfare. They
                        are not favors to other governments, but reflect a recognition of mutual
                        interests. They should be withdrawn only when our interests change and not
                        as a punishment for some act with which we do not agree. In many countries,
                        whatever the internal structure, the <pb n="323" facs="0354" xml:id="pg_323"
                        />populations are unified in seeking our protection against outside
                        aggression. In many countries our foreign policy relationships have proved
                        to be no obstacle to the forces of change. And in many countries—especially
                        in Asia—it is the process of American disengagement that has eroded the
                        sense of security and created a perceived need for greater internal
                        discipline, and at the same time diminished our ability to influence
                        domestic practices.</p>
                    <p>The attempt to deal with those practices by restrictive American legislation
                        raises a serious problem, not because of the moral view it expresses—which
                        we share—but because of the mistaken impression it creates that our security
                        ties are acts of charity. And beyond that, such acts—because they are too
                        public, too inflexible, and too much a stimulus to nationalistic
                        resentment—are almost inevitably doomed to fail.</p>
                    <p>There are no simple answers. Painful experience should have taught us that we
                        ought not exaggerate our capacity to foresee, let alone to shape, social and
                        political change in other societies. Therefore let me state the principles
                        that will guide our action:</p>
                    <p>• Human rights are a legitimate international concern and have been so
                        defined in international agreements for more than a generation.</p>
                    <p>• The United States will speak up for human rights in appropriate
                        international forums and in exchanges with other governments.</p>
                    <p>• We will be mindful of the limits of our reach; we will be conscious of the
                        difference between public postures that satisfy our self-esteem and policies
                        that bring positive results.</p>
                    <p>• We will not lose sight of either the requirements of global security or
                        what we stand for as a nation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Domestic Dimension</p>
                    <p>For Americans, then, the question is not whether our values should affect our
                        foreign policy, but how. The issue is whether we have the courage to face
                        complexity and the inner conviction to deal with ambiguity; whether we will
                        look behind easy slogans and recognize that our great goals can only be
                        reached by patience, and in imperfect stages.</p>
                    <p>The question is also whether we will use our moral convictions to escape
                        reality or as a source of courage and self-confidence. We hear too often
                        assertions that were a feature of our isolationist period: That a balance of
                        power is a cynical game; that secret conspiratorial intentions lurk behind
                        open, public policies; that weapons are themselves the sources of conflict;
                        that intelligence activities are wicked; that humanitarian assistance and
                        participation in the economic order are an adequate substitute for political
                        engagement.</p>

                    <p>These are the counsels of despair. I refuse to accept the premise that our
                        moral values and policy objectives are irreconcilable. The ends we seek in
                        our foreign policy must have validity in the framework of our beliefs or we
                        have no meaningful foreign policy. The maintenance of peace is a moral as
                        well as a practical objective: Measures to limit armaments serve a moral as
                        well as practical end; the cohesion of our alliances with the great
                        industrial democracies makes our way of life and our principles more secure;
                        cooperation to improve the world economic system enhances the well-being of
                        peoples; policies to reconcile the rich nations and the poor, and to enhance
                        the progress of both, serve a humane as well as a political end.</p>
                    <p>We live in a secular age which prides itself on its realism. Modern society
                        is impersonal and bureaucratized. The young, who in every generation crave a
                        sense of purpose, are too often offered cynicism and escapism instead of a
                        faith that truly inspires. All modern democracies are beset by problems
                        beyond the margin of governments’ ability to control. Debunking of authority
                        further drains democratic government of the ability to address the problems
                        that beset it. A world of turmoil and danger cries out for structure and
                        leadership. The opportunities that we face as a nation to help shape a more
                        just international order depend more than ever on a steady, resolute, and
                        self-assured America.</p>
                    <p>This requires confidence—the leaders’ confidence in their values, the
                        public’s confidence in its government, and the nation’s collective
                        confidence in the worth of its objectives.</p>
                    <p>Thus, for this nation to contribute truly to peace in the world it must make
                        peace with itself. It is time to put aside the cynicism and distrust that
                        have marked, and marred, our political life for the better part of the past
                        decade. It is time to remind ourselves that while we may disagree about
                        means, as Americans we all have the same ultimate objective—the peace,
                        prosperity, and tranquillity of our country and of the world.</p>
                    <p>And most of all, it is time we recognized that as the greatest democracy the
                        world has ever known, we are a living reminder that there is an alternative
                        to tyranny and oppression. The revolution that we began 200 years ago goes
                        on, for most of the world still lives without the freedom that has for so
                        long been ours. To them we remain a beacon of hope and an example to be
                        emulated.</p>
                    <p>So let us come together for the tasks that our time demands. We have before
                        us an opportunity to bring peace to a world that awaits our leadership.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>You asked for a candid assessment of foreign policy during your first 12
                        months in office. I know it has not been an easy year given the situation
                        you inherited. We continue to face many challenges and problems. But I
                        believe you can rightfully feel that you have dealt successfully with the
                        burden of events and trends which predate your stewardship; and that you
                        have taken initiatives that moved our policy forward and promise much for
                        the future.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Setting</p>
                    <p>You came to office in the midst of a situation as difficult in its own way as
                        any in our history:</p>
                    <p>—Vietnam and Watergate and the turbulence of a decade had sapped public
                        confidence in our institutions and leaders—and undermined cooperation
                        between Executive and Legislative.</p>
                    <p>—The nation and the world were already moving deeper into the most severe
                        economic down-turn since the Depression.</p>
                    <p>—A legacy of crisis in Indochina, the Middle East, and Cyprus mortgaged the
                        prospects for peace and stability in areas important to us—and resulted in
                        Indochina in the most serious defeat in the history of our foreign
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>—And the circumstances of your accession to office added a unique dimension
                        of difficulty and uncertainty to the task of establishing your Presidential
                        authority and competence here and abroad.</p>
                    <p>These elements combined in a major challenge to our ability to play a
                        purposeful and powerful role abroad.</p>
                    <p>—Doubt and disillusion threatened to turn the American public toward some new
                        form of selfish isolation.</p>
                    <pb n="326" facs="0357" xml:id="pg_326"/>
                    <p>—The strains in our institutions and patterns of authority between Executive
                        and Congress threatened to undermine the coherence and constancy a strong
                        world role requires.</p>
                    <p>—Other nations began to ask themselves whether American strength and
                        leadership would be maintained or steadily decline—and to examine the
                        consequences and options for themselves.</p>
                    <p>This has been the fundamental issue you have had to contend with in your
                        stewardship of foreign policy in the past 12 months. I cannot in all honesty
                        say that it has been laid to rest. But I believe that you can rightfully
                        claim to have weathered the worst of it in the past year and to have brought
                        the nation a considerable distance on the road to new self-confidence.</p>
                    <p>You have had some major assets to work with in this crucial effort.</p>
                    <p>—The basic soundness of the overall structure of our foreign policy, and
                        several important initiatives in the preceding years.</p>
                    <p>—The strong material assets of this nation—military, economic,
                        technological.</p>
                    <p>—Somewhat ironically—the very uncertainty of other nations about our role has
                        been leading them to a fresh appreciation and reaffirmation of their stake
                        in a strong American world presence.</p>
                    <p>—Above all, the strength of the American people. They have displayed once
                        again their basic good sense and steadfastness and a will to sustain a
                        responsible American role abroad.</p>
                    <p>With this said, your leadership has been a critical element in recreating the
                        conditions for effective American leadership. <hi rend="italic"

                        pattern of steady international action that has been felt here and overseas.
                        Your diplomacy and personal contact with the leaders of other nations have
                        established you as a President who will put his own personality and imprint
                        on the conduct of our foreign policy. Certainly other nations are more sure
                        today than they were a year ago that the United States will continue to be a
                        constructive force in world affairs.</p>
                    <p>Finally, your growing strength and authority at home has done much to enhance
                        our ability to conduct an effective policy abroad. This is felt by public
                        and Congress alike, and perceived abroad.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Record</p>
                    <p>Against this background, the measure both of what has been achieved in your
                        first year in office and what remains to be done can be grouped under four
                        broad headings.</p>
                    <p>—Resolving crises that threaten war and jeopardize important policies and
                        positions.</p>
                    <p>—Enhancing our basic alliance relationships.</p>
                    <p>—Pursuing détente with potential adversaries.</p>
                    <p>—Meeting the new demands of interdependence and relations with the developing
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Crises:</hi> The inherited crises of Indochina, the Middle
                        East, and Cyprus have each placed special burdens on our foreign policy in
                        the past year.</p>
                    <p>—The collapse of <hi rend="italic">Indochina</hi> certainly hurt us here and
                        abroad. Yet the country has not been deeply torn by the denouement. Nor have
                        other nations seen in it the end—or even the beginning of the end—of a
                        powerful and purposeful American presence on the world scene. If the
                        Indochina collapse has not taken on these proportions, it is in good part
                        because of the steadiness and firmness you conveyed in the face of it—and
                        the sense that the collapse was a legacy stretching back for more than a
                        decade and precipitated in part by Congress’ action on aid. Our reassuring
                        public pronouncements and your talks with many Asian leaders, as well as the
                        passage of time, have calmed the Asian scene since the early days of deep
                        concern. With this said, no nation can absorb a defeat of the proportions of
                        Indochina and assume that it will not raise questions and affect attitudes
                        in the minds of others, particularly in Asia. This will place a continuing
                        premium on steadiness and forcefulness in asserting our purposes and
                        protecting our interests in Asia and elsewhere in the months ahead.</p>
                    <p>—In the <hi rend="italic">Middle East</hi> it is no small achievement to have
                        had another year of peace for the area and time to continue the hard pursuit
                        of negotiating progress. We suffered a setback this spring in our efforts to
                        negotiate a third Arab-Israeli disengagement agreement. But we now have a
                        chance for one that would carry us a step further toward peace and stability
                        in the area and give us time to work for more progress. You have established
                        yourself with both Arabs—particularly <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                            >Sadat</persName>—and Israelis as your own man, one sympathetic to both
                        sides, but firm on your own concept of what is required to bring peace to
                        the area and on your own definition of where America’s interests lie. Indeed
                        your frank and forthright approach—particularly on the Israeli front—is
                        essential in giving us the strength for a constructive role between the two
                        sides.</p>

                        has squeezed us between Greeks and Turks, damaging our political and

                        progress toward a resolution. As you know, the action of Congress on aid to
                        Turkey has deprived us of our most meaningful lever for progress. Your own
                        direct efforts with the Congress—which are now bearing fruit—are essential

                        your many personal meetings with European leaders helped enhance the
                        solidarity of the Alliance. Our allies were, in fact, much reassured by the
                        strong stance you took on our stake in the continuing vitality of the
                        Transatlantic connection and the agenda you sketched for our common action.
                        Your participation in the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> Summit will
                        afford us an opportunity to reassert our intent to continue a constructive
                        role in European security and in the process of building détente and
                        stability on the continent. Our biggest alliance problem, of course, is the
                        Southern Flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> where serious
                        trends and uncertainties have set in and we cannot control events.</p>
                    <p>—We have also moved in the past year to put our crucial relationship with <hi
                            rend="italic">Japan</hi> on a more confident and mature footing. Your
                        visit to Japan in November, 1974,<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">

                        to the Japanese in establishing our will to enhance our relationship. I
                        believe it helped consolidate Japanese confidence in us and our commitment
                        in a manner that mitigated the effects of the subsequent events in Vietnam.
                        The speech I made on your behalf on June 18,<note n="5" xml:id="d60fn5">

                        the road we have traveled with the Japanese in enhancing our relationship
                        and an agenda for common action. The Miki visit next month and the Emperor’s
                        October visit will give us an opportunity to make progress.</p>

                    <p>—Your trip to <hi rend="italic">South Korea</hi> also served to reaffirm our
                        commitment to that nation. South Korea has been rocked hardest by the
                        Indochina collapse. The growing debate in this country over Park’s
                        repressive practices both adds to the problem and hampers our ability to
                        deal with it. We have moved to reassure the Koreans but we have a serious
                        problem brewing on the Hill. The Korean peninsula remains however the single
                        most dangerous area in Asia.</p>
                    <p>Our effort to establish a new <hi rend="italic">hemispheric dialogue</hi> has
                        been complicated by the impact on our relations of the new economic and
                        political demands of the developing countries; and by specific problems in
                        our bilateral relations. On the latter front, a successful outcome to the
                        Panama negotiation will require a major effort with Congress. If we fail, we
                        face a possible insurgency in Panama and severe problems throughout the
                        hemisphere. As for Cuba, we have succeeded in limiting the damage the issue
                        has caused to hemispheric relations without moving too far ahead of opinion
                        in this country. We have at the same time been conditioning public opinion
                        for any new turn in our bilateral relations and are well positioned for this
                        vis-à-vis Castro.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Adversaries:</hi> We have consolidated and advanced
                        détente with the Soviet Union in the face of substantial uncertainty and
                        pressure. And we have kept our lines open to China—lines we will be pursuing
                        in your visit later this year.</p>
                    <p>—Your Vladivostok meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> established your authority and personal relations
                        with the Soviet leaders and settled the main outlines for a <gloss

                            >See <ref target="#d48fn6">footnote 6, Document 48</ref>.</note> We are
                        now reasonably well placed to secure this agreement and advance our
                        relationship in <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>’s visit
                        here. This autumn we will also very likely engage the Soviets in a serious
                        search for an <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> agreement with the
                        tabling of our nuclear proposal. The absence of a viable alternative to
                        détente gives us strength in dealing with the criticism that is heard across
                        the political spectrum. But the backlash on détente from both left and right
                        is serious and could hamper support for measures such as reopening the
                            <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss> and credits issue as well as the
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement.</p>
                    <p>—On China policy, we have essentially been on a plateau in our relations. The
                        most important factor in our position with the Chinese and in the success of
                        your visit will be their perception of our strength and steadfastness which
                        they value as a counterweight to Soviet power. The international scene is
                        much more important to them than the Taiwan issue, and they seem even more
                        nervous about Moscow in the wake of the Indochina debacle. There will be
                        some domestic criticism here over <pb n="330" facs="0361" xml:id="pg_330"
                        />the lack of spectacular results from your trip but this should be
                        manageable.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Interdependence and Developing Countries:</hi> This has
                        been one of the most ground-breaking and creative areas in our foreign
                        policy in the last year.</p>
                    <p>—The International Energy Agency is a landmark in institution-building among
                        the developed countries and a new dimension of solidarity in our relations
                        with Europe and Japan. The momentum in <gloss target="#t_IEA_1">IEA</gloss>
                        is slowing down, however, and our own domestic disarray on energy policy is
                        hurting us. We have jointly taken steps to reduce our vulnerability to
                            <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> actions, including agreements on
                        emergency oil-sharing and a financial safety net. But much remains to be
                        settled, including agreement on cooperative development of alternative
                        energy supplies and the floor price. On a broader front, both in your
                        bilateral contacts and in the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>
                        context, we have begun better coordination of economic policies among the
                        developed countries to enhance prospects for growth and stability.</p>
                    <p>—After one false start, the producer/consumer dialogue is beginning to get
                        back on track as the result of a U.S. initiative. Our proposal for three
                        commissions—dealing with oil, raw materials, and development—has achieved a
                        large measure of acceptance, but there are still some differences,
                        particularly over the linkage of the commissions to an overall conference
                        and whether to discuss monetary matters. Our objectives in the dialogue are
                        to build a web of mutual interests with the producers, particularly the
                        Saudis and Iranis. Our good bilateral relations with those two countries and
                        our negotiating role in the Middle East should help us. However, our overall
                        strategy could be threatened by a sharp <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"

                    <p>—At the World Food Conference in 1974 we framed the international agenda for
                        dealing with food problems.<note n="7" xml:id="d60fn7">See <ref

                        aid, on a fertilizer institute, and on aid to food production in LDCs. A
                        critical element of our policy, negotiation of a grain reserves agreement
                        may lag because the European Community wants the negotiations in the context
                        of the multilateral trade negotiations in Geneva while we want separate
                        negotiations in London.</p>
                    <p>—On relations with developing countries generally, we have moved steadily to
                        show our sympathy to their aspirations and our resolve to work toward
                        practical and mutually beneficial solutions to problems that make our
                        relations difficult, such as raw materials. At the same time, we have drawn

                            took place September 1–16 and focused on global development and economic
                            issues. During a June 17 meeting with Senators and Department of State
                            officials, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> explained
                            the purpose of the session: “This involves our policies toward the Third
                            World and the politics of the interdependence. The Third World countries
                            have escalated their economic concerns into a political confrontation.
                            There is a danger we will be confronted in the Session by rigid
                            ideological positions. We probably can’t completely avoid confrontation,
                            but in any case we will try hard. We intend to obtain the cooperation of
                            the Third World in the fields of food and raw materials and perhaps even
                            energy. The problem calls for recognition that we all live in the same
                            world and that we could destroy each other by policies which pursue
                            narrow national interests.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1"

                        policy—and the General Assembly itself will be up against our clear warning
                        of the damage to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> of irresponsible

                    <p>—Finally, a problem of world concern is potential proliferation of nuclear
                        weapons particularly among developing countries. We have made some progress
                        toward multilateral agreement among major nuclear exporters to enhance the
                        effectiveness of export controls and safeguards and to exercise restraint in
                        particularly sensitive regional situations. But the spread of nuclear
                        technology (spurred by the energy crisis) and political aspirations combine
                        to make nuclear proliferation one of the largest problems of the coming

                    <p>In sum, this has been a year of solid accomplishments in foreign policy. Yet
                        as always much remains to be done and much could go wrong—and this deserves
                        to be underscored:</p>
                    <p>—relations between executive and congress will continue to be a major problem
                        and a key area for constant effort.</p>
                    <p>—the Middle East could erupt at almost any time with devastating global
                        impact.</p>
                    <p>—instability and tension threatens the southern flank of <gloss

                        events is worrisome.</p>
                    <p>—we face a backlash on détente that could assume proportions that would
                        seriously handicap our ability to pursue the policies.</p>
                    <p>—we face a difficult challenge in the new—and in important aspects
                        unrealistic—demands of the developing countries for power and participation
                        in the world political and economic order.</p>
                    <p>With this said, I think we are emerging from the past year with restored
                        momentum, validating the overall structure of our foreign policy, and laying
                        the foundation for future accomplishments.</p>

                        is fair—and I want to be frank: we have those on the right as well as on the
                        left, who for various reasons, political and otherwise, would like to
                        undermine what we have tried to implement and to destroy détente.</p>

                        negotiations, the documents we will sign here, are pluses, and I am
                        confident as we talk about <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, we can
                        achieve success in this area. Perhaps as in our country, you have some
                        critics in your own government who don’t believe that Vladivostok, <gloss

                            >SALT</gloss> II are in the best interests of your country. But I can
                        tell you in my term of office—and I expect that to be the next 5½ years—my
                        aim, objective and total effort on my part will be to narrow our differences
                        and achieve the benefits for your people, for our people, and I believe for
                        the world as a whole.</p>

                        not stop at that. We should make further headway. Relaxation of tensions
                        doesn’t stop with Europe, the U.S. and Canada. We should extend further.
                        Maybe we should talk about that. I think it was you who said détente is
                        useful not only for Europe but for all the world, and I certainly associate

                        were impressed with the very frank discussions they had with you on energy,
                        economy, trade and other areas. Their impression was that there are distinct
                        possibilities for cooperation in these areas. And I was greatly impressed by
                        the hospitality extended by you and your associates during that visit and
                        the frankness and spirit of cooperation with which these were discussed at

                        and I said “You are not bold enough. You are obviously referring to the

                        he admitted: “It was me.” It was Senator Javits, and we then had an

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No. I knew about your
                        meeting. You presented some figures to the Senators in that meeting.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>: I have some figures on

                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Let me say on that point, Mr.
                        General Secretary. I have indicated to you that I intend to submit
                        legislation as to trade and also as to credits. The handling of Congress is
                        a very delicate problem. As you know, it is dominated in our system by the
                        opposition party, so I have influence but not necessarily control. So the
                        matter of timing when to submit legislation on trade and credits is very
                        important. It is my hope this fall to submit remedial amendments so that we
                        can have trade relations as initially contemplated. I think it was very
                        unfortunate that you were forced to cancel the trade agreement,<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d61fn5">See <ref target="#d31">Document 31</ref>.</note>
                        although I understand the action in Congress might have compelled you to do
                        this. Perhaps by some appropriate action you could help me convince the
                        Congress to approve the changes we will recommend. That would be a very
                        important step, so détente can proceed and we can move in trade relations
                        forward as we anticipated in a constructive way.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Mr. President, on the
                        whole let me say, there has been no change in our policy. We want as before
                        to have good relations with the United States.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Mr. General Secretary, a few
                        moments ago you said you had some figures in mind to discuss. I would be

                        <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>: I will look. I do have
                        somewhere a brief on this question. We have already added <persName

                        are some data. In 1972—the first figures are the number of requests for exit
                        permits—in 1972, there were 26,800 requests. In 1973, there were
                        approximately 26,000. In 1974, there were 14,000. In the first six months of
                        1975, there were 5,000 requests to leave.</p>
                    <p>As regards the number of people who actually left for Israel—actually some
                        went elsewhere—in 1972, there were 29,000. In 1973, 33,000. In 1974, 19,000.
                        And in the first six months of 1975, 6,000. Some were carryovers from the
                        past year; there were only 5,000 requests.</p>
                    <p>I have another figure. From the start of the emigration of Jews from the
                        Soviet Union, which dates back to 1945, until July 1, 1975, a total of <pb
                            n="336" facs="0367" xml:id="pg_336"/>116,000 persons left the Soviet
                        Union. This amounts to 98.4 percent of all requests submitted, 98.4 percent
                        were met. You see, at present there is a process of falling off of requests,
                        and probably it will continue. In your country, there are some to whom you
                        don’t give permission on security grounds; we also have such people.</p>

                        are very severe critics of the policy I and you believe in, détente. Senator

                        President of the American Federation of Labor, have spoken out critically.
                        Meany has embraced Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Solzhenitsyn</persName>.
                        Some of these critics encouraged Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2"

                        firm belief that détente must continue and become irreversible if we want to
                        achieve that kind of world which is essential for peace. The figures you
                        mentioned, of course, are very disappointing to those who criticize détente.
                        And any improvement there—in the requests or the figures of those who get
                        permission to leave—would undercut some of the criticism and enhance our
                        ability to proceed with détente as we want to do. But I repeat: détente can
                        and will work and can be made irreversible—particularly if this Saturday we
                        can make headway on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>: I mentioned <persName
                            corresp="#p_SA_2">Solzhenitsyn</persName> just in passing. There was
                        some information that he wanted to change his way of life and become a monk
                        or something. Reportedly there was some priest going around with him at some
                        point. He is nothing more than a zero for the Soviet Union. But why do you
                        feel these figures will be disappointing to the people you mentioned?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: In the case of Senator Javits,
                        and Senator <persName corresp="#p_RAA_1">Ribicoff</persName>, they want to
                        be helpful in Congress to approve the legislation I want to recommend,
                        legislation that will permit trade, to extend credits, that will be very
                        beneficial. If the figures were more encouraging, Mr. General Secretary,
                        they would provide them with arguments for revising legislation that was so
                        harmful to the continuation of détente.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>: Mr. President, maybe you
                        didn’t understand me correctly. I said we are reaching the point where there
                        will be a tragedy. But what are we to do? Start talking people into leaving?
                        I merely made a factual statement: The number of applications has been
                        decreasing. <pb n="337" facs="0368" xml:id="pg_337"/>The number of
                        applications we have been receiving since I was in Washington has been
                        declining. I am sure you and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> realize this is so. I know virtually dozens of
                        people of Jewish origin. Am I to go to Dymshits, the Deputy Prime Minister
                        of the Soviet Union, and say “You’ve got to leave?” And Leibman of the
                        Moscow Soviet—should I grab him by the hand and tell him to go?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Certainly the figure of 98
                        percent is a good record.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>: Ninety-eight point four
                        percent.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: That is certainly a good
                        batting average, as we say in the United States. I am not suggesting ways
                        for increasing the number of applications. All I want to say is that
                            <persName corresp="#p_RAA_1">Ribicoff</persName>, Javits and others must
                        be made to understand that if the revised legislation is adopted, there will
                        be the possibility, if not the certainty—that the figures will be like those
                        of 1974 or 1973. I understand you can’t take people by the hand and tell
                        them to leave, but the perception, the appearance, makes a difference.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName>: I really can’t understand
                        what I can do in this regard.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Let me summarize the situation
                        as I see it from the point of view of détente. I came here, Mr. General
                        Secretary, despite the criticism in the United States, because I believe in
                        détente. The portions I have been connected with—Vladivostok and here—have
                        been concrete forward steps, meaningful progress. As I said, the criticism
                        at home has come from elements in America that can be, as I said, brushed
                        aside. Coming here will contribute to détente despite the détente critics. I
                        hope we will achieve in Helsinki what we talked about in Vladivostok.
                        Thinking people in the U.S. know that Vladivostok was a success which serves
                        the interests of both sides. The American people, the majority of the
                        population, hopes for more progress. The majority feels the same way about
                        this conference, and the implementation of the document we sign will be the
                        most conclusive proof that we are on the right track. So I hope we can make
                        progress in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. This will be a good
                        preliminary discussion for what we discuss on Saturday. But I repeat with
                        quiet emphasis, détente must be made irreversible. It was my conviction at
                        Vladivostok. I hope we can leave Helsinki with the same feeling, leading
                        hopefully to a visit by you to the United States this fall.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here are the President’s introductory remarks.]</p>
                    <p>I have not come across the Atlantic to say what all of us already know—that
                        nations now have the capacity to destroy civilization and, therefore, all
                        our foreign policies must have as their one supreme objective the prevention
                        of a thermonuclear war. Nor have I come to dwell upon the hard realities of
                        continuing ideological differences, political rivalries, and military
                        competition that persist among us.</p>
                    <p>I have come to Helsinki as a spokesman for a nation whose vision has always
                        been forward, whose people have always demanded that the future be brighter
                        than the past, and whose united will and purpose at this hour is to work
                        diligently to promote peace and progress not only for ourselves but for all
                        mankind.</p>
                    <p>I am simply here to say to my colleagues: We owe it to our children, to the
                        children of all continents, not to miss any opportunity, not to malinger for
                        one minute, not to spare ourselves or allow others to shirk in the
                        monumental task of building a better and a safer world.</p>
                    <p>The American people, like the people of Europe, know well that mere
                        assertions of good will, passing changes in the political mood of
                        governments, laudable declarations of principles are not enough. But if we
                        proceed with care, with commitment to real progress, there is now an
                        opportunity to turn our peoples’ hopes into realities.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, nations represented here have sought to ease potential
                        conflicts. But much more remains to be done before we prematurely
                        congratulate ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Military competition must be controlled. Political competition must be
                        restrained. Crises must not be manipulated or exploited for unilateral
                        advantages that could lead us again to the brink of war. The process of
                        negotiation must be sustained, not at a snail’s pace, but with demonstrated
                        enthusiasm and visible progress.</p>
                    <p>Nowhere are the challenges and the opportunities greater and more evident
                        than in Europe. That is why this Conference brings us all <pb n="339"
                            facs="0370" xml:id="pg_339"/>together. Conflict in Europe shakes the
                        world. Twice in this century we have paid dearly for this lesson; at other
                        times, we have come perilously close to calamity. We dare not forget the
                        tragedy and the terror of those times.</p>
                    <p>Peace is not a piece of paper.</p>
                    <p>But lasting peace is at least possible today because we have learned from the
                        experiences of the last 30 years that peace is a process requiring mutual
                        restraint and practical arrangements.</p>
                    <p>This Conference is a part of that process—a challenge, not a conclusion. We
                        face unresolved problems of military security in Europe; we face them with
                        very real differences in values and in aims. But if we deal with them with
                        careful preparation, if we focus on concrete issues, if we maintain forward
                        movement, we have the right to expect real progress.</p>
                    <p>The era of confrontation that has divided Europe since the end of the Second
                        World War may now be ending. There is a new perception and a shared
                        perception of a change for the better, away from confrontation and toward
                        new possibilities for secure and mutually beneficial cooperation. That is
                        what we all have been saying here. I welcome and I share these hopes for the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The postwar policy of the United States has been consistently directed toward
                        the rebuilding of Europe and the rebirth of Europe’s historic identity. The
                        nations of the West have worked together for peace and progress throughout
                        Europe. From the very start, we have taken the initiative by stating clear
                        goals and areas for negotiation.</p>
                    <p>We have sought a structure of European relations, tempering rivalry with
                        restraint, power with moderation, building upon the traditional bonds that
                        link us with old friends and reaching out to forge new ties with former and
                        potential adversaries.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, there have been some substantial achievements.</p>
                    <p>We see the Four-Power Agreement on Berlin of 1971 as the end of a perennial
                        crisis that on at least three occasions brought the world to the brink of
                        doom.</p>
                    <p>The agreements between the Federal Republic of Germany and the states of
                        Eastern Europe and the related intra-German accords enable Central Europe
                        and the world to breathe easier.</p>
                    <p>The start of East-West talks on mutual and balanced force reductions
                        demonstrate a determination to deal with military security problems of the
                        continent.</p>
                    <p>The 1972 treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union to limit
                        antiballistic missiles and the interim agreement limiting strategic
                        offensive arms were the first solid breakthroughs in what must be a
                        continuing, long-term process of limiting strategic nuclear arsenals.</p>
                    <pb n="340" facs="0371" xml:id="pg_340"/>
                    <p>I profoundly hope that this Conference will spur further practical and
                        concrete results. It affords a welcome opportunity to widen the circle of
                        those countries involved in easing tensions between East and West.</p>
                    <p>Participation in the work of détente and participation in the benefits of
                        détente must be everybody’s business—in Europe and elsewhere. But détente
                        can succeed only if everybody understands what détente actually is.</p>
                    <p>First, détente is an evolutionary process, not a static condition. Many
                        formidable challenges yet remain.</p>
                    <p>Second, the success of détente, of the process of détente, depends on new
                        behavior patterns that give life to all our solemn declarations. The goals
                        we are stating today are the yardstick by which our performance will be
                        measured.</p>
                    <p>The people of all Europe and, I assure you, the people of North America are
                        thoroughly tired of having their hopes raised and then shattered by empty
                        words and unfulfilled pledges. We had better say what we mean and mean what
                        we say, or we will have the anger of our citizens to answer.</p>
                    <p>While we must not expect miracles, we can and we do expect steady progress
                        that comes in steps—steps that are related to each other that link our
                        actions with words in various areas of our relations.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there must be an acceptance of mutual obligation. Détente, as I have
                        often said, must be a two-way street. Tensions cannot be eased by one side
                        alone. Both sides must want détente and work to achieve it. Both sides must
                        benefit from it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chairman, my colleagues, this extraordinary gathering in Helsinki proves
                        that all our peoples share a concern for Europe’s future and for a better
                        and more peaceful world. But what else does it prove? How shall we assess
                        the results?</p>
                    <p>Our delegations have worked long and hard to produce documents which restate
                        noble and praiseworthy political principles. They spell out guidelines for
                        national behavior and international cooperation.<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2"
                            >Reference is to the <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> Final Act,
                            comprised of four “baskets” or categories. For the text of the Final

                            during an August 8 Cabinet meeting, noting: “All the new things in the
                            document are in our favor—peaceful change, human contacts, maneuver
                            notification. At the Conference, it was the President who dominated the
                            Conference and it was the West which was on the offensive.” For the full

                    <p>But every signatory should know that if these are to be more than the latest
                        chapter in a long and sorry volume of unfulfilled declarations, every party
                        must be dedicated to making them come true.</p>
                    <p>These documents which we will sign represent another step—how long or short a
                        step only time will tell—in the process of détente and reconcilation in
                        Europe. Our peoples will be watching and measuring our progress. They will
                        ask how these noble sentiments are being translated into actions that bring
                        about a more secure and just order in the daily lives of each of our nations
                        and its citizens.</p>
                    <p>The documents produced here represent compromises, like all international
                        negotiations, but these principles we have agreed upon are more than the
                        lowest common denominator of governmental positions.</p>
                    <p>They affirm the most fundamental human rights: liberty of thought,
                        conscience, and faith; the exercise of civil and political rights; the
                        rights of minorities.</p>
                    <p>They call for a freer flow of information, ideas, and people; greater scope
                        for the press, cultural and educational exchange, family reunification, the
                        right to travel and to marriage between nationals of different states; and
                        for the protection of the priceless heritage of our diverse cultures.</p>
                    <p>They offer wide areas for greater cooperation: trade, industrial production,
                        science and technology, the environment, transportation, health, space, and
                        the oceans.</p>
                    <p>They reaffirm the basic principles of relations between states:
                        nonintervention, sovereign equality, self-determination, territorial
                        integrity, inviolability of frontiers, and the possibility of change by
                        peaceful means.</p>
                    <p>The United States gladly subscribes to this document because we subscribe to
                        every one of these principles.</p>
                    <p>Almost 200 years ago, the United States of America was born as a free and
                        independent nation. The descendants of Europeans who proclaimed their
                        independence in America expressed in that declaration a decent respect for
                        the opinions of mankind and asserted not only that all men are created equal
                        but they are endowed with inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the
                        pursuit of happiness.</p>
                    <p>The founders of my country did not merely say that all Americans should have
                        these rights but all men everywhere should have these rights. And these
                        principles have guided the United States of America throughout its two
                        centuries of nationhood. They have given hopes to millions in Europe and on
                        every continent.</p>
                    <p>I have been asked why I am here today.</p>
                    <pb n="342" facs="0373" xml:id="pg_342"/>
                    <p>I am here because I believe, and my countrymen believe, in the
                        interdependence of Europe and North America—indeed in the interdependence of
                        the entire family of man.</p>
                    <p>I am here because the leaders of 34 other governments are here—the states of
                        Europe and of our good neighbor, Canada, with whom we share an open border
                        of 5,526 miles, along which there stands not a single armed soldier and
                        across which our two peoples have moved in friendship and mutual respect for
                        160 years.</p>
                    <p>I can say without fear of contradiction that there is not a single people
                        represented here whose blood does not flow in the veins of Americans and
                        whose culture and traditions have not enriched the heritage which we
                        Americans prize so highly.</p>
                    <p>When two centuries ago the United States of America issued a declaration of
                        high principles, the cynics and doubters of that day jeered and scoffed. Yet
                        11 long years later, our independence was won and the stability of our
                        Republic was really achieved through the incorporation of the same
                        principles in our Constitution.</p>
                    <p>But those principles, though they are still being perfected, remain the
                        guiding lights of an American policy. And the American people are still
                        dedicated, as they were then, to a decent respect for the opinions of
                        mankind and to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all peoples
                        everywhere.</p>
                    <p>To our fellow participants in this Conference: My presence here symbolizes my
                        country’s vital interest in Europe’s future. Our future is bound with yours.
                        Our economic well-being, as well as our security, is linked increasingly
                        with yours. The distance of geography is bridged by our common heritage and
                        our common destiny. The United States, therefore, intends to participate
                        fully in the affairs of Europe and in turning the results of this Conference
                        into a living reality.</p>
                    <p>To America’s allies: We in the West must vigorously pursue the course upon
                        which we have embarked together, reinforced by one another’s strength and
                        mutual confidence. Stability in Europe requires equilibrium in Europe.
                        Therefore, I assure you that my country will continue to be a concerned and
                        reliable partner. Our partnership is far more than a matter of formal
                        agreements. It is a reflection of beliefs, traditions, and ties that are of
                        deep significance to the American people. We are proud that these values are
                        expressed in this document.</p>
                    <p>To the countries of the East: The United States considers that the principles
                        on which this Conference has agreed are a part of the great heritage of
                        European civilization, which we all hold in trust for all mankind. To my
                        country, they are not cliches or empty phrases. We take this work and these
                        words very seriously. We will spare no effort to ease tensions and to solve
                        problems between us. But it is important that you recognize the deep
                        devotion of the American people and their <pb n="343" facs="0374"

                        thus to the pledges that this Conference has made regarding the freer
                        movement of people, ideas, information.</p>
                    <p>In building a political relationship between East and West, we face many
                        challenges.</p>
                    <p>Berlin has a special significance. It has been a flashpoint of confrontation
                        in the past; it can provide an example of peaceful settlement in the future.
                        The United States regards it as a test of détente and of the principles of
                        this Conference. We welcome the fact that, subject to Four-Power rights and
                        responsibilities, the results of <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>
                        apply to Berlin as they do throughout Europe.</p>
                    <p>Military stability in Europe has kept the peace. While maintaining that
                        stability, it is now time to reduce substantially the high levels of
                        military forces on both sides. Negotiations now underway in Vienna on mutual
                        and balanced force reductions so far have not produced the results for which
                        I had hoped. The United States stands ready to demonstrate flexibility in
                        moving these negotiations forward, if others will do the same. An agreement
                        that enhances mutual security is feasible—and essential.</p>
                    <p>The United States also intends to pursue vigorously a further agreement on
                        strategic arms limitations with the Soviet Union. This remains a priority of
                        American policy. General Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> and I agreed last November in Vladivostok on the
                        essentials of a new accord limiting strategic offensive weapons for the next
                        10 years. We are moving forward in our bilateral discussions here in
                        Helsinki.</p>
                    <p>The world faces an unprecedented danger in the spread of nuclear weapons
                        technology. The nations of Europe share a great responsibility for an
                        international solution to this problem. The benefits of peaceful nuclear
                        energy are becoming more and more important. We must find ways to spread
                        these benefits while safeguarding the world against the menace of weapons
                        proliferation.</p>
                    <p>To the other nations of Europe represented at this Conference: We value the
                        work you have done here to help bring all of Europe together. Your right to
                        live in peace and independence is one of the major goals of our effort. Your
                        continuing contribution will be indispensable.</p>
                    <p>To those nations not participating and to all the peoples of the world: The
                        solemn obligation undertaken in these documents to promote fundamental
                        rights, economic and social progress, and well-being applies ultimately to
                        all peoples.</p>
                    <p>Can we truly speak of peace and security without addressing the spread of
                        nuclear weapons in the world or the creation of more sophisticated forms of
                        warfare?</p>
                    <p>Can peace be divisible between areas of tranquillity and regions of
                        conflict?</p>
                    <pb n="344" facs="0375" xml:id="pg_344"/>
                    <p>Can Europe truly flourish if we do not all address ourselves to the evil of
                        hunger in countries less fortunate than we? To the new dimensions of
                        economic and energy issues that underline our own progress? To the dialog
                        between producers and consumers, between exporters and importers, between
                        industrial countries and less developed ones?</p>
                    <p>And can there be stability and progress in the absence of justice and
                        fundamental freedoms?</p>
                    <p>Our people want a better future. Their expectations have been raised by the
                        very real steps that have already been taken—in arms control, political
                        negotiations, and expansion of contacts and economic relations. Our presence
                        here offers them further hope. We must not let them down.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviet Union and the United States can reach agreement so that our
                        astronauts can fit together the most intricate scientific equipment, work
                        together, and shake hands 137 miles out in space,<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3"

                    <p>History will judge this Conference not by what we say here today, but by what
                        we do tomorrow—not by the promises we make, but by the promises we keep.</p>

                    <p>We face a curious paradox: our relations with Latin America have improved
                        significantly in the past 18 months—yet the renewed “inter-<pb n="345"

                            January 14 entitled “Why Has the New Dialogue Soured?” Characterizing
                            the New Dialogue as “old wine in new bottles,” Lord and <persName

                            U.S. initiatives, it aroused some expectations which could not be met,
                            at least in the short term. The New Dialogue was launched by a unique
                            Secretary of State, one who had just assumed office fresh from enormous
                            foreign policy triumphs. You asked the Latin Americans to tell you what
                            was wrong with U.S. policy. They had fantasies that you would work some
                            special magic to set wrongs aright. Culturally predisposed to believe in
                            heroic leaders, the Latin Americans did not understand that in our
                            political system foreign policy issues increasingly involve a
                            process—usually lengthy—of negotiation and compromise between two
                            branches and two parties.” (Library of Congress, Manuscript Division,

                    <p>Underlying this paradox, we believe, is the fact that <hi rend="italic"
                            >regionalism can no longer serve as the primary focus of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Latin American relations.</hi> Our
                        inability to translate generally positive bilateral relationships into a
                        similarly positive regional environment stems from the ambiguity of the
                        “special relationship” between Latin America and the United States, and the
                        hemisphere’s growing diversity. So long as we approach Latin America
                        primarily as a unit, we will engender a suspicious common front against
                        us—and diversity will paralyze action.</p>
                    <p>This is not an insoluble dilemma. Regionalism does provide a convenient mode
                        of interaction with the smaller countries and is an unavoidable and
                        convenient rationale for specific initiatives. As a practical matter,
                        however, the increasingly varied interests of the hemisphere’s more powerful
                        countries—including our own—requires a mix of relationships tailored to
                        specific needs and situations, most of which are not susceptible to
                        “regional” solutions. Two of the most striking developments of the past
                        decade—the rise of sub-regional politics and the proliferation of
                        extra-hemispheric linkages—are a direct reflection of the growing industrial
                        power and diversification of key countries, particularly Brazil and Mexico,
                        which is driving them to seek capital, technology and markets in a manner
                        reminiscent of 19th century European competitions.</p>
                    <p>The implication is clear: <hi rend="italic">we should approach individual
                            countries and groups of countries in Latin America in a differentiated
                            fashion, placing greater emphasis on bilateral and sub-regional
                            relationships, and attempting whenever possible to implement our global
                            economic policies in a way that will engage Latin America’s new middle
                            powers in productive commercial relationships and contain the inevitable
                            conflicts their global emergence will entail.</hi>

                    <p>This conclusion is more easily stated than implemented. The classic
                        instrumentalities of bilateralism in the hemisphere—<gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> military and economic assistance programs—are not only
                        declining and hedged with restrictions, but are either inappropriate or
                        simply unavailable. The three countries where our interests are greatest:
                        Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela, are rightly no longer eligible for
                        concessional <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> programs, just as they
                        have received no grant military equipment since 1968. <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> responsiveness to their clamor for “trade,
                        not aid” has been limited by competing domestic and international pressures.
                        But we have also limited ourselves conceptually by searching for nonexistent
                        “regional” solutions.</p>
                    <p>We thus face in Latin America a situation similar to the one you described in

                    <p>On November 9, 1975, President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald
                            Ford</persName> participated in an interview marking the 28th
                        anniversary of the <gloss target="#t_NBC_1">NBC</gloss> news program “Meet
                        the Press.” During the course of the interview, conducted by host <persName
                            corresp="#p_SL_1">Lawrence Spivak</persName>, the President was asked to
                        provide his definition of détente and an explanation of what détente
                        personally meant to him and what it should mean to the American public.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> responded:</p>
                    <p>“I am not sure that is the best word but that is the word that is being used.
                        Détente means to me that two super powers who are strong militarily and
                        economically, who represent differing political and governmental views,
                        instead of confronting one another, can consult one another on a wide
                        variety of areas of potential dispute, whether it is trade, whether it is
                        military potential conflict, whether it is a number of other things.</p>
                    <p>“Now, détente is not always going to mean that we solve every problem,
                        because some of them are very complex and very controversial. It does mean
                        it is a mechanism for the relaxation of tension, so that instead of glaring
                        at one another and opening the potential of conflict, you can sit down and
                        discuss differences of opinion and hope to accomplish a relaxation and
                        progress without military conflict.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers:

                    <p>Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName>
                        echoed these themes during a November 24 speech delivered in Detroit,
                        Michigan. Addressing the Economic Club of Detroit and other local groups,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> proposed to discuss
                        “what is right with America’s foreign policy.” Highlighting the diplomatic
                        successes of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administrations, <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted a sea change in U.S-Soviet
                        relations: “In place of continual crises there are continuing
                        negotiations—on arms control, economic relations, and international
                        issues—which give both sides a stake in <pb n="348" facs="0379"
                            xml:id="pg_348"/>peace and have lessened the chances that great-power
                        confrontation will lead to nuclear Armageddon.”</p>
                    <p>However, new realities threatened to complicate détente, <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> acknowledged, including the
                        three-party competition for political control of the former Portuguese
                        colony of Angola: the Popular Front for the Liberation of Angola (<gloss
                            target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>) backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba,
                        the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                            >FNLA</gloss>) supported by China and Zaire (although the <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administration also backed <gloss
                            target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> leader Holden Roberto), and the
                        U.S.-supported National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (<gloss
                            target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>). Continued <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:</p>
                    <p>“But the easing of tensions cannot endure if we relax our vigilance. We must
                        understand the need for both defense <hi rend="italic">and</hi> relaxation
                        of tension, both firm action in crises <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
                        willingness to resolve problems on a realistic and fair basis. We must be
                        prepared for either course; the choice rests with our adversaries.</p>
                    <p>“We cannot ignore, for example, the substantial Soviet buildup of weapons in
                        Angola, which has introduced great-power rivalry into Africa for the first
                        time in 15 years. This Soviet involvement is resented by African nations
                        most of all. But the United States cannot be indifferent while an outside
                        power embarks upon an interventionist policy—so distant from its homeland
                        and so removed from traditional Russian interests. The Soviet Union still
                        has an opportunity for a policy of restraint which permits Angolans to
                        resolve their own differences without outside intervention. We would be glad
                        to cooperate in such a course. But time is running out; continuation of an
                        interventionist policy must inevitably threaten other relationships.</p>
                    <p>“Nor can we ignore the thousands of Cubans sent into an African conflict. In
                        recent months the United States has demonstrated, by deed as well as word,
                        its readiness to improve relations with Cuba. We have cooperated with steps
                        to ease the inter-American boycott against Cuba and to restore a more normal
                        relationship between the nations of the Americas and Cuba. But let there be
                        no illusions: a policy of conciliation will not survive Cuban meddling in
                        Puerto Rico or Cuban armed intervention in the affairs of other nations
                        struggling to decide their own fate.</p>
                    <p>“To Cuba, as to other nations with whom our relations have been strained, I
                        say this: the United States has no higher goal than to ease the conflicts
                        that have torn the globe for nearly a generation. We will be flexible and
                        cooperative in settling conflicts. But we will never permit détente to turn
                        into a subterfuge for unilateral advantage. The policy of relaxation of
                        tensions is designed to promote peace, not surrender; we will be flexible,
                        but we shall insist on reciprocity and restraint.” For the full text of

                    <p>During the President’s November 26 news conference, reporters asked <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> if the Soviet involvement in Angola
                        was “consistent” with the President’s understanding of détente. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> responded: “I agree with the content
                        of the speech made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> in Detroit last night [November 24], where he said
                        that the Soviet actions in Angola were not helpful in the continuation of
                        détente. I agree with that, and I hope and trust that there will be proper
                        note taken of it.”</p>
                    <p>When asked if he planned to “do anything about it” other than offering the
                        statement, <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> asserted, “I don’t
                        want to get into the method or procedure. I said that I agree with the
                        statement made by the Secretary, and I believe that the Soviet Union is not
                        helping the cause of détente by what they are doing. And I hope the message
                        comes across.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName

                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administration covertly
                        supported <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> during the Angolan civil war.
                        Congressional opposition to this financial support culminated in an
                        amendment to the <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1976 Defense
                        Appropriations bill sponsored by Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1">John
                            Tunney </persName>(D–California), which aimed to terminate the covert
                        support (S. <gloss target="#t_Res_1">Res</gloss>. 337). Despite a compromise
                        approach pursued by <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and
                        members of the Senate leadership, the measure passed the Senate on December
                        19, prompting <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> to comment to
                        reporters: “How can the United States, the greatest power in the world, take
                        the position that the Soviet Union can operate with impunity many thousands
                        of miles away with Cuban troops and massive amounts of military equipment,
                        while we refuse any assistance to the majority of the local people who ask
                        only for military equipment to defend themselves?” (Ibid., page 1981) The
                        next day, <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> touched upon the
                        implications of this decision:</p>
                    <p>“And the problem that I foresee on a broader basis is a good many countries
                        throughout the world consider the United States friendly and helpful, and we
                        have over a period of time helped to maintain free governments around the
                        world. Those countries that have depended on us—and there are many—can’t
                        help but have some misgivings, because the Congress has refused any
                        opportunity for us in Angola to help a majority of the people. And they
                        can’t help but feel that the same fate might occur as far as they are
                        concerned in the future.” (Ibid., page 1986) Despite a last-minute appeal by
                        the <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administration, the House
                        passed the Defense Appropriations Act with the <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1"
                            >Tunney</persName> amendment on January 27, 1976, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> signed it on February 9 (P.L.
                        94–212). His February 10 signing statement reads in part: “I am deeply
                        disappointed that the Congress has acted in this bill to deprive the people
                        of Angola of the assistance needed to resist Soviet and Cuban military
                        intervention in their country. I believe this provision is an extemely
                        undesirable precedent that could limit severely our ability to play a
                        positive and effective role in international affairs.” (Ibid., <pb n="350"

                    <p>[Omitted here are introductory remarks.]</p>
                    <p>But it is good to be home again in the United States. I have just completed,
                        as many of you know, a 7-day trip to the State of Alaska, to the People’s
                        Republic of China, to our good friends Indonesia and the Philippines, and
                        now I am obviously happy to be home in our 50th State, Hawaii.</p>
                    <p>This morning I reflected on the past at the shrine of Americans who died on
                        Sunday morning 34 years ago. I came away with a new spirit of dedication to
                        the ideals that emerged from Pearl Harbor in World War II—dedication to
                        America’s bipartisan policy of pursuing peace through strength and
                        dedication to a new future of interdependence and cooperation with all
                        peoples of the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>I subscribe to a Pacific doctrine of peace with all and hostility toward
                        none. The way I would like to remember or recollect Pearl Harbor is by
                        preserving the power of the past to build the future. Let us join with new
                        and old countries of that great Pacific area in creating the greatest
                        civilization on the shores of the greatest of our oceans.</p>
                    <p>My visit here to the East-West Center holds another kind of meaning. Your
                        center is a catalyst of America’s positive concern for Asia, its people and
                        its rich diversity of cultures. You advance our hope that Asia will gain a
                        better understanding of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Last year we were pleased to receive and to welcome nearly 54,000 Asian
                        students to the United States, while thousands upon thousands of American
                        students went to Asian countries. I applaud your contri<pb n="351"
                            facs="0382" xml:id="pg_351"/>bution to partnership in education. Your
                        efforts represent America’s vision of an open world of understanding,
                        freedom, and peace.</p>
                    <p>In Hawaii, the crossroads of the Pacific, our past and our future join.</p>
                    <p>I was deeply moved when I visited Japan last year and when I recently had the
                        honor of welcoming the Emperor and the Empress of Japan to America.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">The Emperor and Empress visited several U.S.
                            cities September 30–October 15. They were in Washington October
                            2–4.</note> The gracious welcome that I received and the warmth of the
                        welcome the American people bestowed upon the Emperor and the Empress
                        testify to a growing friendship and partnership between our two great
                        countries. This is a tribute to what is best in man—his capacity to grow
                        from fear to trust and from a tragedy of the past to a hopeful future. It is
                        a superb example of what can be achieved in human progress. It inspires our
                        new efforts in Asia to improve relations.</p>
                    <p>America, a nation of the Pacific Basin, has a very vital stake in Asia and a
                        responsibility to take a leading part in lessening tensions, preventing
                        hostilities, and preserving peace. World stability and our own security
                        depend upon our Asian commitments.</p>
                    <p>In 1941, 34 years ago today, we were militarily unprepared. Our trade in the
                        Pacific was very limited. We exercised jurisdiction over the Philippines. We
                        were preoccupied with Western Europe. Our instincts were isolationist.</p>
                    <p>We have transcended that age. We are now the world’s strongest nation. Our
                        great commercial involvement in Asia is expanding. We led the way in
                        conferring independence upon the Philippines. Now we are working out new
                        associations and arrangements with the trust territories of the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>The center of political power in the United States has shifted westward. Our
                        Pacific interests and concerns have increased. We have exchanged the freedom
                        of action of an isolationist state for the responsibilities of a great
                        global power. As I return from this trip to three major Asian countries, I
                        am even more aware of our interests in this part of the world.</p>
                    <p>The security concerns of great world powers intersect in Asia. The United
                        States, the Soviet Union, China, and Japan are all Pacific powers. Western
                        Europe has historic and economic ties with Asia. Equilibrium in the Pacific
                        is absolutely essential to the United States and to the other countries in
                        the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>The first premise of a new Pacific Doctrine is that American strength is
                        basic to any stable balance of power in the Pacific. We must <pb n="352"
                            facs="0383" xml:id="pg_352"/>reach beyond our concern for security. But
                        without security, there can be neither peace nor progress. The preservation
                        of the sovereignty and the independence of our Asian friends and allies
                        remain a paramount objective of American policy.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that force alone is insufficient to assure security. Popular
                        legitimacy and social justice are vital prerequisites of resistance against
                        subversion or aggression. Nevertheless, we owe it to ourselves and to those
                        whose independence depends upon our continued support to preserve a flexible
                        and balanced position of strength throughout the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>The second basic premise of a new Pacific Doctrine is that partnership with
                        Japan is a pillar of our strategy. There is no relationship to which I have
                        devoted more attention, nor is there any greater success story in the
                        history of American efforts to relate to distant cultures and to
                            people.<note n="3" xml:id="d65fn3">During a December 31
                            question-and-answer session with reporters, <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                                >Ford</persName> described the U.S.-Japanese relationship as “the
                            best in the history of this country.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers:

                            II, p. 2002)</note> The Japanese-American relationship can be a source
                        of great, great pride to every American and to every Japanese. Our bilateral
                        relations have never been better. The recent exchange of visits symbolized a
                        basic political partnership. We have begun to develop with the Japanese and
                        other advanced industrial democracies better means of harmonizing our
                        economic policy. We are joining with Japan, our European friends, and
                        representatives of the developing nations this month to begin shaping a more
                        efficient and more equitable pattern of North-South economic relations.</p>
                    <p>The third premise of a new Pacific Doctrine is the normalization of relations
                        with the People’s Republic of China, the strengthening of our new ties with
                        this great nation representing nearly one-quarter of mankind. This is
                        another recent achievement of American foreign policy. It transcends 25
                        years of hostility.</p>
                    <p>I visited China to build on the dialog started nearly 4 years ago. My
                        wide-ranging exchanges with the leaders of the People’s Republic of
                        China—with Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping—enhanced
                        our understanding of each other’s views and each other’s policies.</p>
                    <p>There were, as expected, differences of perspective. Our societies, our
                        philosophies, our varying positions in the world give us differing
                        perceptions of our respective national interests. But we did find a common
                        ground. We reaffirmed that we share very important areas of concern and
                        agreement. They say and we say that the countries of Asia should be free to
                        develop in a world where there is mutual respect for the sovereignty and
                        territorial integrity of all states; where people are <pb n="353"
                            facs="0384" xml:id="pg_353"/>free from the threat of foreign aggression;
                        where there is noninterference in the internal affairs of others; and where
                        the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and coexistence shape the
                        development of peaceful international order. We share opposition to any form
                        of hegemony in Asia or in any other part of the world.</p>
                    <p>I reaffirmed the determination of the United States to complete the
                        normalization of relations with the People’s Republic of China on the basis
                        of the Shanghai communiqué. Both sides regarded our discussions as
                        significant, useful, and constructive. Our relationship is becoming a
                        permanent feature of the international political landscape. It benefits not
                        only our two peoples but all peoples of the region and the entire world.</p>
                    <p>A fourth principle of our Pacific policy is our continuing stake in stability
                        and security in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>After leaving China, I visited Indonesia and the Philippines. Indonesia is a
                        nation of 140 million people, the fifth largest population in the world
                        today. It is one of our important new friends and a major country in that
                        area of the world. The Republic of the Philippines is one of our oldest and
                        dearest allies. Our friendship demonstrates America’s longstanding interest
                        in Asia.</p>
                    <p>I spent 3 days in Djakarta and Manila. I would have liked to have had time to
                        visit our friends in Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia. We share important
                        political and economic concerns with these five nations who make up the
                        Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</p>
                    <p>I can assure you that Americans will be hearing much more about the <gloss
                            target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> organization. All of its members are
                        friends of the United States. Their total population equals our own. While
                        they are developing countries, they possess many, many assets—vital peoples,
                        abundant natural resources, and well-managed agricultures. They have skilled
                        leaders and the determination to develop themselves and to solve their own
                        problems. Each of these countries protects its independence by relying on
                        its own national resilience and diplomacy. We must continue to assist them.
                        I learned during my visit that our friends want us to remain actively
                        engaged in the affairs of the region. We intend to do so.</p>
                    <p>We retain close and valuable ties with our old friends and allies in the
                        Southwest Pacific—Australia on the one hand and New Zealand on the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>A fifth tenet of our new Pacific policy is our belief that peace in Asia
                        depends upon a resolution of outstanding political conflicts.</p>
                    <p>In Korea, tension persists. We have close ties with the Republic of Korea.
                        And we remain committed to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, as
                        the presence of our forces there attests. Responding to the <pb n="354"
                            facs="0385" xml:id="pg_354"/>heightened tension last spring, we
                        reaffirmed our support of the Republic of Korea. Today, the United States is
                        ready to consider constructive ways of easing tensions on the peninsula. But
                        we will continue to resist any moves which attempt to exclude the Republic
                        of Korea from discussion of its own future.</p>
                    <p>In Indochina, the healing effects of time are required. Our policies toward
                        the new regimes of the peninsula will be determined by their conduct toward
                        us. We are prepared to reciprocate gestures of good will—particularly the
                        return of remains of Americans killed or missing in action or information
                        about them. If they exhibit restraint toward their neighbors and
                        constructive approaches to international problems, we will look to the
                        future rather than to the past.</p>
                    <p>The sixth point of our new policy in the Pacific is that peace in Asia
                        requires a structure of economic cooperation reflecting the aspiration of
                        all the peoples in the region.</p>
                    <p>The Asian-Pacific economy has recently achieved more rapid growth than any
                        other region in the world. Our trade with East Asia now exceeds our
                        transactions with the European Community. America’s jobs, currency, and raw
                        materials depend upon economic ties with the Pacific Basin. Our trade with
                        the region is now increasing by more than 30 percent annually, reaching some
                        $46 billion last year. Our economies are increasingly interdependent as
                        cooperation grows between developed and developing nations.</p>
                    <p>Our relations with the five <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss>
                        countries are marked by growing maturity and by more modest and more
                        realistic expectations on both sides. We no longer approach them as donor to
                        dependent. These proud people look to us less for outright aid than for new
                        trading opportunities and more equitable arrangements for the transfer of
                        science and technology.</p>
                    <p>There is one common theme which was expressed to me by the leaders of every
                        Asian country that I visited. They all advocate the continuity of steady and
                        responsible American leadership. They seek self-reliance in their own future
                        and in their own relations with us.</p>
                    <p>Our military assistance to allies and friends is a modest responsibility, but
                        its political significance far surpasses the small cost involved. We serve
                        our highest national interests by strengthening their self-reliance, their
                        relations with us, their solidarity with each other, and their regional
                        security.</p>
                    <p>I emphasized to every leader I met that the United States is a Pacific
                        nation. I pledged, as President, I will continue America’s active concern
                        for Asia and our presence in the Asian-Pacific region.</p>
                    <p>Asia is entering a new era. We can contribute to a new structure of stability
                        founded on a balance among the major powers, strong ties to <pb n="355"
                            facs="0386" xml:id="pg_355"/>our allies in the region, an easing of
                        tension between adversaries, the self-reliance and regional solidarity of
                        smaller nations, and expanding economic ties and cultural exchanges. These
                        components of peace are already evident. Our foreign policy in recent years
                        and in recent days encourages their growth.</p>
                    <p>If we can remain steadfast, historians will look back and view the 1970’s as
                        the beginning of a period of peaceful cooperation and progress, a time of
                        growing community for all the nations touched by this great ocean.</p>
                    <p>Here in the Pacific crossroads of Hawaii, we envision hope for a wider
                        community of man. We see the promise of a unique republic which includes all
                        the world’s races. No other country has been so truly a free, multiracial
                        society. Hawaii is a splendid example, a splendid showcase of America and
                        exemplifies our destiny as a Pacific nation.</p>
                    <p>America’s Pacific heritage emerged from this remarkable State. I am proud to
                        visit Hawaii—the island star in the American firmament which radiates the
                        universal magic of <hi rend="italic">aloha.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Let there flow from Hawaii—and from all of the States in our Union—to all
                        peoples, East and West, a new spirit of interchange to build human
                        brotherhood.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much.</p>

                    <p>Tom Brokaw: Mr. President, do you think that it is possible for you to make
                        decisions in the name of national security if those decisions do not reflect
                        the popular will of the people?</p>
                    <p>The President: It does make it somewhat difficult, Tom, but I think it is the
                        responsibility of a President to fully inform the American people and
                        convince them that what we are seeking to do in foreign policy is in our
                        best interests. And if a President carries out that responsibility, then he
                        can and will have the support of the American people.</p>
                    <pb n="356" facs="0387" xml:id="pg_356"/>
                    <p>Mr. Brokaw: Is that the situation now in Angola? Do you have to convince the
                        American people of what you consider to be the national security of the
                        United States there?</p>
                    <p>The President: I believe there is a need and necessity for that. I don’t
                        believe that enough Americans understand the great responsibilities we have
                        as a nation on a worldwide basis, and that includes, of course, Africa as a
                        whole. What we really want and what we are seeking to do in Angola is to get
                        an African solution to an African problem, and through bilateral
                        negotiations, through working with the Organization of African Unity,
                        through relations with the Soviet Union and others, we are trying to achieve
                        that African solution to an African problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brokaw: Mr. President, the Soviet Union quite clearly has signaled in a
                            <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss> article that it wants all major
                        powers to withdraw militarily from Angola. Has Moscow privately communicated
                        that to you as well?</p>
                    <p>The President: We are working with all powers, including the Soviet Union, to
                        try and permit the Angolan people, the three different groups there at the
                        present time, to get a decision or solution that will reflect a majority
                        view of the Angolan people. And we are doing it, as I indicated, with a
                        number of major powers, including the Soviet Union, as well as the many,
                        many African countries that are a part of the Organization of African
                        Unity.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brokaw: But as a result of this <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss>
                        article, is it your understanding now that Russia is prepared to break off
                        its military support and to have Cuba quit sending troops as well to
                        Angola?</p>
                    <p>The President: I don’t believe we can say categorically that that is their
                        intention. We are simply working with them because a continuation of that
                        confrontation is destabilizing. It is, I think, inconsistent with the aims
                        and objectives of détente, and we are making some headway. But I can’t say
                        categorically that the end result is what we want it to be at the present
                        time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brokaw: Mr. President, in a recent speech, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said there is a gray area
                        between foreign policy and national security which, he said, we deny
                        ourselves at great risk to our national security.<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2"
                            >In his November 24 speech in Detroit, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said: “We must keep in mind that in a world
                            where totalitarian government can manipulate friendly political parties,
                            there is a gray area between foreign policy and overt intervention which
                            we deny ourselves only at grave risk to our national security.”
                            (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> December 15, 1975,
                            p. 849)</note> I suppose that training foreign mercenaries for use in
                        Angola might be called part of that gray area. Are we training foreign
                        mercenaries for use in Angola?</p>
                    <pb n="357" facs="0388" xml:id="pg_357"/>
                    <p>The President: The United States is not training foreign mercenaries in
                        Angola. We do expend some Federal funds, or United States funds, in trying
                        to be helpful, but we are not training foreign mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brokaw: Are we financing the training of foreign mercenaries?</p>
                    <p>The President: We are working with other countries that feel they have an
                        interest in giving the Angolans an opportunity to make the decision for
                        themselves, and I think this is a proper responsibility of the Federal
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brokaw: Mr. President, while you may disagree with the results of the
                        Senate vote on Angola,<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3">On December 19, 1975, the
                            Senate approved the <persName corresp="#p_TJ_1">Tunney</persName>
                            amendment; see <ref target="#d64">Document 64</ref>.</note> do you agree
                        that it probably represents the will of the American people?</p>
                    <p>The President: It may at this time. But I will repeat, as I said a few
                        moments ago, the American people, I think, if told and fully informed as to
                        the role and responsibility and the aims and objectives of the American
                        Government in trying to let the Angolans and the Africans come to a
                        solution, I think in time the American people will support what we have been
                        trying to do in Angola.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brokaw: Mr. President, in the past the congressional role in foreign
                        policy has been largely confined to a few chairmen and senior members. Now
                        the process has been broadened considerably. You are formerly a man of
                        Congress. Do you think that is a healthy sign?</p>
                    <p>The President: I think Congress, under the Constitution, does have a proper
                        role in foreign policy, but I don’t think our forefathers who drafted that
                        Constitution ever envisioned that 535 Members of the House and Senate could
                        execute foreign policy on a day-to-day basis. I think the drafters of the
                        Constitution felt that a President had to have the opportunity for
                        decisiveness, for flexibility, for continuity in the execution of foreign
                        policy, and somehow we have to mesh the role and responsibility of the
                        Congress, which is proper, with the opportunity for the President to carry
                        out that foreign policy in the best interests of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Now, there have been some instances in recent months where I think the
                        actions of the Congress have hampered, interfered with the execution of
                        foreign policy, and let me cite one or two examples.</p>
                    <p>The action of the Congress about a year ago has harmed the opportunity of
                        many to emigrate from the Soviet Union.<note n="4" xml:id="d66fn4">Reference
                            is to the <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_VC_2">Vanik</persName> amendment to the Foreign Trade
                            Act of 1974; see <ref target="#d31">Document 31</ref>.</note> I noticed
                        just the other day that the emigration from the Soviet Union is down this
                        year, <pb n="358" facs="0389" xml:id="pg_358"/>including many reductions in
                        the emigration of Soviet Jews from Russia. I think the action of the
                        Congress was harmful in that regard.</p>
                    <p>It is my judgment that in the case of congressional action on Turkish
                            aid,<note n="5" xml:id="d66fn5">See <ref target="#d52fn4">footnote 4,
                                Document 52</ref>.</note> they have slowed down the potential
                        solution to the Cyprus problem.</p>
                    <p>In some respects—and I emphasize some—the action of the Congress has hurt our
                        efforts in the intelligence field, although the Congress in some respects in
                        this area has illuminated what were, and I think we all recognize, some
                        abuses in the intelligence field.<note n="6" xml:id="d66fn6">The Church
                            Committee investigating possible <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            involvement in assassinations, among other issues, had issued an interim
                            report in December 1975.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>But overall there has to be a better understanding of the role of the
                        Congress and the role of the President, and they have to be meshed if we are
                        going to be successful.</p>
                    <p>John Chancellor: Mr. President, is it because of Vietnam and the fact that
                        President Johnson and, to some degree, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> had a lot of control over Vietnam
                        and the Congress had very little control of it that you are in this fix?</p>
                    <p>The President: I believe some of the instances that I have cited, John, are
                        an aftermath of the trauma of Vietnam. Congress really asserted itself in
                        the latter days of the Vietnam war. We all understand why. And Congress,
                        having whetted its appetite, so to speak, I think, in the last few months,
                        has continued to do some things that have been harmful in the execution on a
                        day-to-day basis of our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brokaw: Mr. President, as a result of the Soviet role in Angola, the fact
                        that the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks now have bogged down
                        somewhat, the fact that the spirit and the letter of the Helsinki
                            agreements<note n="7" xml:id="d66fn7">See <ref target="#d62fn2">footnote
                                2, Document 62</ref>.</note> have not been fully carried out by
                        Russia, are you now less enthusiastic about the prospects for détente?</p>
                    <p>The President: I am not at all, and I think it would be very unwise for a
                        President—me or anyone else—to abandon détente. I think détente is in the
                        best interest of this country. It is in the best interest of world
                        stability, world peace.</p>
                    <p>We have to recognize there are deep ideological differences between the
                        United States and the Soviet Union. We have to recognize they are a super
                        power militarily and industrially, just as we are. And when you have two
                        super powers that have such great influence, it is in the best interests of
                        those two countries to work together to ease tensions, to avoid
                        confrontation where possible, to improve relations on a worldwide basis.</p>
                    <pb n="359" facs="0390" xml:id="pg_359"/>
                    <p>And for us to abandon this working relationship and to go back to a cold war,
                        in my opinion, would be very unwise for we in the United States and the
                        world as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brokaw: But won’t you be under a lot of domestic political pressure in
                        this election year to change your attitude about détente?</p>
                    <p>The President: I think it would be just the reverse, because when we look at
                        détente—with the Berlin agreement of 1971, with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> I, which put, to some extent, a limitation on nuclear
                        development, et cetera—and when I look at the benefits that can come from
                        the Vladivostok agreement of 1974, it is my opinion that we must continue
                        rather than stop.</p>
                    <p>And if the American people take a good, calculated look at the benefits from
                        détente, I think they will support it rather than oppose it. And
                        politically, I think any candidate who says abandon détente will be the
                        loser in the long run.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brokaw: Mr. President, the historian, Will Durant, has said that a
                        statesman can’t afford to be a moralist as well. Briefly, do you agree with
                        that statement?</p>
                    <p>The President: I don’t believe there is any necessary conflict between the
                        two. We have to be pragmatic at the same time. We have to be practical as we
                        meet these specific problems. But if you lose your moral value, then I think
                        you have destroyed your capability to carry out things in a practical
                        way.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chancellor: Mr. President, I wonder if I could ask you a question about
                        the United Nations, which seems to have less utility in the world these days
                        than it did when it began, and also about some of the pressure groups that
                        we find both within the United Nations and as you see these pressure groups
                        in foreign affairs. I am thinking, for example, of the influence of American
                        Jews, of the growing influence of Arabs, of various groups. Aren’t those
                        groups kind of closing in on you, or do you feel that sometimes, sir?</p>
                    <p>The President: I believe that substantial progress, John, was made in the
                        United Nations in the Seventh Special Session late in 1975.<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d66fn8">See <ref target="#d60fn8">footnote 8, Document
                            60</ref>.</note> That was a very constructive session of the United
                        Nations, which sought to bring together the developing, as well as the
                        developed, nations. This was constructive.</p>
                    <p>Now, it is true that subsequent to that there were some very vitriolic
                        debates, there were some very serious differences that developed in the
                        United Nations from various pressure groups.</p>
                    <p>I would hope that in the future some of this conflict would subside and there
                        would be a more constructive effort made to solve the <pb n="360"
                            facs="0391" xml:id="pg_360"/>problems. And since I am always an
                        optimist—and I think it is important and necessary for a President to be
                        that—I think that as we move in the United Nations in the future that we can
                        calm some of the voices and get to some of the answers.</p>
                    <p>And so, this country’s foreign policy in the United Nations will be aimed in
                        that direction. And if we follow what we did in the Seventh Special Session
                        and what we are trying to do now, I think these pressure groups will
                        recognize that words are not the answer, but solutions will be to the
                        benefit of all parties concerned.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chancellor: In your history in public life as a Member of Congress, Mr.
                        President, and now as the President, do you find that organized groups play
                        a greater role now in terms of our foreign affairs or trying to influence
                        them than they did when you began?</p>
                    <p>The President: To some degree, yes. I think highly organized, very articulate
                        pressure groups can, on occasion, tend to distort the circumstances and can
                        hamper rather than help in the solution.</p>
                    <p>I don’t believe those pressure groups necessarily represent the American
                        people as a whole. So, a President, myself included, has to look at the
                        broad perspective and not necessarily in every instance respond to the
                        pressure groups that are well intentioned but who have a limited perspective
                        or scope.</p>
                    <p>And as we move ahead, we are going to try and predicate our foreign policy on
                        the best interests of all the people in this country, as well as our allies
                        and our adversaries, rather than to respond to a highly articulate, a very
                        tightly organized pressure group of any kind. We cannot let America’s
                        policies be predicated on a limited part of our population or our
                        society.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chancellor: Mr. President, thank you for spending that extra minute with
                        us. We thought that was an important point. I appreciate very much your
                        answering that question.</p>
                    <p>The President: Thank you, John.</p>

                        executive-legislative prerogative. What faces us is a congressional decision

                        executive branch had complied with all legal requirements for the kind of
                        operation involved in Angola and after eight congressional committees had
                        been briefed over 20 times without foreshadowing any opposition in
                        principle. The issue is not “victory” of one branch over another. The issue
                        is what constitutes a victory for the national interest.</p>
                    <p>I welcome this opportunity to explain the global significance of what is now
                        happening in Angola, the events that have brought us to this point, the U.S.
                        objectives, and the major consequences which can result if we fail to pursue
                        those objectives.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union’s massive and unprecedented intervention in the internal
                        affairs of Africa—with nearly 200 million dollars’ worth of arms and its
                        military technicians and advisers, with 11,000 Cuban combat troops, and with
                        substantial sea and airlift and naval cover in adjacent waters—is a matter
                        of urgent concern. Not only are the interests of the countries directly
                        affected at stake but also the interests of all nations in preserving global
                        stability—which is the precondition for all else mankind aspires to
                        accomplish.</p>
                    <p>In recent years the United States has sought to help build a new
                        international order less tied to the traditional patterns of power balances.
                        It was the United States which took the initiative in seeking to resolve the
                        most dangerous problems of our time by negotiation and cooperation rather
                        than by force of arms. It was we who saw that the historical necessity of
                        this period required a more stable relationship between the two nations that
                        possess the capacity to destroy civilization.</p>
                    <p>We have sought—and with some successes—to build more constructive relations
                        with the U.S.S.R. across a broad range: to contain <pb n="362" facs="0393"
                            xml:id="pg_362"/>strategic arms; to institutionalize cooperation in
                        economic, scientific, and cultural fields; to reduce tensions in areas where
                        our vital interests impinge on one another; and to avoid destabilizing
                        confrontations in peripheral areas of the globe—such as Angola. The
                        classical pattern of accumulating marginal advantages must be overcome and
                        mankind must build more constructive patterns if catastrophe is to be
                        avoided. No one has been more dedicated than the President and I to working
                        for these principles.</p>
                    <p>But our efforts have been founded upon one fundamental reality: peace
                        requires a sense of security, and security depends upon some form of
                        equilibrium between the great powers. And that equilibrium is impossible
                        unless the United States remains both strong and determined to use its
                        strength when required. This is our historic responsibility, for no other
                        nation has the capacity to act in this way. While constantly seeking
                        opportunities for conciliation, we need to demonstrate to potential
                        adversaries that cooperation is the only rational alternative. Any other
                        course will encourage the trends it seeks to accommodate; a challenge not
                        met today will tempt far more dangerous crises tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>If a continent such as Africa, only recently freed from external oppression,
                        can be made the arena for great-power ambitions, if immense quantities of
                        arms can affect far-off events, if large expeditionary forces can be
                        transported at will to dominate virtually helpless peoples—then all we have
                        hoped for in building a more stable and rational international order is in
                        jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>The effort of the Soviet Union and Cuba to take unilateral advantage of a
                        turbulent local situation where they have never had any historic interests
                        is a willful, direct assault upon the recent constructive trends in
                        U.S.-Soviet relations and our efforts to improve relations with Cuba. It is
                        an attempt to take advantage of our continuing domestic division and
                        self-torment. Those who have acted so recklessly must be made to see that
                        their conduct is unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>The history of the postwar period should give us pause. Military aggression,
                        direct or indirect, has frequently been successfully dealt with, but never
                        in the absence of a local balance of forces. U.S. policy in Angola has
                        sought to help friends achieve this balance. Angola represents the first
                        time since the aftermath of World War II that the Soviets have moved
                        militarily at long distances to impose a regime of their choice. It is the
                        first time that the United States has failed to respond to Soviet military
                        moves outside their immediate orbit. And it is the first time that Congress
                        has halted the executive’s action while it was in the process of meeting
                        this kind of threat.</p>
                    <p>Thus to claim that Angola is not an important country or that the United
                        States has no important interests there begs the principal ques<pb n="363"
                            facs="0394" xml:id="pg_363"/>tion. The objectives which the United
                        States has sought in Angola have not been aimed at defending, or acquiring,
                        intrinsic interests in that country. We are not opposing any particular
                        faction. We could develop constructive relations with any Angolan government
                        that derives from the will of the people. We have never been involved
                        militarily in Angola. We are not so involved now. We do not seek to be so
                        involved in the future.</p>
                    <p>Our objective is clear and simple: to help those African countries and those
                        groups within Angola that would resist external aggression by providing them
                        with needed <hi rend="italic">financial</hi> support. Those whom we seek to
                        assist are our friends; they share our hopes for negotiated solutions and
                        for African self-determination. They played a larger role than the <gloss

                        in striving toward Angolan independence.</p>
                    <p>But our deeper concern is for global stability. If the United States is seen
                        to emasculate itself in the face of massive, unprecedented Soviet and Cuban
                        intervention, what will be the perception of leaders around the world as
                        they make decisions concerning their future security?</p>
                    <p>Will they feel they can proceed to develop their nations in an international
                        climate which fosters cooperation and self-determination? How will they
                        adjust their conduct in the context of such events? And what conclusion will
                        an unopposed superpower draw when the next opportunity for intervention
                        beckons?</p>
                    <p>America’s modest direct strategic and economic interests in Angola are not
                        the central issue. The question is whether America still maintains the
                        resolve to act responsibly as a great power—prepared to face a challenge
                        when it arises, knowing that preventive action now may make unnecessary a
                        more costly response later.</p>
                    <p>Let there be no mistake about it—the culprits in the tragedy that is now
                        unfolding in Angola are the Soviet Union and its client state Cuba. But I
                        must note with some sadness that by its actions the Congress has deprived
                        the President of indispensable flexibility in formulating a foreign policy
                        which we believe to be in our national interest. And Congress has ignored
                        the crucial truth that a stable relationship with the Soviet Union based on
                        mutual restraint will be achieved only if Soviet lack of restraint carries
                        the risk of counteraction.</p>
                    <p>The consequences may well be far-reaching and substantially more painful than
                        the course we have recommended. When one great power attempts to obtain
                        special positions of influence based on military interventions, the other
                        power is sooner or later bound to act to offset this advantage in some other
                        place or manner. This will inevi<pb n="364" facs="0395" xml:id="pg_364"
                        />tably lead to a chain of action and reaction typical of other historic
                        eras in which great powers maneuvered for advantage, only to find themselves
                        sooner or later embroiled in a major crisis and often in open conflict.</p>
                    <p>It is precisely this pattern that must be broken—and that we wanted to break
                        until stopped—if a lasting easing of tensions is to be achieved. And if it
                        is not broken now, we will face harder choices and higher costs in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>It is in this context that we have framed our goals in Angola. Simply put, we
                        wish to see:</p>
                    <p>—A cease-fire, ending the tragic bloodshed in that country;</p>
                    <p>—Withdrawal of outside forces—Soviet, Cuban, and South African;</p>
                    <p>—Cessation of foreign military involvement; and</p>
                    <p>—Negotiations among the Angolan factions.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to accept any solution that emerges from African efforts. And
                        we are ready to offer economic assistance to the people of Angola when a
                        legitimate government is established there.</p>
                    <p>We have consistently advocated such a government representing all three
                        factions in Angola. We have never opposed participation by the Soviet-backed
                        Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                            >MPLA</gloss>. What we do oppose is the massive Soviet and Cuban
                        intervention and their expressed aim of denying the other two groups any
                        part in governing the country. Our overriding goal has been to assure that
                        Africans shape their own destiny and that traditional colonialism not be
                        replaced by a more modern version.</p>
                    <p>For the United States to be found wanting as a credible friend, precisely at
                        a time when moderate African states have clearly and repeatedly expressed
                        their hope that America provide the necessary balance to the Soviet Union
                        and Cuba, will have a major impact on those countries on the continent of
                        Africa which resisted all pressures and stuck by their position even after
                        the Senate cut off aid; on our allies in other parts of the world who look
                        to us for security; on other countries that seek ties with us primarily
                        because they see us as the guardian of international equilibrium.</p>

                    <p>During 1975 the Soviet Union is estimated to have contributed nearly 200
                        million dollars’ worth of military assistance to Angola. This equals the
                        entire amount of all military aid from all sources to sub-Saharan Africa in
                        1974.</p>
                    <p>Soviet arms have included infantry weapons—machineguns, bazookas, mortars,
                        and recoilless rifles—armored personnel carriers, heavy artillery, light and
                        medium tanks, truck-mounted multitube rocket launchers, helicopters, and
                        light aircraft. There are unconfirmed reports that the Soviet Union will
                        provide the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> with MIG–21 aircraft to
                        be piloted by Cubans.</p>
                    <p>A total of at least 46 flights of Soviet heavy and medium military transports
                        have ferried Soviet military equipment from the U.S.S.R. to Luanda and Congo
                        (Brazzaville), while a steady stream of Soviet and Cuban aircraft has
                        continued to bring Cuban troops across the Atlantic. Soviet naval
                        involvements clearly related to the Angolan event have continued in west
                        African waters for several weeks.</p>
                    <p>The implications of Cuba’s unprecedented and massive intervention cannot be
                        ignored. It is a geopolitical event of considerable significance. For the
                        first time, Cuba has sent an expeditionary force to another nation on
                        another continent. About 11,000 Cuban military personnel have been sent to
                        Angola.</p>
                    <p>If allowed to proceed unchecked, this blatant power play cannot but carry
                        with it far-reaching implications—including the impact it will have on the
                        attitudes and future conduct of the nations of this hemisphere. Indeed,
                        friend and foe alike cannot fail to contrast the sending of a large Cuban
                        expeditionary force with our apparent inability to provide even indirect
                        financial assistance. The failure of the United States to respond
                        effectively will be regarded in many parts of the world as an indication of
                        our future determination to counter similar Communist interventions.</p>
                    <p>We have been asked why we do not respond with other pressures on the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>The first answer is that many of the links the Administration has tried to
                        forge—such as trade and credit, which would have provided incentives for
                        restraint and levers for penalties—have been precluded by earlier
                        congressional actions. But two other instruments have been suggested: wheat
                        sales and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.</p>
                    <p>A moratorium was placed on wheat sales for four months in 1975. To use this
                        device every three months is to blunt it permanently. Above all, economic
                        measures take too much time to affect a fast-moving situ<pb n="366"
                            facs="0397" xml:id="pg_366"/>ation like Angola; any longer term impact
                        would be of little use to those immediately threatened. We should also
                        ponder whether we want to return to the situation, now prevented by the
                        grain agreement,<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">A U.S.-Soviet agreement on the
                            sale of U.S. grain to the Soviet Union was signed on October 20, 1975,
                            in Moscow.</note> in which the U.S.S.R. can capriciously enter and leave
                        the U.S. grain trade.</p>
                    <p>As for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, we have never considered these to
                        be a favor which we grant to the Soviet Union to be turned on and off
                        according to the ebb and flow of our relations. The fact is that limiting
                        the growth of nuclear arsenals is an overriding global problem that must be
                        dealt with urgently for our own sake and for the sake of world peace.</p>
                    <p>Still, we have made clear that a continuation of actions like those in Angola
                        must threaten the entire web of Soviet-U.S. relations. In this sense, both
                        negotiations and the overall relationship are in long-term jeopardy unless
                        restraint is exercised. But there is no substitute for a local balance;
                        indirect pressures can succeed only if rapid local victories are
                        foreclosed.</p>
                    <p>Have we really thought through the implications of our decisions? Do we
                        really want the world to conclude that if the Soviet Union chooses to
                        intervene in a massive way, and if Cuban or other troops are used as an
                        expeditionary force, the United States will not be able to muster the unity
                        or resolve to provide even financial assistance to those who are threatened?
                        Can those faced with such a threat without hope of assistance from us be
                        expected to resist? Do we want our potential adversaries to conclude that,
                        in the event of future challenges, America’s internal divisions are likely
                        to deprive us of even minimal leverage over developments of global
                        significance?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Our second objective is to help our friends in black
                            Africa who oppose Soviet and Cuban intervention.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Only in recent years has Africa become free of great-power rivalry; it must
                        not once again become an arena in which the ambitions of outside forces are
                        pursued. We have sought with our African friends to maintain a local balance
                        of power so there can be no imposed solution that would deprive the Angolan
                        people of the right to determine their own destiny.</p>
                    <p>We are told that we need not concern ourselves, because in the final analysis
                        and at some indefinite date in the future, African nationalism will reassert
                        itself and drive out foreign influence. Even were this to prove true, it
                        still ignores the fact that governments under pressure will be forced to
                        yield whenever a threat develops. Those who are threatened cannot afford to
                        wait; they must decide whether to resist or <pb n="367" facs="0398"
                            xml:id="pg_367"/>to adjust. Advice which counsels patience and
                        confidence in the verdict of history is a mockery to those who are concerned
                        for the fate of their country today. History rarely helps those who do not
                        help themselves.</p>
                    <p>Some charge that we have acted in collusion with South Africa. This is
                        untrue. We had no foreknowledge of South Africa’s intentions and in no way
                        cooperated with it militarily. Nor do we view South African intervention
                        more benevolently than we do the intervention of other outside powers.
                        Indeed, we have formally proposed that the removal of outside forces begin
                        with those of South Africa and have asked—in vain—for an indication of how
                        soon thereafter Soviet and Cuban forces would be withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>It is also claimed that because of our support for the side which later felt
                        itself compelled to seek the aid of South Africa, we have lost influence in
                        black Africa. One cannot generalize so easily about the perceptions of the
                        African people, as the firm stand at Addis Ababa of 22 <gloss
                            target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> members against <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"

                        should demonstrate. Behind this stand, which coincided with the U.S.
                        position, was awareness that the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                        represented only a minority of Angolans, and also a genuine apprehension
                        over Soviet and Cuban, as well as South African, intervention. Indeed, it is
                        our inability to support our African friends that will cost us influence in
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>We are firmly convinced that, had there been no outside interference
                        initiated by the Soviet Union, the Africans would have found their own
                        solution. No single movement would have been strong enough to take over. The
                        resulting solution would have been more representative of the people of
                        Angola than a government imposed by an outside power and representing only a
                        minority faction.</p>
                    <p>The outcome in Angola will have repercussions throughout Africa. The
                        confidence of countries neighboring Angola—Zambia and Zaïre—as well as other
                        African countries, in the will and power of the United States will be
                        severely shaken if they see that the Soviet Union and Cuba are unopposed in
                        their attempt to impose a regime of their choice on Angola. They and others
                        elsewhere may well adjust their policies to what they consider to be the
                        forces of the future.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The means we have chosen have been limited, and explained
                            to Congress.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our immediate objective was to provide leverage for diplomatic efforts to
                        bring about a just and peaceful solution. They were not conceived
                        unilaterally by the United States; they represented support to friends who
                        requested our financial assistance.</p>
                    <p>We chose covert means because we wanted to keep our visibility to a minimum;
                        we wanted the greatest possible opportunity for an African solution. We felt
                        that overt assistance would elaborate a formal doctrine justifying
                        great-power intervention—aside from the technical <pb n="368" facs="0399"
                            xml:id="pg_368"/>issues such as in what budgetary category this aid
                        should be given and how it could be reconciled with legislative restrictions
                        against the transfer of U.S. arms by recipients.</p>
                    <p>The Angola situation is of a type in which diplomacy without leverage is
                        impotent, yet direct military confrontation would involve unnecessary risks.
                        Thus it is precisely one of those gray areas where covert methods are
                        crucial if we are to have any prospect of influencing certain events of
                        potentially global importance.</p>
                    <p>We chose a covert form of response with the greatest reluctance. But in doing
                        so, we were determined to adhere to the highest standard of
                        executive-legislative consultation. Eight congressional committees were
                        briefed on 24 separate occasions. We sought in these briefings to determine
                        the wishes of Congress. While we do not claim that every member approved our
                        actions, we had no indication of basic opposition.</p>
                    <p>Between July and December 1975 we discussed the Angolan situation on numerous
                        occasions with members of the foreign relations comittees and the
                        appropriations committees of both Houses and the committees of both Houses
                        that have <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> oversight responsibilities.
                        The two committees investigating <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        activities—the Church Committee and the Pike Committee—were also briefed.
                        Altogether more than two dozen Senators, about 150 Congressmen, and over 100
                        staff members of both Houses were informed. I am attaching to my statement a
                        list of all the briefings carried out.<note n="5" xml:id="d67fn5">Not

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Chairman, where are we now?</p>
                    <p>We are told that by providing money and arms in Angola we are duplicating the
                        mistakes we made in Viet-Nam. Such an argument confuses the expenditure of
                        tens of millions of dollars with the commitment of U.S. troops. If we accept
                        such a gross distortion of history—if we accept the claim that we can no
                        longer do anything to aid our friends abroad because we will inevitably do
                        too much—then the tragedy of Viet-Nam will indeed be monumental.</p>
                    <p>We will have lost all ability to respond to anything less than direct and
                        substantial challenge. And having lost that ability, we will eventually
                        discover that by failing to respond at an early stage, our ultimate response
                        will have to be greater and the stakes will be higher. If we do not exercise
                        our responsibilities to maintain the international balance, if Congress and
                        the executive are unable to act in concert when vital national interests are
                        affected, then world security may well be seriously undermined.</p>
                    <pb n="369" facs="0400" xml:id="pg_369"/>
                    <p>Many of the members of this committee have expressed their general support
                        for our policy of easing tensions with the Soviet Union. We in the executive
                        branch are grateful for that support. But this process cannot be divided
                        into those segments which the Soviets will honor and those which we will
                        allow them to ignore. What the United States does when confronted with a
                        challenge like Angola can be of great significance in shaping our future
                        relationship with the Soviet Union. A demonstration of a lack of resolve
                        could lead the Soviets to a great miscalculation thereby plunging us into a
                        major confrontation which neither of us wants. Credibility determines, to a
                        great degree, what a nation can accomplish without a resort to force. And as
                        credibility is reduced, the eventual need to resort to force increases. And
                        in the end, we are all the losers.</p>
                    <p>The United States must make it clear that Angola sets no precedent; this type
                        of action will not be tolerated elsewhere. This must be demonstrated by both
                        the executive and the Congress—in our national interest and in the interest
                        of world peace.</p>
                    <p>To the Soviet Union and to Cuba, the Administration says: We will continue to
                        make our case to the American public. We will not tolerate wanton disregard
                        for the interests of others and for the cause of world peace.</p>
                    <p>To the American people, the Administration says: The time has come to put
                        aside self-accusation, division, and guilt. Our own country’s safety and the
                        progress of mankind depend crucially upon a united and determined America.
                        Today, as throughout our 200 years, the world looks to us to stand up for
                        what is right. By virtue of our strength and values we are leaders in the
                        defense of freedom; without us there can be neither security nor
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>To the Congress, the Administration says: Whatever our past disagreements,
                        let the Congress and the executive now resolve to shape a cooperative
                        relationship that will enable the United States to play a responsible
                        international role. Both branches will have to do their share in restoring
                        the kind of nonpartisan support that has served our foreign policy so well
                        in the past.</p>
                    <p>On the issue of Angola, the Administration is now seriously considering overt
                        financial aid, and we will soon be consulting with the Congress on this
                        possibility. But whatever that decision, let us work together with an
                        appreciation of the larger interests involved and with a sense of national
                        responsibility. A united America cannot be ignored by our adversaries.
                        Together we will preserve the independence of those who face the prospect of
                        oppression. Together we will hearten the friends of liberty and peace
                        everywhere.</p>

                    <p>24976. For Ambassador. Subject: U.S. Policy Toward <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>1. Following is a non-verbatim summary of the Counselor’s discussion of this
                        subject to the <gloss target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss> Chiefs of Mission
                        meeting in London in mid December. It is intended for your background
                        guidance and that of your senior staff and is not to be used directly in
                        your talks with host government.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Begin Summary.</hi> We are witnessing the emergence of
                        the Soviet Union as a super power on a global scale. This will be a
                        long-term process. It is a process that is just beginning in global terms as
                        the Soviets are just now breaking out of their continental mold. They are
                        just now developing modalities for carrying out such a global policy.</p>
                    <p>3. The reason why it is possible for the United States and its Western
                        European allies to develop the policies that will allow us to cope with this
                        situation is that Soviet power is developing irregularly. It is subject to
                        flaws and to requirements which in some cases only the outside world can
                        meet.</p>
                    <p>4. Their thrust as an imperial power comes at a time well after that period
                        when the last imperial power, Germany, made the plunge, and it hence comes
                        at a time when different rules and perceptions apply. The Soviets have been
                        inept. They have not been able to bring the attractions that past imperial
                        powers brought to their conquests. They have not brought the ideological,
                        legal, cultural, architectural, organizational and other values and skills
                        that characterized the British, French and German adventures.</p>
                    <p>5. In addition, there are serious underlying pressures and tensions in the
                        Soviet system itself. The base from which imperialism asserts itself has
                        serious problems in the economic and social sectors. There are also internal
                        nationalist groups which are growing. Non-Russian nationalist groups in
                        Russia are growing at a disproportionally faster rate, which will add to
                        these tensions in the base whence springs Soviet imperialism.</p>
                    <p>6. The Soviets have been particularly unskilled in building viable
                        international structures. They have nothing approaching the European <pb
                            n="371" facs="0402" xml:id="pg_371"/>Community or the many other
                        successful Western institutions. In Eastern Europe particularly, the single
                        most important unifying force is the presence of sheer Soviet military
                        power. There has been no development of a more viable, organic structure. If
                        anything, the last thirty years have intensified the urges in Eastern
                        European countries for autonomy, for identity. There has been an
                        intensification of the desire to break out of the Soviet straitjacket. This
                        has happened in every Eastern European country to one degree or another.
                        There are almost no genuine friends of the Soviets left in Eastern Europe,
                        except possibly Bulgaria.</p>
                    <p>7. The Soviets’ inability to acquire loyalty in Eastern Europe is an
                        unfortunate historical failure because Eastern Europe is within their scope
                        and area of natural interest. It is doubly tragic that in this area of vital
                        interest and crucial importance it has not been possible for the Soviet
                        Union to establish roots of interest that go beyond sheer power.</p>
                    <p>8. It is, therefore, important to remember that the main, if not the only,
                        instrument of Soviet imperialism has been power.</p>
                    <p>9. The reason we can today talk and think in terms of dealing with Soviet
                        imperialism, outside of and in addition to simple confrontation, is
                        precisely because Soviet power is emerging in such a flawed way. This gives
                        us the time to develop and to react. There is no way to prevent the
                        emergence of the Soviet Union as a superpower. What we can do is affect the
                        way in which that power is developed and used. Not only can we balance it in
                        the traditional sense but we can affect its usage—and that is what détente
                        is all about.</p>
                    <p>10. It is often asked how détente is doing. The question itself evades the
                        central issue we are trying to pose. That is, what do you do in the face of
                        increasing Soviet power? We will be facing this increased power if our
                        relationship with the Russians is sweet or our relationship with the
                        Russians is sour. The day when the U.S. could choose its preferences from
                        two alternatives is over: that is, turning our back on the world—usually
                        behind the protection of another power like the British Navy—or changing the
                        world. That choice no longer exists for us. There is too much power in the
                        world for us to ignore, not just the Soviets, but other industrial powers,
                        raw material producers, and even the combined political power of the dwarf
                        states. Nor do we today have enough power to simply overwhelm these
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>11. So the Soviets will be seen and heard on the world stage no matter what
                        we do. Therefore, the question of whether or not détente is up or down at a
                        particular moment is largely irrelevant. We Americans like to keep score
                        cards, but the historic challenge of the Soviet Union will not go away and
                        the problem of coping with the effects of that growing Soviet power also
                        won’t go away. We don’t have any alternative except to come to grips with
                        the various forms of power which sur<pb n="372" facs="0403" xml:id="pg_372"
                        />round us in the world. We have to get away from seeing détente as a
                        process which appeases or propitiates Soviet power. We have to see our task
                        as managing or domesticating this power. That is our central problem in the
                        years ahead, not finding agreements to sign or atmospheres to improve,
                        although those have some effect. Our challenge is how to live in a world
                        with another super power, and anticipate the arrival of a third super power,
                        China, in twenty years or so.</p>
                    <p>12. The debate in the United States on détente is illustrated by comments
                        that Soviet trade is a one-way street. It seems that today you can’t just
                        get payment for the goods you sell—you must get Jewish emigration, or arms
                        restraint, or any number of other things.</p>
                    <p>13. Our European friends have extended considerable credit to the Soviets and
                        Eastern European countries, while the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                        does not extend lines of credit but rather approves financing on the basis
                        of each project. That feature gives us some control over the direction of
                        Soviet economic development. The Europeans have surrendered on this point.
                        While not falling into the trade trap, we have seen trade as a set of
                        instrumentalities to address the set of problems we face with the Soviets.
                        We have to find a way to develop a coherent trade strategy that goes beyond
                        the commercial views of individual firms.</p>
                    <p>14. The grain agreement is a good but narrow example of what I am talking
                        about. The Soviets were forced to accept that they need substantial imports
                        from the United States. That gives us leverage, but only if it is done
                        within a coherent framework of policies to achieve certain objectives.
                            <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss> has been considered a concession to
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and in a sense it is. The
                        Soviets don’t like paying interest—they prefer to earn their way as they go.
                        If this is an accurate assessment, then with <gloss target="#t_MFN_1"
                            >MFN</gloss> and credit policies we can get the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to be competitively engaged in our
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> markets. If done skillfully, this
                        forces them to meet the requirements of the sophisticated <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> market. <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss>
                        entry into <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> markets can have an impact on
                        Soviet behavior. This is not a trivial matter.</p>
                    <p>15. It is in our long-term interests to use these strengths to break down the
                        autarkic nature of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. There are
                        consumer choices being made in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        that, although more below the surface than those in the United States, can
                        be exploited. This is just one illustration. There are many assets in the
                        West in this area and instead of looking at them as just commercial sales,
                        we need to be using them to draw the Soviet Union into a series of
                        dependencies and ties with the West. It is a long-term project.</p>
                    <p>16. When we lost the <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss> battle with
                        Congress, we lost our ability to impose a degree of discipline on the Soviet
                        Union as we were able to do in the case of the grain deal. This is the real
                        tragedy of losing that trade issue. In the long-term, we have suffered a
                        setback.</p>
                    <pb n="373" facs="0404" xml:id="pg_373"/>
                    <p>17. With regard to Eastern Europe, it must be in our long-term interest to
                        influence events in this area—because of the present unnatural relationship
                        with the Soviet Union—so that they will not sooner or later explode, causing
                        WW III. This inorganic, unnatural relationship is a far greater danger to
                        world peace than the conflict between East and West. There is one
                        qualification to this statement. If Western Europe becomes so concerned with
                        its economic and social problems that an imbalance develops, then perhaps
                        the dangers to the United States’ interests will be endangered by the simple
                        change in the balance of power.</p>
                    <p>18. So, it must be our policy to strive for an evolution that makes the
                        relationship between the Eastern Europeans and the Soviet Union an organic
                        one. Any excess of zeal on our part is bound to produce results that could
                        reverse the desired process for a period of time, even though the process
                        would remain inevitable within the next 100 years. But, of course, for us
                        that is too long a time to wait.</p>
                    <p>19. So, our policy must be a policy of responding to the clearly visible
                        aspirations in Eastern Europe for a more autonomous existence within the
                        context of a strong Soviet geopolitical influence. This has worked in
                        Poland. The Poles have been able to overcome their romantic political
                        inclinations which led to their disasters in the past. They have been
                        skillful in developing a policy that is satisfying their needs for a
                        national identity without arousing Soviet reactions. It is a long
                        process.</p>
                    <p>20. A similar process is now going on in Hungary. Janos Kadar’s performance
                        has been remarkable in finding ways which are acceptable to the Soviet Union
                        which develop Hungarian roots and the natural aspirations of the people. He
                        has conducted a number of experiments in the social and economic areas. To a
                        large degree he has been able to do this because the Soviets have four
                        divisions in Hungary and, therefore, have not been overly concerned. He has
                        skillfully used their presence as a security blanket for the Soviets, in a
                        way that has been advantageous to the development of his own country.</p>
                    <p>21. The Romanian picture is different as one would expect from their
                        different history. The Romanians have striven for autonomy but they have
                        been less daring and innovative in their domestic systems. They remain among
                        the most rigid countries in the internal organization of their system.</p>
                    <p>22. We seek to influence the emergence of the Soviet imperial power by making
                        the base more natural and organic so that it will not remain founded in
                        sheer power alone. But there is no alternative open to us other than that of
                        influencing the way Soviet power is used.</p>
                    <p>23. Finally, on Yugoslavia. We and the Western Europeans, indeed the Eastern
                        Europeans as well, have an interest which borders on the vital for us in
                        continuing the independence of Yugoslavia from Soviet domination. Of course
                        we accept that Yugoslav behavior will continue <pb n="374" facs="0405"
                            xml:id="pg_374"/>to be, as it has been in the past, influenced and
                        constrained by Soviet power, but any shift back by Yugoslavia into the
                        Soviet orbit would represent a major strategic set-back for the West. So we
                        are concerned about what will happen when <persName corresp="#p_TJB_1"
                            >Tito</persName> disappears, and it is worrying us a good deal.</p>
                    <p>24. So our basic policy continues to be that which we have pursued since
                        1948–49, keeping Yugoslavia in a position of substantial independence from
                        the Soviet Union. Now at the same time we would like them to be less

                        especially disabuse them of any notion that our interest in their relative

                    <p>In a campaign speech delivered in Exeter, New Hampshire, on February 10,
                        1976, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald Reagan</persName>, a candidate for
                        the Republican Presidential nomination, criticized the foreign policy of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administration, its
                        conception of détente, and what he perceived as concessions made to the
                        Soviet Union in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (<gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>) and the 1975 Helsinki agreements. For
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>, détente under the
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administration had been a
                        “one-way street” that favored the Soviets, a policy that “will fail. As a
                        two-way street it may succeed.” <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                            >Reagan</persName> asserted, “we can bargain successfully only if we are
                        strong militarily and only if we are willing to defend ourselves if
                        necessary.” “For many years,” he continued, “we remained the strongest
                        nation on earth. Through the 1950s and on into the early ’60s our national
                        security was coupled with a sense of national unity and purpose. But that
                        changed. The Soviet Union has now forged ahead in producing nuclear and
                        conventional weapons. Opening the Chinese door [in 1972] offered an
                        excellent opportunity for us to blunt the expansionism of the Soviet Union.
                        But we have since lost the momentum we gained by acting as if we expected
                        the Soviets to inherit the earth.” With the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> I agreement, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                            >Reagan</persName> argued, “we compromised our clear technological lead
                        in the anti-ballistic missile system, the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1"
                            >ABM</gloss>, for the sake of a deal”; at Helsinki, the administration
                        “agreed to legitimize the boundaries of Eastern Europe, legally acquiescing
                        in the loss of freedom of millions of Eastern Europeans.” “Let us not be
                        satisfied with a foreign policy <pb n="375" facs="0406" xml:id="pg_375"
                        />whose principal accomplishment seems to be our acquisition of the right to
                        sell Pepsi-Cola in Siberia. It is time we, the people of the United States,
                        demanded a policy that puts our nation’s interests as the first priority.”

                    <p>Responding to <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s criticisms,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald Ford</persName>, in a February
                        13 Orlando, Florida, press conference, stated he was “very proud of the
                        accomplishments of our American foreign policy” and defended his
                        administration’s record. “We are at peace,” he asserted. “We are at peace
                        because we are strong.” Pointing out that he had submitted “strong,
                        affirmative Defense Department budgets” to Congress, <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> went on to list his administration’s
                        foreign policy achievements: the alliance with Western Europe “has never
                        been better,” relations with Japan “are excellent,” and there had been
                        “tremendous success in diffusing the volatile situation in the Middle East.”
                        As far as relations with Communist countries were concerned, <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> noted that the United States had
                        “maintained a growing relationship with the People’s Republic of China. At
                        the same time, we have been able to negotiate with strength with the Soviet
                        Union.” He also defended his administration’s negotiation of an arms
                        limitation agreement with Moscow, arguing it would “relax tensions between
                        the two super powers.” <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>
                        concluded by saying his foreign policy was “in the best interest of the
                        United States” and “I am proud of it. I think most Americans are proud of
                        it, and they should know that it will continue—a policy of peace with
                        strength under the next 4 years of the <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"

                    <p>In the weeks following the New Hampshire primary, <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> eschewed the word “détente” in his
                        public appearances. When asked about this during an interview with a Miami
                        television station, <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> commented,
                        “Détente is only a word that was coined,” adding, “I don’t think it is
                        applicable anymore.” He told his interviewer, “I think what <pb n="376"
                            facs="0407" xml:id="pg_376"/>we ought to say is that the United States
                        will meet with superpowers, the Soviet Union and with China and others, and
                        seek to relax tensions so that we can continue a policy of peace through
                        strength.” He continued: “If we are strong militarily, which we are, and if
                        we continue that strength, we can negotiate with the Soviet Union, with
                        China, and with others to maintain that peace.” In a <hi rend="italic"
                            >Chicago Tribune</hi> article reporting <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                            >Ford</persName>’s comments, “top White House officials” were said to
                        “insist” that the President’s remarks “do not reflect any change in American
                        foreign policy.” However, one unidentified official stated: “It did not go
                        unnoticed that one survey showed that detente cost the President votes in
                        New Hampshire.” White House Press Secretary Ron <persName corresp="#p_NR_1"
                            >Nessen</persName> explained that the word détente “has become perverted
                        and polluted by use and misuse” and that <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                            >Ford</persName>’s decision not to use it was “‘an effort to educate and
                        illuminate’ Americans about the administration’s foreign policy.” (Aldo

                    <p>On March 5, during a question-and-answer session following an address to the
                        Everett McKinley Dirksen Forum in Peoria, Illinois, <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> began his answer to a question
                        regarding the administration’s foreign policy toward the Soviet Union and
                        China by stating, “let me say very specifically that we are going to forget
                        the use of the use of the word détente.” “The word is inconsequential,” he
                        continued. “What happens in the negotiations between the United States and
                        the Soviet Union, what happens in the negotiations between the People’s
                        Republic of China and the United States—those are the things that are of
                        consequence. Now, this administration believes that we have an obligation
                        not to go back to the cold war where confrontation, in effect, took place
                        literally every day of the year. We have an obligation to try and meet every
                        problem individually; specifically, every issue as it comes up, in an effort
                        to negotiate rather than to confront, whether it’s with the Soviet Union or
                        the People’s Republic of China. And we can do this effectively if we have
                        the strength, militarily and otherwise, to have a two-way street. Now, the
                        United States, despite what some critics have said, has not under any
                        circumstances gotten the short end of the deal. We’re good Yankee traders,
                        and we’ve done darn well by the United States.” (<hi rend="italic">Public

                        out as briefly as I can what I hope is an objective statement of your
                        situation, plus some thoughts on themes and how we may be able to cope with
                        current problems. I am substantially more confident of my description of the
                        current situation than I am of the suggestions on what to do about it. Once
                        again I should caution, however, that I will almost certainly exaggerate the
                        more negative elements of your contemporary position than is probably
                        warranted, and downplay the very real strengths you still possess. So let me
                        emphasize now that I do not consider the situation irreparably lost; I do
                        consider that you have a great reservoir of respect (even awe), confidence
                        and popularity around the country, and that you are more respected (and
                        feared) on the Hill than we ofttimes think. Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRC_1">Clark</persName> told me today, for example, that he
                        hopes to begin a colloquy on the Senate floor next week on détente in
                        support of you and your position. Parenthetically, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CRC_1">Clark</persName> was on television a few days ago
                        defending you firmly and well on détente.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Problem.</p>
                    <p>Let me first lay out my conclusions on your present situation. Some of them
                        you will have seen before in the telegram; others are new.</p>
                    <p>—Détente is in trouble and consequently you, because you are so closely
                        identified with it, are also in trouble. I know how strongly you feel that
                        as this process continues your flexibility with the Soviets (and I suppose
                        the same is true with the Chinese) is being limited. Equally, I recognize
                        that for good and sufficient reasons you therefore do your utmost to be
                        cautious in your public approach. But the net effect, in all honesty, is

                        longer think you can afford this posture, no matter how right it may be in
                        substantive terms. You have to demonstrate to the public that you, too, are
                        tough. You did this on Angola and it has <pb n="378" facs="0409"
                            xml:id="pg_378"/>helped your situation; but it has not resolved the
                        problem. It is in this sense that I feel both so frustrated and powerless
                        when issues such as the Moscow Embassy signal<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">The
                            media were reporting that Embassy personnel in Moscow had been exposed
                            to “dangerous levels of radiation stemming from some type of
                            sophisticated Soviet listening or jamming equipment.” (Terence Hunt,

                        best will in the world—and with all of the right instincts about its impact
                        on U.S.-Soviet relations—there is no way, in the long run, that you could
                        keep this from becoming a substantial issue. And the harder you try, and the
                        longer you hold off from expressing your outrage, the more damage will be
                        done to you. I do not mean to get drawn off into a frivolous discussion of
                        an essentially tactical problem; nor am I recommending any particular course
                        of action with regard to the signal. I simply cite this as an example of the
                        sort of problem we are going to have more of and warn you that as you
                        address the issue of how to proceed you will need to think more carefully
                        than you have in the past about the impact on your personal position both in
                        Washington and around the country.</p>
                    <p>—You have, as I indicated in my cable, begun to lose your ability to

                        belief that your speeches from now on must be shorter (20–30 minutes) and
                        must focus in on one or two discreet themes. With all due respect to the

                        beginning to sound alike. While that may be okay in terms of the specific
                        audience to which you are speaking (and which is unlikely to see you again
                        in the flesh), it won’t wash with the press and television.</p>

                            relations, U.S. relations with developing countries, the values which
                            should govern U.S. foreign policy, and the objectives toward which U.S.

                        since (particularly including <persName corresp="#p_RJ_1">Scotty
                            Reston</persName>) have tended to confirm: the American people feel we
                        have lost the “moral” basis of our foreign policy. We stand for nothing and
                        are in a totally pragmatic and opportunistic mode. This is not either your
                        fault or of your making but it is a factor in the changing attitude toward
                        you. In a sense you are a victim of your own success. You have demonstrated
                        a remarkable ability in the Middle East, in Europe, with the Soviets, with
                        the Chinese, etc., to deal brilliantly with immediate problems but there is
                        a lack of the Kennedyesque moralism which Americans so like and which gives
                        us a sense of purpose and uniqueness. In a sense we are tired of making
                        money, making love, and making do; I suspect there is a certain subliminal
                        sense of shame over what we seem to have become and a largely unconscious
                        seeking for the moral simplicities of the past. You have great trouble in
                        talking to the American people about these moral verities but they hunger
                        for it and I think we continue to ignore it at our peril.</p>
                    <p>—The lame duck syndrome is beginning to hurt. You are beginning to be thought
                        of like yesterday’s newspaper simply because everyone recognizes that you
                        will not be next year’s Secretary of State. This is understandable and to
                        some degree inevitable. But there are some things that can be done about
                        this and I will speak of these later.</p>
                    <p>—We have tended to slip into a reactive posture, and at times a grumpy one at
                        that. In retrospect your last press conference was an important benchmark in
                        this regard because you came across as tired and touchy. Words like
                        “malicious,” “outrageous,” etc must become the exception not the rule
                        because the more you use them the less they have meaning and the more you
                        seem on the defensive.</p>

                    <p>—First and foremost in my view is a need for you to take on an optimistic
                        tone. As <persName corresp="#p_RJ_1">Scotty Reston</persName> said today, if
                        you compare the third quarter of this century with the first two quarters
                        thereof, we don’t really look so bad, no matter how painful the period from
                        1950 to 1975 might have been. We’ve had no world war. Social and economic
                        justice have been strengthened, not weakened in the United States, nations
                        have gained their freedom, etc. Thus for America to go through their
                        bicentennial in a mood of despair is neither sensible nor good history. Our
                        third century can be our best century. And no one else is playing this
                        theme, or at least playing it well and eloquently, and you can. And it will
                        not be out of character for you nor be seen to be a change in your
                        style.</p>
                    <p>—Another thing that you perhaps more than anyone else in America can bring to
                        this country is a sense of perspective. The American people are now so
                        preoccupied with matters of the moment that they are captured and captivated
                        by anyone who can present them with a sense of perspective, particularly
                        when it is simply and optimistically put.</p>
                    <p>—I continue to believe in the “don’t tread on me” approach (I have cleaned
                        the language up a bit because Millie<note n="9" xml:id="d70fn9">Mildred
                            Leatherman, <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>’s
                            Personal Assistant.</note> is typing this). But if we follow this
                        principle it ought to be done on our terms, on the basis of our timing, and
                        not simply day-to-day reactions to outrageous comments. Some of the latter
                        is necessary as well but it ought to be done in moderation.</p>
                    <p>—The lame duck disability needs to be offset by hints that you will be around
                        and a major part of the foreign policy process for the next two decades no
                        matter who wins the election this year. People need to begin to understand
                        that you will be a force to be reckoned with in foreign policy—your life’s
                        work—whether you are in or out of office. We need to think about ways to get
                        this point across. People need to remember that your teeth are sharp now and
                        are likely to be for some time to come.</p>
                    <p>—People need to get a sense that you are holding the place together in a
                        statesmanlike fashion while others play their games for their own personal
                        profit. You have nothing to gain by staying other than your deep sense of
                        duty and responsibility to the country. Thus, the important issue for you
                        over the course of the next few months is at least as much what you say as
                        what you do. The great historical accomplishments of the past seven
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> years will remain no
                        matter what happens. What you have yet to contribute is a sense of purpose,
                        perspective and hope for the future.</p>
                    <pb n="381" facs="0412" xml:id="pg_381"/>
                    <p>—I feel very strongly that we must find some way to give you more time to
                        devote to individual and group meetings with Congressmen and Senators, and
                        opinion leaders around the country, and more time to devote to careful and
                        in fact meticulous planning on how you can be most effective in the months
                        ahead. This means, I believe, that you must—despite your strong prejudice
                        against it—consciously turn over more of the operations of this Department
                        to your subordinates. They will make mistakes, yes. But you will have more
                        time to think and give the major issues of the moment a sense of coherence
                        that only you can bring to them.</p>
                    <p>—Another theme that occurs to me is that when America wouldn’t do a whole
                        range of things at a time when it had either a nuclear monopoly or vast
                        nuclear superiority, how can we expect to do those things in today’s
                        world.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Conclusions.</p>
                    <p>I have rambled but it is difficult not to do so at the current state of my
                        thinking. I very much believe that you ought to do one or two speeches a
                        month picking on these themes as you can and developing them in a variety of
                        ways. I continue to believe that one effective method of getting our point
                        across is to examine alternatives to the policies we have been following for
                        the last seven years. In this regard I still believe that a speech on
                        détente that dwells on alternatives could be a useful thing for you and
                        would no more identify you as defender of détente than you already are. But
                        done properly you could put the opposition on the defensive. And done with
                        humor, directed at your opponents (though not by name) rather than yourself,
                        it might well have a devastating effect.</p>
                    <p>I know my suggestions sound simple when compared to the magnitude of the
                        problems I have described. But I think it would be a mistake to believe that

                    <p rend="center">America’s Permanent Interests</p>
                    <p>I deeply appreciate the honor you bestow upon me today, not only because it
                        is given me by old Massachusetts friends but also for the name it bears.
                        Throughout his long career as legislator, Governor, and Secretary of State,
                        Christian Herter<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">Secretary of State from 1959
                            until 1961.</note> embodied the ideals of selfless public service and
                        responsible patriotism which have always marked our nation’s great leaders.
                        Most of all, Christian Herter was a man who had faith in his country and its
                        goodness. He understood the decisive role this nation must play in the world
                        for security and progress and justice.</p>
                    <p>In this election year, some 10 years after Chris Herter’s death, we would all
                        do well to remember his wisdom. For America is still the great and good
                        country he knew it was, and our participation in the international scene
                        remains decisive if our era is to know peace and a better life for mankind.
                        We must never forget that this nation has permanent interests and concerns
                        that must be preserved through and beyond this election year.</p>
                    <p>This can be a time of national renewal—when Americans freely renegotiate
                        their social compact. Or if the quest for short-term political gain prevails
                        over all other considerations, it can be a period of misleading
                        oversimplification, further divisiveness, and sterile recrimination.</p>
                    <p>This Administration has for many months been prepared to put its policies,
                        its premises, and its design for the future before the American people. The
                        President has often spoken about our concerns and hopes in the world. In the
                        past 14 months alone, I have given 17 major speeches, some 20 major news
                        conferences, and countless interviews across this country, and I have
                        testified 39 times before congressional committees.</p>
                    <p>Certainly there is room for differences on the policies to be pursued in a
                        complex and dangerous world. But those who challenge cur<pb n="383"
                            facs="0414" xml:id="pg_383"/>rent policies have an obligation to go
                        beyond criticisms, slogans, and abuse and set forth in detail their premises
                        and alternatives, the likely costs, opportunities, and risks.</p>
                    <p>America has come through a difficult time—when our institutions have been
                        under challenge, our purposes doubted, and our will questioned. The time has
                        come, as <persName corresp="#p_SAE3_1">Adlai Stevenson</persName>
                        <note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">Former Governor of Illinois <persName

                        “talk sense to the American people.” As a nation we face new dangers and
                        opportunities; neither will wait for our decisions next November, and both
                        can be profoundly affected by what we say and do in the meantime. Complex
                        realities cannot be resolved or evaded by nostalgic simplicities.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the turmoil of this decade, our foreign policy has pursued our
                        fundamental national goals with energy and consistent purpose:</p>
                    <p>—We are at peace for the first time in over a decade. No American fighting
                        men are engaged in combat anywhere in the world.</p>
                    <p>—Relations with our friends and allies in the Atlantic community and with
                        Japan have never been stronger.</p>
                    <p>—A new and durable relationship with the People’s Republic of China has been
                        opened and fostered.</p>
                    <p>—Confrontation in the heart of Europe has been eased. A four-power agreement
                        on Berlin has replaced a decade and a half of crisis and confrontation.</p>
                    <p>—We negotiated an interim agreement limiting strategic arms with the Soviet
                        Union which forestalled the numerical expansion of Soviet strategic programs
                        while permitting us to undertake needed programs of our own.</p>
                    <p>—We are now negotiating a long-term agreement which, if successfully
                        concluded, will for the first time in history set an upper limit on total
                        numbers of strategic weapons, requiring the Soviet Union to dismantle some
                        of its existing systems.</p>
                    <p>—Significant progress toward a durable settlement in the Middle East has been
                        made. Much work and many dangers remain, but the peace process is underway
                        for the first time since the creation of the State of Israel.</p>
                    <p>—There is a new maturity and impetus to our relations with Latin America
                        reflecting changing realities in the hemisphere and the growing importance
                        of these countries on the international scene.</p>
                    <pb n="384" facs="0415" xml:id="pg_384"/>
                    <p>—The United States has taken the role of global leadership in putting forward
                        a comprehensive agenda for a new and mutually beneficial relationship
                        between the developed and developing nations.</p>
                    <p>—We have defended human rights and dignity in all international bodies as
                        well as in our bilateral relations.</p>
                    <p>This is a record of American accomplishment that transcends partisanship, for
                        much of it was accomplished with the cooperation of both parties. It
                        reflects the ideals of the American people. It portends for this nation a
                        continuing role of moral and political leadership—if we have the
                        understanding, the will, and the unity to seize the opportunity history has
                        given us.</p>
                    <p>Thirty years ago this country began its first sustained peacetime involvement
                        in foreign affairs. We achieved great things, and we can continue to do so
                        as long as we are prepared to face the fact that we live in a more complex
                        time:</p>
                    <p>—Today the Soviet Union is a superpower. Nothing we could have done would
                        have halted this evolution after the impetus that two generations of
                        industrial and technological advance have given to Soviet military and
                        economic growth. But together with others we must assure that Russian power
                        and influence are not translated into an expansion of Soviet control and
                        dominance beyond the U.S.S.R.’s borders. This is prerequisite to a more
                        constructive relationship.</p>
                    <p>—Today scores of new nations have come into being, creating new centers of
                        influence. These nations make insistent claims on the global system, testing
                        their new economic power and seeking a greater role and share in the world’s
                        prosperity.</p>
                    <p>—Today the forces of democracy are called upon to show renewed creativity and
                        vision. In a world of complexity—in a world of equilibrium and coexistence,
                        of competition and interdependence—it is our democratic values that give
                        meaning to our sacrifice and purpose to our exertions. Thus the cohesion of
                        the industrial democracies has a moral as well as a political and economic
                        significance.</p>
                    <p>Americans are a realistic people who have never considered the definition of
                        a challenge as a prophecy of doom or a sign of pessimism. Instead, we have
                        seen it as a call to battle. “. . . the bravest,” said Thucydides, “are
                        surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and
                        danger alike, and yet notwithstanding go out to meet it.” That has always
                        been the test of democracy—and it has always been the strength of the
                        American people.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Equilibrium and Peace</p>
                    <p>Let me now deal with America’s permanent interests: peace, progress, and
                        justice.</p>
                    <pb n="385" facs="0416" xml:id="pg_385"/>
                    <p>Since the dawn of the nuclear age, the world’s fears of catastrophe and its
                        hopes for peace have hinged on the relationship between the United States
                        and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>In an era when two nations have the power to visit utter devastation on the
                        world in a matter of hours, there can be no greater imperative than assuring
                        that the relationship between the superpowers be managed effectively and
                        rationally.</p>
                    <p>This is an unprecedented task. Historically, a conflict of ideology and
                        geopolitical interests such as that which characterizes the current
                        international scene has almost invariably led to conflict. But in the age of
                        thermonuclear weapons and strategic equality, humanity could not survive
                        such a repetition of history. No amount of tough rhetoric can change these
                        realities. The future of our nation and of mankind depends on how well we
                        avoid confrontation without giving up vital interests and how well we
                        establish a more hopeful and stable relationship without surrender of
                        principle.</p>
                    <p>We therefore face the necessity of a dual policy. On the one hand, we are
                        determined to prevent Soviet military power from being used for political
                        expansion; we will firmly discourage and resist adventurist policies. But at
                        the same time, we cannot escalate every political dispute into a central
                        crisis; nor can we rest on identifying foreign policy with crisis
                        management. We have an obligation to work for a more positive future. We
                        must couple opposition to pressure and irresponsibility with concerned
                        efforts to build a more cooperative world.</p>
                    <p>History can inform—or mislead—us in this quest.</p>
                    <p>For a generation after World War II, statesmen and nations were traumatized
                        by the experience of Munich; they believed that history had shown the folly
                        of permitting an adversary to gain a preponderance of power. This was and
                        remains a crucial lesson.</p>
                    <p>A later generation was chastened by the experience of Viet-Nam; it is
                        determined that America shall never again overextend and exhaust itself by
                        direct involvement in remote wars with no clear strategic significance.
                        This, too, is a crucial lesson.</p>
                    <p>But equally important and too often neglected is the lesson learned by an
                        earlier generation. Before the outbreak of the First World War, there was a
                        virtual equilibrium of power. Through crisis after crisis, nations moved to
                        confrontation and then retreated to compromise. Stability was taken for
                        granted until—without any conscious decision to overturn the international
                        structure—a crisis much like any other went out of control. Nation after
                        nation slid into a war whose causes they did not understand but from which
                        they could not extricate themselves. The result was the death of tens of
                        millions, the destruction of the global order, and domestic upheavals whose
                        consequences still torment mankind.</p>
                    <pb n="386" facs="0417" xml:id="pg_386"/>
                    <p>If we are to learn from history, we cannot pick and choose the lessons from
                        which we will draw inspiration. The history of this century tells us:</p>
                    <p>—That an imbalance of power encourages aggression;</p>
                    <p>—That overcommitment cannot be sustained domestically; and</p>
                    <p>—That an equilibrium based on constant confrontation will ultimately end in
                        cataclysm.</p>
                    <p>But the lessons of history are never automatic; each generation must apply
                        them to concrete circumstances.</p>
                    <p>There is no question that peace rests, in the first instance, on the
                        maintenance of a balance of global stability. Without the ultimate sanction
                        of power, conciliation soon becomes surrender. Moderation is a virtue only
                        in those who are thought to have a choice.</p>
                    <p>No service is done to the nation by those who portray an exaggerated specter
                        of Soviet power and of American weakness, by those who hesitate to resist
                        when we are challenged, or by those who fail to see the opportunities we
                        have to shape the U.S.-Soviet relationship by our own confident action.</p>
                    <p>Soviet strength is uneven; the weaknesses and frustrations of the Soviet
                        system are glaring and have been clearly documented. Despite the inevitable
                        increase in its power, the Soviet Union remains far behind us and our allies
                        in any overall assessment of military, economic, and technological strength;
                        it would be reckless in the extreme for the Soviet Union to challenge the
                        industrial democracies. And Soviet society is no longer insulated from the
                        influences and attractions of the outside world or impervious to the need
                        for external contacts.</p>
                    <p>The great industrial democracies possess the means to counter Soviet
                        expansion and to moderate Soviet behavior. We must not abdicate this
                        responsibility by weakening ourselves either by failing to support our
                        defenses or refusing to use our power in defense of our interests; we must,
                        along with our allies, always do what is necessary to maintain our
                        security.</p>
                    <p>It is true that we cannot be the world’s policeman. Not all local wars and
                        regional conflicts affect global stability or America’s national interest.
                        But if one superpower systematically exploits these conflicts for its own
                        advantage and tips the scales decisively by its intervention, gradually the
                        overall balance will be affected. If adventurism is allowed to succeed in
                        local crises, an ominous precedent of wider consequence is set. Other
                        nations will adjust their policies to their perception of the dominant
                        trend. Our ability to control future crises will diminish. And if this
                        pattern is not broken, America will ultimately face harder choices, higher
                        costs, and more severe crises.</p>
                    <pb n="387" facs="0418" xml:id="pg_387"/>
                    <p>But our obligation goes beyond the balance of power. An equilibrium is too
                        precarious a foundation for our long-term future. There is no tranquillity
                        in a balance of terror constantly contested. We must avoid the twin
                        temptations of provocation and escapism. Our course must be steady and not
                        reflect momentary fashions; it must be a policy that our adversaries
                        respect, our allies support, and our people believe in and sustain.</p>
                    <p>Therefore we have sought with the Soviet Union to push back the shadow of
                        nuclear catastrophe—by settling concrete problems such as Berlin so as to
                        ease confrontations and negotiating on limitation of strategic arms so as to
                        slow the arms race. And we have held out the prospect of cooperative
                        relations in the economic and other fields if political conditions permit
                        their implementation and further development.</p>
                    <p>It goes without saying that this process requires reciprocity. It cannot
                        survive a constant attempt to seek unilateral advantage. It cannot,
                        specifically, survive any more Angolas. If the Soviet Union is ready to face
                        genuine coexistence, we are prepared to make every effort to shape a pattern
                        of restraint and mutual interest which will give coexistence a more reliable
                        and positive character making both sides conscious of what would be lost by
                        confrontation and what can be gained by cooperation.</p>
                    <p>And we are convinced that when a vigorous response to Soviet encroachment is
                        called for, the President will have the support of the American people—and
                        of our allies—to the extent that he can demonstrate that the crisis was
                        imposed upon us; that it did not result from opportunities we missed to
                        improve the prospects of peace.</p>
                    <p>No policy will soon, if ever, eliminate the competition and irreconcilable
                        ideological differences between the United States and the Soviet Union. Nor
                        will it make all interests compatible. We are engaged in a protracted
                        process with inevitable ups and downs. But there is no alternative to the
                        policy of penalties for adventurism and incentives for restraint. What do
                        those who speak so glibly about “one-way streets” or “preemptive
                        concessions” propose concretely that this country do? What precisely has
                        been given up? What level of confrontation do they seek? What threats would
                        they make? What risks would they run? What precise changes in our defense
                        posture, what level of expenditure over what period of time, do they
                        advocate? How, concretely, do they suggest managing the U.S.-Soviet
                        relationship in an era of strategic equality?</p>
                    <p>It is time we heard answers to these questions.</p>
                    <p>In short we must—and we shall—pursue the two strands of our policy toward the
                        Soviet Union: Firmness in the face of pressure and <pb n="388" facs="0419"
                            xml:id="pg_388"/>the vision to work for a better future. This is well
                        within our capacities. We owe this to our people, to our future, to our
                        allies, and to the rest of mankind.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The World Community</p>
                    <p>The upheavals of this century have produced another task—the fundamental need
                        of reshaping the structure of international relations. For the first time in
                        history the international system has become truly global. Decolonization and
                        the expansion of the world economy have given birth to scores of new nations
                        and new centers of power and initiative.</p>
                    <p>Our current world, numbering nearly 150 nations, can be the seedbed for
                        growing economic warfare, political instability, and ideological
                        confrontation—or it can become a community marked by unprecedented
                        international collaboration. The interdependence of nations—the
                        indivisibility of our security and our prosperity—can accelerate our common
                        progress or our common decline.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, just as we seek to move beyond a balance of power in East-West
                        relations, so must we transcend tests of strength in North-South relations
                        and build a true world community.</p>
                    <p>We do so in our own self-interest, for today’s web of economic relationships
                        links the destinies of all mankind. The price and supply of energy, the
                        conditions of trade, the expansion of world food production, the
                        technological bases for economic development, the protection of the world’s
                        environment, the rules of law that govern the world’s oceans and outer
                        space—these are concerns that affect all nations and that can be
                        satisfactorily addressed only in a framework of international
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Here, too, we need to sustain a complex policy. We must resist tactics of
                        confrontation, but our larger goal must be to shape new international
                        relationships that will last over decades to come. We will not be stampeded
                        by pressures or threats. But it is in our own interest to create an
                        international economic system that all nations will regard as legitimate
                        because they have a stake in it and because they consider it just.</p>
                    <p>As the world’s strongest power, the United States could survive an era of
                        economic warfare. But even we would be hurt, and no American true to the
                        humane heritage of his country could find satisfaction in the world that
                        confrontation would bring in its wake. The benefits of common effort are so
                        apparent and the prospects of economic strife so damaging that there is no
                        moral or practical alternative to a world of expanded collaboration.</p>

                        the lead in offering programs of practical cooperation. We have
                        presented—and are vigorously following through on—a wide range of proposals
                        to safeguard export earnings, accelerate industrial and agricultural growth,
                        better conditions of trade and investment in key commodities, and meet the
                        plight of the poorest countries. In every area of concern we have proposed
                        forms of collaboration among <hi rend="italic">all</hi> nations, including
                        the other industrial countries, the newly wealthy oil producers, and the
                        developing countries themselves.</p>
                    <p>It is the West—and overwhelmingly this nation—that has the resources, the
                        technology, the skills, the organizational ability, and the good will that
                        attract and invite the cooperation of the developing nations. In the global
                        dialogue among the industrial and developing worlds, the Communist nations
                        are conspicuous by their absence and, indeed, by their irrelevance.</p>
                    <p>Yet at the very moment when the industrial democracies are responding to the
                        aspirations of the developing countries, many of the same countries attempt
                        to extort what has in fact been freely offered. Lopsided voting, unworkable
                        resolutions, and arbitrary procedures too often dominate the United Nations
                        and other international bodies. Nations which originally chose nonalignment
                        to shield themselves from the pressures of global coalitions have themselves
                        formed a rigid, ideological, confrontationist coalition of their own. One of
                        the most evident blocs in the world today is, ironically, the almost
                        automatic alignment of the nonaligned.</p>
                    <p>The United States remains ready to respond responsibly and positively to
                        countries which seriously seek justice and an equitable world economic
                        system. But progress depends on a spirit of mutual respect, realism, and
                        practical cooperation. Let there be no mistake about it: extortion will not
                        work and will not be supinely accepted. The stakes are too high for
                        self-righteous rhetoric or adolescent posturing.</p>
                    <p>At issue is not simply the economic arrangements of the next quarter century
                        but the legitimacy of the international order.</p>
                    <pb n="390" facs="0421" xml:id="pg_390"/>
                    <p>Technology and the realities of interdependence have given our generation the
                        opportunity to determine the relationships between the developed and
                        developing countries over the next quarter century. It is the quality of
                        statesmanship to recognize that our necessity, our practical aspirations,
                        and our moral purpose are linked. The United States is ready for that
                        challenge.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Moral Unity of the Great Democracies</p>
                    <p>Our efforts to build peace and progress reflect our deep-seated belief in
                        freedom and in the hope of a better future for all mankind. These are values
                        we share with our closest allies, the great industrial democracies.</p>
                    <p>The resilience of our countries in recovering from economic difficulty and in
                        consolidating our cooperation has an importance far beyond our immediate
                        well-being. For while foreign policy is unthinkable without an element of
                        pragmatism, pragmatism without underlying moral purpose is like a rudderless
                        ship.</p>
                    <p>Together, the United States and our allies have maintained the global peace
                        and sustained the world economy for more than 30 years. The spirit of
                        innovation and progress in our societies has no match anywhere, certainly
                        not in societies laying claim to being “revolutionary.” Rarely in history
                        have alliances survived—let alone flourished—as ours have in vastly changing
                        global and geopolitical conditions. The ideals of the industrial democracies
                        give purpose to our efforts to improve relations with the East, to the
                        dialogue with the Third World, and to many other spheres of common
                        endeavor.</p>
                    <p>Our ties with the great industrial democracies are therefore not alliances of
                        convenience but a union of principle in defense of values and a way of
                        life.</p>
                    <p>It is in this context that we must be concerned about the possibility of
                        Communist parties coming to power—or sharing in power—in governments in
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> countries. Ultimately, the
                        decision must, of course, be made by the voters of the countries concerned.
                        But no one should expect that this question is not of concern to this
                        government.</p>
                    <p>Whether some of the Communist parties in Western Europe are in fact
                        independent of Moscow cannot be determined when their electoral
                        self-interest so overwhelmingly coincides with their claims.</p>
                    <p>Their internal procedures—their Leninist principles and dogmas—remain the
                        antithesis of democratic parties. And were they to gain power, they would do
                        so after having advocated for decades programs and values detrimental to our
                        traditional ties. By that record, they would inevitably give low priority to
                        security and Western defense efforts, which are essential not only to
                        Europe’s freedom but to maintaining the world balance of power. They would
                        be tempted to <pb n="391" facs="0422" xml:id="pg_391"/>orient their
                        economies to a much greater extent toward the East. We would have to expect
                        that Western European governments in which Communists play a dominant role
                        would, at best, steer their countries’ policies toward the positions of the
                        nonaligned.</p>
                    <p>The political solidarity and collective defense of the West, and thus <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, would be inevitably weakened, if not
                        undermined. And in this country, the commitment of the American people to
                        maintain the balance of power in Europe, justified though it might be on
                        pragmatic geopolitical grounds, would lack the moral base on which it has
                        stood for 30 years.</p>
                    <p>We consider the unity of the great industrial democracies crucial to all we
                        do in the world. For this reason we have sought to expand our cooperation to
                        areas beyond our mutual defense—in improved political consultation, in
                        coordinating our approaches to negotiations with the East, in reinforcing
                        our respective economic policies, in developing a common energy policy, and
                        in fashioning common approaches for the increasingly important dialogue with
                        the developing nations. We have made remarkable progress in all these areas.
                        We are determined to continue. Our foreign policy has no higher
                        priority.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Debate at Home</p>
                    <p>This, then, is the design of our foreign policy:</p>
                    <p>—We have the military and economic power, together with our allies, to
                        prevent aggression.</p>
                    <p>—We have the self-confidence and vision to go beyond confrontation to a
                        reduction of tensions and ultimately a more cooperative world.</p>
                    <p>—We have the resources, technology, and organizational genius to build a new
                        relationship with the developing nations.</p>
                    <p>—We have the moral courage to hold high, together with our allies, the
                        banners of freedom in a turbulent and changing world.</p>
                    <p>The challenges before us are monumental. But it is not every generation that
                        is given the opportunity to shape a new international order. If the
                        opportunity is missed, we shall live in a world of chaos and danger. If it
                        is realized we will have entered an era of peace and progress and
                        justice.</p>
                    <p>But we can realize our hopes only as a united people. Our challenge—and its
                        solution—lies in ourselves. Our greatest foreign policy problem is our
                        divisions at home. Our greatest foreign policy need is national cohesion and
                        a return to the awareness that in foreign policy we are all engaged in a
                        common national endeavor.</p>
                    <p>The world watches with amazement—our adversaries with glee and our friends
                        with growing dismay—how America seems bent on <pb n="392" facs="0423"
                            xml:id="pg_392"/>eroding its influence and destroying its achievements
                        in world affairs through an orgy of recrimination.</p>
                    <p>They see our policies in Africa, the eastern Mediterranean, in Latin America,
                        in East-West relations undermined by arbitrary congressional actions that
                        may take decades to undo.</p>
                    <p>They see our intelligence system gravely damaged by unremitting,
                        undiscriminating attack.</p>
                    <p>They see a country virtually incapable of behaving with the discretion that
                        is indispensable for diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>They see revelations of malfeasance abroad on the part of American firms
                        wreak grave damage on the political structures of friendly nations. Whatever
                        wrongs were committed—reprehensible as they are—should be dealt with in a
                        manner consistent with our own judicial procedures and with the dignity of
                        allied nations.</p>
                    <p>They see some critics suddenly pretending that the Soviets are 10 feet tall
                        and that America, despite all the evidence to the contrary, is becoming a
                        second-rate nation. They know these erroneous and reckless allegations to be
                        dangerous, because they may, if continued, persuade allies and adversaries
                        of our weakness, tempting the one to accommodation and the other to
                        adventurism.</p>
                    <p>They see this Administration—which has been condemned by one set of critics
                        for its vigorous reaction to expansionism in Southeast Asia, in the Middle
                        East, in Africa—simultaneously charged by another group of opponents with
                        permitting unilateral Soviet gains.</p>
                    <p>They see that the Administration whose defense budgets have been cut some $39
                        billion by the Congress in the past seven years is simultaneously charged
                        with neglecting American defenses.</p>
                    <p>The American people see all this, too, and wonder when it will end. They know
                        that we cannot escape either our responsibilities or the geopolitical
                        realities of the world around us. For a great nation that does not manage
                        events will soon be overwhelmed by them.</p>
                    <p>If one group of critics undermines arms control negotiations and cuts off the
                        prospect of more constructive ties with the Soviet Union while another group
                        cuts away at our defense budgets and intelligence services and thwarts
                        American resistance to Soviet adventurism, both combined will—whether they
                        have intended it or not—end by wrecking the nation’s ability to conduct a
                        strong, creative, moderate, and prudent foreign policy. The result will be
                        paralysis, no matter who wins in November. And if America cannot act, others
                        will, and we and all the free peoples of the world will pay the price.</p>
                    <p>So our problem is at once more complex and simpler than in times past. The
                        challenges are unprecedented but the remedies are in our own hands. This
                        Administration has confidence in the strength, resil<pb n="393" facs="0424"
                            xml:id="pg_393"/>ience, and vigor of America. If we summon the American
                        spirit and restore our unity, we will have a decisive and positive impact on
                        a world which, more than ever, affects our lives and cries out for our
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>Those who have faith in America will tell the American people the truth:</p>
                    <p>—That we are strong and at peace;</p>
                    <p>—That there are no easy or final answers to our problems;</p>
                    <p>—That we must conduct a long-term and responsible foreign policy, without
                        escape and without respite;</p>
                    <p>—That what is attainable at any one moment will inevitably fall short of the
                        ideal;</p>
                    <p>—That the reach of our power and purpose has its limits;</p>
                    <p>—That nevertheless we have the strength and determination to defend our
                        interests and the conviction to uphold our values; and finally,</p>
                    <p>—That we have the opportunity to leave our children a more cooperative, more
                        just, and more peaceful world than we found.</p>
                    <p>In this Bicentennial year, we celebrate ideals which began to take shape
                        around the shores of Massachusetts Bay some 350 years ago. We have
                        accomplished great things as a united people. There is much yet to do. This
                        country’s work in the world is not a burden but a triumph—and the measure of
                        greatness yet to come.</p>
                    <p>Americans have always made history rather than let history chart our course.
                        We, the present generation of Americans, will do no less. So let this year
                        mark the end of our divisions. Let it usher in an era of national
                        reconciliation and rededication by all Americans to their common destiny.
                        Let us have a clear vision of what is before us—glory and danger alike—and
                        go forward together to meet it.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Triangular Relationship of the United States, the U.S.S.R.,
                        and the People’s Republic of China</p>
                    <p>I appreciate this opportunity to participate in your committee’s examination
                        of one of the most critical subjects in foreign policy: the triangular
                        relationship of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People’s
                        Republic of China. Our relations with the world’s largest country and with
                        the world’s most populous country are cardinal elements in our pursuit of a
                        more secure and moderate international system.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union possesses great industrial prowess and military strength. It
                        is directed by leaders dedicated to developing Soviet power and enhancing
                        Soviet influence. Aside from ourselves, only the U.S.S.R. has strategic
                        capabilities and conventional forces with a global reach. It is thus at once
                        our principal rival in a geopolitical contest and an inevitable partner if
                        we are to help shape a more positive globe. There can be no higher
                        imperative than insuring that the vast nuclear arsenals we each hold are
                        never used—for the ensuing holocaust could engulf not only our two countries
                        but civilization itself. Our own security and global stability hinge
                        fundamentally upon the success of our endeavors to manage this
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>China as well is a vast nation, with one-quarter of the world’s population, a
                        long and rich history, impressive economic potential, a growing nuclear
                        capability, and substantial political influence. There can be no lasting
                        equilibrium in Asia, and ultimately in the world, without China’s
                        constructive participation. Building a positive and durable relationship
                        with that nation is at the heart of our international policy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Policy Toward the U.S.S.R.</p>
                    <p>The relationship with the Soviet Union has been a central challenge for
                        America for three decades. The power of the U.S.S.R. is continuing to grow.
                        The United States could not have prevented the Soviet Union’s rise to the
                        stature of a superpower, nor can we make its power disappear. Our objective
                        is to create inhibitions against the Soviets <pb n="395" facs="0426"
                            xml:id="pg_395"/>using their strength in ways that jeopardize our
                        interests or those of our friends and, over time, to channel their energies
                        in more positive directions. This is no simple task, for the conditions are
                        unprecedented: we have competing national interests; our ideologies and
                        values clash; we each possess arsenals of awesome destructiveness; and each
                        of us can project its influence throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> have recently set
                        forth our approach toward the Soviet Union in considerable detail. Let me,
                        therefore, just briefly review the highlights.</p>
                    <p>We must pursue a complex dual policy. On the one hand, we need to demonstrate
                        strength and resolve. We and our allies must maintain levels of military
                        capability sufficient to dissuade the Soviet Union from seeking to further
                        its positions by force. And we must firmly oppose adventurism.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, we must seek to shape more constructive bilateral
                        relations and global patterns of restraint and cooperation. We must work for
                        reliable agreements to limit strategic arms on both sides. We must be
                        prepared to resolve political disputes through negotiation. Developing
                        bilateral ties in commercial and many other areas on the basis of reciprocal
                        benefits is an important part of this process; it can help encourage Soviet
                        interests in improved relations and moderate international conduct.</p>
                    <p>In short, we need both to maintain penalties for irresponsible Soviet
                        behavior and to develop incentives for Moscow to pursue a more constructive
                        course.</p>
                    <p>There have been positive accomplishments. We concluded one major agreement on
                        strategic arms; and we are working toward a comprehensive second accord
                        which—for the first time—would place a ceiling on the strategic arms race,
                        thus reducing the threat of nuclear war and enabling us to avoid
                        expenditures on forces that would have only marginal military or political
                        utility. We have eased tensions and negotiated solutions on a number of
                        problems; for example, the four-power agreement on Berlin defused one of the
                        traditional crisis areas. We have expanded our relations with the U.S.S.R.
                        in commerce, technology, and many other fields on the basis of mutual
                        benefit; for example, last year’s grain agreement, while helping to meet
                        Soviet requirements, assured profits to our farmers, alleviated pressures on
                        our prices, and protected our traditional foreign customers against
                        unrestricted Soviet forays into our market during future periods of short
                        supply.</p>
                    <p>If we have made significant progress on some fronts, problems remain on
                        others. Most serious is the imperative of preventing expansionism and the
                        exacerbation of regional conflicts. In Angola, the Soviet Union and a Cuban
                        expeditionary force intervened to impose a solu<pb n="396" facs="0427"
                            xml:id="pg_396"/>tion on a turbulent local struggle. To allow such a
                        pattern to develop without opposition would create a dangerous destabilizing
                        trend in world affairs. Leaders of nations in Africa and elsewhere would
                        tailor their perceptions and decisions accordingly. Continued American
                        passivity would send misleading signals to the Soviet Union, and China as
                        well. We might well face harder choices and higher risks in the future.</p>
                    <p>We have made clear to Soviet leaders that persistent attempts to gain
                        unilateral advantage could not help but damage the state of our relations
                        and thereby undermine global stability.</p>
                    <p>Thus we face the long-term challenge of maintaining a stable balance and
                        striving to go beyond this to build a peaceful and secure world. While
                        Americans can reasonably disagree on the tactical details of our policy
                        toward Moscow, I believe that for the foreseeable future any Administration
                        will need to follow this two-track approach.</p>
                    <p>Let me now turn to our relations with the other major Communist state.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Policy Toward China</p>
                    <p>Mutual concerns and incentives prompted the United States and the People’s
                        Republic of China to launch a new beginning together after two decades of
                        hostility and isolation. Our shared interests provide the foundation for a
                        durable and growing relationship.</p>
                    <p>Positive relations with the People’s Republic of China offer us a variety of
                        benefits: improved prospects for preserving global equilibrium; reduced
                        dangers of conflict in Asia, an area where the interests of all the world’s
                        major powers intersect; the growth of mutually beneficial bilateral ties,
                        including cultural and educational exchanges, and commercial opportunities;
                        and possibilities for cooperation or compatible action on global issues.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese also derive advantages from this relationship: a hedge against
                        Soviet diplomatic and military pressures, broader access to the
                        international community, opportunities for trade and technology, and the
                        prospect of progress on the Taiwan question.</p>
                    <p>We and the Chinese share common concerns that the world remain free from
                        domination by military force or blackmail—“hegemony,” as we have described
                        it in our various communiqués. We have also agreed to pursue the
                        normalization of our relations. We remain dedicated to these objectives as
                        set forth in the Shanghai communiqué.</p>
                    <p>There has been significant progress. Extensive and wide-ranging talks between
                        our two leaderships have deepened mutual perceptions—reducing the risks of
                        miscalculations where we disagree and increasing the chances for parallel
                        actions where we agree. Our respective approaches to various regions and
                        problems often reinforce one <pb n="397" facs="0428" xml:id="pg_397"
                        />another. We have established liaison offices in each other’s capitals. We
                        have increased trade and promoted scientific and cultural exchanges.</p>
                    <p>The Taiwan question presents some difficult issues. We have acknowledged that
                        Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait maintain that there is but one
                        China, of which Taiwan is a part; and we do not challenge that position. We
                        have affirmed our own interest in a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue
                        by the Chinese themselves. And with that prospect in mind we have reduced
                        our forces on Taiwan—10,000 at the time the Shanghai communiqué was signed,
                        less than 2,500 now. This process will continue.</p>
                    <p>There is understanding on both sides about the pace at which our relations
                        have evolved. At the same time we cannot afford to be complacent. We see
                        important national interests served by a consolidation of this relationship.
                        We see no evidence thus far that foreign policy is a significant issue in
                        the current campaign with the P.R.C., although, as in any country, there is
                        a necessary relationship between domestic politics and the pursuit of
                        foreign policy objectives. The Chinese, in a variety of ways, continue to
                        signal to us their continuing interest in sustaining and developing
                        Sino-American relations. In any event, the crucial factor for the Chinese
                        will be their perception of the strength, steadiness, and vision of the
                        United States on the world scene.</p>
                    <p>The basic decisions on how we will complete the normalization process have
                        not yet been made, but the direction of our policy is clear. We are
                        confident that with mutual efforts we will move ahead progressively to
                        strengthen our ties.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Sino-Soviet Dispute</p>
                    <p>The Sino-Soviet dispute remains a fundamental feature of the contemporary
                        global setting.</p>
                    <p>The roots of this rivalry run deep. There are numerous and longstanding
                        territorial and political disputes. These are compounded by perceptions of
                        ideological heresy, racial tension, memories of past betrayals, and the
                        convictions of political leaders on both sides. The relationship is also
                        marked by the classic characteristics of rivalry between two powerful
                        neighbors. Mutual suspicions are reinforced by military buildups in the
                        border areas and intense competitive maneuvering for positions in Asia and
                        beyond.</p>
                    <p>While war is by no means unimaginable, it seems improbable when both sides
                        possess impressive deterrent capabilities. The more likely prospect is
                        continued confrontation and geopolitical competition. The basic conflicts of
                        interests, the clash of ideologies, the readiness of forces deployed on the
                        borders, the intensity of mutual suspicions—all suggest that the present
                        pattern will continue.</p>
                    <pb n="398" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_398"/>
                    <p>Nevertheless, we must not regard the Sino-Soviet confrontation as an
                        immutable condition. While renewal of a tight Sino-Soviet alliance is
                        difficult to conceive, at least a limited improvement in relations cannot be
                        ruled out. It is possible that the Russians and Chinese may come to see
                        incentives for moderating their bilateral relations—their desire for greater
                        diplomatic flexibility in their dealings with us and with others, the
                        lessening of at least border tensions, the openings caused by leadership
                        successions in both countries.</p>
                    <p>We have no crystal ball. Rather than speculate on the future course of
                        Sino-Soviet relations, let me specify more precisely the U.S.
                        perspective:</p>
                    <p>—We did not create the dispute. It springs from sources independent of our
                        will or our policy. To attempt to manipulate the rivalry, to meddle in it,
                        or to take sides would be dangerous, indeed self-defeating.</p>
                    <p>—At the same time, in a triangular relationship it is undeniably advantageous
                        for us to have better relations with each of the other two actors than they
                        have with one another. But it does not follow that we would want to see this
                        rivalry escalate into conflict. As history abundantly attests, large-scale
                        clashes among major powers are exceedingly difficult to contain. In addition
                        to tragic loss of life in the region, there would loom great dangers for
                        global stability.</p>
                    <p>—Neither can we genuinely wish to see the two major Communist powers locked
                        once again in close alliance. Clearly this would pose fresh dangers in the
                        world. A limited thaw in Sino-Soviet relations, however, would not
                        automatically redound to our disadvantage, provided it was not based on
                        shared opposition to the United States.</p>
                    <p>—Our interests compel us to pursue our well-established policies of seeking
                        improved relations with both the U.S.S.R. and China. Both courses are
                        essential for maintaining a global equilibrium and shaping a more peaceful
                        and positive international structure. The record to date suggests that
                        improvement in our ties with one does not harm our ties with the other.
                        Indeed, our relations with both countries were perhaps most active and
                        positive during the same period, in 1972–73.</p>
                    <p>—We therefore do not intend to be instructed by either party on the course we
                        should adopt toward its rival. Our policies must be dictated by our
                        interests, not by others’ injunctions. At the same time, we will make clear
                        that we are not colluding with, or accommodating, one at the expense of the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>—With both the Soviets and Chinese we have deep differences in national
                        interests and purposes. We also have ideologies and values that clash,
                        including our approach to human rights and individual freedom. We will not
                        maintain any illusions or attempt to hide our differences. But in the
                        thermonuclear age, we have an obligation to our <pb n="399" facs="0430"
                            xml:id="pg_399"/>people and the world to moderate our relationships. We
                        must seek to move not only from confrontation to coexistence but onward to
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>—Our success in managing our relations with both nations depends
                        fundamentally on the strength and vitality of our alliances with Western
                        Europe and Japan. We must preserve the integrity of those bonds if we are to
                        deal effectively with potential adversaries, and we must harmonize our
                        policies with our allies lest differential approaches generate competition
                        among friends. Our partnerships with the industrial democracies come first
                        in our diplomacy; they will not be jeopardized in the pursuit of other
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, the progress of our policies toward both the Soviets and the
                        Chinese requires a solid domestic foundation: our material strength, our
                        unity of purpose, our appreciation of the realities around us. Neither
                        Moscow nor Peking will respect us if we do not act with determination and
                        vision in the world. Thus our first priority in this aspect of our foreign
                        policy, as in all others, is to heal our divisions at home and act once
                        again as a confident, purposeful international power.</p>
                    <p>This is a complex policy, but it is dictated by the objective conditions of
                        international relations today. In the past Americans have had the luxury of
                        emphasizing one strand of policy at a time—either resistance to adventurism
                        or cooperation with others for mutual benefit. The challenge of our era—in a
                        world of competing values, nuclear weapons, and interdependence—is to pursue
                        both at the same time.</p>
                    <p>The issues at stake run far deeper than questions of any one faction or party
                        or Administration. The imperatives of shaping stable relations with the
                        Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China will be with us for as far
                        ahead as we can see. This long-range challenge, indeed all that we do in the
                        world, will crucially require the cohesion of the American people and
                        cooperation between the executive and legislative branches.</p>
                    <p>I remain confident that, after a turbulent decade, we will demonstrate our
                        resiliency and once again achieve peace at home so that we can better
                        promote peace in the world.</p>

                            Europeans and the Soviet Union an organic one.” (“A Soviet-East Europe

                        policies by 180°. The press focused on the use of the word organic, and
                        added the term union, which together, imply U.S. acceptance of Soviet
                        dominance of Eastern Europe. This assertion is incorrect.</p>
                    <p>—U.S. policy, in fact, encourages Eastern European trends towards greater
                        autonomy and the attendant dilution of Soviet influence.</p>
                    <p>—However, the U.S. must not be too zealous in encouraging greater national
                        independence because to do so would invite the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"

                    <p>—The issue for the U.S. is how to exploit autonomous trends in Eastern
                        Europe, and at the same time, get the Soviets to accept a situation whereby
                        their relationship with Eastern Europe is founded less on proximate Soviet

                        Europe is understandably upsetting to U.S. ethnic groups. Key legislators

                        high.</p>
                    <p>—Hearings before Congress on U.S. policy towards Eastern Europe are possible,
                        but they will be a problem because they will advertize our support for
                        greater Eastern European autonomy.</p>

                            corresp="#p_SH_1">Sonnenfeldt</persName> denied recent press reports
                        which link his policy statements on Eastern Europe to suggestions that the

                        under which the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would keep
                        the Western European communist parties out of allied governments and the
                        U.S. would not encourage autonomy in Eastern Europe. He disavowed a
                        U.S.-Soviet agreement on spheres of influence.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Sonnenfeldt</persName> asserted that the U.S.
                        cannot found its European policy on the notion that the deviant Western
                        European communists are more of a thorn in the side of the Soviets than they
                        are to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Sonnenfeldt</persName> contended that the U.S.
                        must be concerned with what would happen if Western European communists come
                        to power.</p>

                    <p>—The U.S. cannot campaign against Western communist parties, but we have and

                    <p>—Western Europe and the rise of communist parties is a far more serious issue
                        than the Eastern European issues.</p>
                    <p>—The professed independence of Western European communist parties is not an

                    <p>—U.S. academics have become fascinated with European communists and are
                        pressing State to approve more interchanges. Many academics believe
                        communists should share power and be forced to make the tough governmental
                        decisions. Others suggest that the Western European communists will be
                        fiercely independent and pro-defense.</p>

                        parties (such as the communists) must prove their bona fides in political
                        opposition. He considers it doubtful they will be pro-defense, since their
                        current prominence is based on economic issues, social improvements and
                        governmental efficiency; they would give defense spending a low
                        priority.</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Sonnenfeldt</persName> believes that Western
                        European communist parties are not subservient to Moscow, but neither are

                            memorandum that reads in part: “In addition to a specific action plan,
                            we still have to get at the strategic problem of convincing the various
                            African partners that the only real solution lies through us. This will
                            be much more difficult than the Middle East: the Arabs know that only we
                            have the capability to ‘deliver’ the Israelis; we have nothing like this
                            trump with the white regimes in Southern Africa that could be played
                            with the Africans. But there are nevertheless some similar assets in the
                            two situations: the fear of too-tight a Communist embrace as a threat to
                            their autonomy; our economic role and potential assistance; and the
                            intra-regional rivalries and antagonisms—some with a Soviet
                            dimension—from which we might derive leverage.”</note>

                        <gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARA_1">ARA</gloss>
                        are working on the Rhodesian and Cuban pieces of the Southern Africa puzzle.
                        This memorandum sketches the main outlines of an overall strategy to help
                        you and us fit all of the pieces together and begin to determine specific
                        steps.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Problem and Our Objectives</p>
                    <p>You have already delineated the principal parameters of the Southern Africa
                        problem that our strategy must address:</p>
                    <p>—To avert Soviet/Cuban action, and American inaction, which would extend the
                        Angola precedent, and sharpen perceptions of a pattern of decisive
                        Soviet/Cuban initiative and American irrelevance.</p>
                    <p>—To do what we can to help solve the problems of the area and satisfy the
                        legitimate aspirations of its people, both because it is right and because
                        our ability to contain the Soviets and Cubans in part depends on it.</p>
                    <p>—To avoid perceptions of American actions as concessions extorted from us
                        under pain of Soviet/Cuban involvement, because of its damaging effects in
                        Africa and globally.</p>
                    <p>The ultimate nightmare to be avoided is Soviet/Cuban combat intervention in
                        Southern Africa with widespread African support. Clearly our global
                        strategic interests would dictate some stiff action against the
                        Soviets/Cubans at the cost of sizeable damage to our standing in Africa and
                        domestic support—and Congress could block action in any case. This is the
                        central dilemma our strategy must be designed to head off. At the same time,
                        if this situation materializes, our <pb n="404" facs="0435" xml:id="pg_404"
                        />strategy should put us in the best position possible to move against the
                        Soviets/Cubans and to limit the fall-out. And we also wish to reduce the
                        Soviet/Cuban presence in Angola and the political muscle it gives them.</p>
                    <p>Certainly direct steps, or the threat of them, vis-à-vis the Soviets and
                        Cubans will be essential to inhibit their moves in Southern Africa. But as
                        you have often stated—for example in the case of Angola—action on this level
                        must be supported by the political and military facts on the ground locally.
                        Thus it will be essential to help shape these factors as well.</p>
                    <p>In short, we need to pursue the two tracks at once. By working to generate
                        momentum towards majority rule and self-determination in Southern Africa, we
                        have at least a chance of mitigating, if not foreclosing, the grounds for
                        Soviet/Cuban intervention—though we have to be pessimistic about how much we
                        or anyone else can really do, for example, to move Smith. Even so, in making
                        the effort we will carve out a role on the side of African aspirations that
                        is critical to our ability to muster the international support that a tough
                        line towards the Soviets/Cubans requires. Otherwise we will be accused of
                        sacrificing legitimate African objectives to our great power maneuvering,
                        leaving the Soviets and Cubans in the role of energetic defenders of justice
                        and progress. However deep the concerns of Africans, Europeans and some
                        Latins about the risks of outside intervention, this would make it well-nigh
                        impossible for them to side with us and oppose the Soviets and Cubans.
                        African states in particular that might want to sustain a close association
                        with us cannot do so either domestically or on the African scene if a <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> connection can be portrayed as inconsistent
                        with African aspirations.</p>
                    <p>Both tracks are also needed at home if we are to gain sufficient
                        Congressional and public support for either track. Liberals might be induced
                        to take firm action against the Soviets and Cubans if they see us
                        simultaneously moving to change the status quo in Southern Africa. At the
                        same time, the Soviet/Cuban dimension ironically gives us an opportunity to
                        win support from conservatives, that might otherwise be unavailable, for a
                        more active policy on majority rights and self-determination.</p>
                    <p>This still leaves us with the extortion dilemma. Any step-up in our support
                        for change in Southern Africa could contradict a basic message that we are
                        trying to get across—that there is nothing to be gained by Soviet/Cuban
                        intervention in Southern Africa or elsewhere. Thus—as we did in the Middle
                        East—we must make it clear to the Africans that they have to work with us,
                        if not through us; that we are not to be moved by the blackmail use of Cuban
                        troops.</p>
                    <p>This is one of the toughest, most complicating, aspects of our strategic
                        problem. But I think the answer is to ride <hi rend="italic">both</hi>
                        tracks of our policy <pb n="405" facs="0436" xml:id="pg_405"/>hard. In this
                        way the Africans will see that we represent an opportunity to help move
                        toward their goals but only if they take account of our geopolitical
                        concerns at the same time. And if we succeed, the very effectiveness of our
                        policy should upstage, and ultimately smother, the question of whether it
                        was forced by Soviet/Cuban involvement. Parallels are dangerous, but there
                        was some perception that our forward stance at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"

                        was overwhelmed by the vigor and substance of our policy, and its half-life

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The problem with the
                        Soviet Union is that détente is really right. Second, you will have to deal
                        with them after November. It really isn’t so that they are being
                        irresponsible—except in Angola. And politically, if it is <persName

                        and will get at the Panama Canal. I thought I would say that in ’64 there
                        were riots and people were killed and we are working to avoid that and
                        protect our interests. Hit <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> on

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I would say it is not
                        just an issue between us and Panama. You have an obligation to explore
                        whether we can reach an agreement which will preserve our interests over the
                        expected useful life of the Canal and preserve our relationships with Panama
                        and with Latin America. We don’t want to return to the climate of ’64 and
                            de<pb n="407" facs="0438" xml:id="pg_407"/>stroy our Latin American
                        relationships. It may not be possible to arrive at such an agreement but it
                        would be irresponsible not to try. You can’t sacrifice our interests in the
                        open use and defense of the Canal and any agreement must be submitted to the
                        Congress.</p>

                    <p>President: Okay. I just have to get myself off the hook of using the word
                        “never” and I also want to demonstrate that <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"

                    </p>
                    <p>It’s a very great honor and a tremendous privilege for me to meet with you
                        again in this historic hall. In this Bicentennial Year we have a very
                        special reason for rededication of the ideals and to the principles that
                        motivated American patriots in 1776.</p>
                    <p>I am very proud that my mother was a very active and dedicated member of the
                        Sophie de Marsac Campau Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.
                        The principles of loyalty and love of this country which she cultivated in
                        her children are just as important today as they were throughout her
                        lifetime. And they will continue to be important throughout our third
                        century of freedom in America.</p>
                    <p>The patriots of 1776—men like George Washington and Patrick Henry—did not
                        mince words nor will I, 200 years later, in reporting to you on a matter of
                        growing national concern.</p>
                    <p>Over the past several weeks, as the 1976 political campaigns have begun to
                        heat up, more and more attention has focused on the issue of America’s
                        military strength. Frankly, I presume this has happened because a grab bag
                        of other issues have tried and failed. However, this should not be a
                        partisan discussion. On national defense matters, some <pb n="408"
                            facs="0439" xml:id="pg_408"/>of my supporters are Democrats and some of
                        my critics are Republicans. Nevertheless, politics does have a way of
                        confusing the extremely complex issues of national security. This is
                        particularly evident every 4 years when we have a Presidential election
                        campaign.</p>
                    <p>I welcome the emergence of this debate because during the next 4 years many
                        crucial decisions must be made about our Armed Forces, decisions that will
                        affect our freedoms until the end of this century and beyond. Nothing is
                        more vital to our individual, personal security than the security of our
                        Nation.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the gravity of this subject demands that it be addressed
                        honestly, factually, and fairly. Unfortunately, too much of the debate so
                        far has been cast in exaggerated rhetoric that tends to mislead and confuse,
                        not to enlighten and to clarify.</p>
                    <p>I believe the American people, as well as our friends and adversaries abroad,
                        have too much common sense to fall for oversimplifications, but as your
                        President and as Commander in Chief, I do have a responsibility to set the
                        record straight. And, obviously, it is time for a little straight talk—and I
                        will give it to you this morning.</p>
                    <p>Recent charges that the United States is in a position of military
                        inferiority, that we have accepted Soviet world domination are complete and
                        utter nonsense. If there is any single standard which has guided my years in
                        public service it has been this: The freedom and security of the United
                        States of America must always be preserved. America is the greatest nation
                        on Earth and we will keep it that way.</p>
                    <p>I know the <gloss target="#t_DAR_1">DAR</gloss>’s record on national defense
                        and you know mine. They are virtually identical. My knowledge, my concern,
                        my record in support of a strong national defense does not go back merely a
                        few days, a few weeks, or even a few months, but all the way back to 1949
                        when I first went to the Congress. For 25 years in the Congress I stood for,
                        I spoke for, and I voted for a strong national defense.</p>
                    <p>For 14 years I served on the House Committee on Appropriations that each year
                        examined in great detail every one of the programs and then provided the
                        appropriations for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines. And
                        always, in those years, my stance was on the side of strength for
                        America.</p>
                    <p>During the years before I became Vice President, as minority leader of the
                        House of Representatives, I fought openly and hard year after year for the
                        maximum military strength recommended, whether by a Republican President or
                        by a Democratic President. For these last 2 years as your President, I have
                        called upon the Congress to approve the two biggest defense budgets in our
                        American history.</p>
                    <p>And my pledge to you today is this, that as long as I hold this office I
                        intend to see to it that the United States will never become second to
                        anybody, period.</p>
                    <pb n="409" facs="0440" xml:id="pg_409"/>
                    <p>Let’s look at the record more closely for just a few moments. When I became
                        President in August of 1974, some 20 months ago, I reaffirmed my conviction
                        that our military power must be strong enough to carry out three essential
                        objectives, and I found that we successfully met all three. We were and we
                        remain today ready and able to protect our own vital security interests. We
                        were and we remain today ready and able to deter aggression against our
                        allies. And we were and we remain today ready and able to keep the
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>Yet, as I was sworn into office, it was also apparent that we could not
                        afford complacency about our Armed Forces. Quite the contrary. For the past
                        10 to 15 years the Soviet Union has been striving with dogged determination
                        to overtake us in military strength. In our own country, on the other hand,
                        many people, especially in the United States Congress, seemed oblivious to
                        the growing Soviet military capability. Instead, Congress seemed to believe
                        that we could channel more and more of our tax dollars into rapidly growing
                        social programs and that our military should receive a smaller and smaller
                        share of our national financial resources.</p>
                    <p>In the 10-year period from 1964 to 1974, estimated in real dollar terms, the
                        Soviets expanded their defense spending by fully one-third. By stark
                        contrast, military requests of successive Presidents were slashed by $50
                        billion in the Congress during this same period. When I became President,
                        defense spending represented the lowest share of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1"
                            >GNP</gloss> since 1947.</p>
                    <p>There was cause to be concerned about the future security of the country,
                        particularly if the Congress continued to hack away at our military budgets.
                        If the Soviet Union continued to expand its capabilities and we continued to
                        bleed our own defense forces, it was inevitable that the United States would
                        eventually become a second-rate power. Clearly the adverse trend had to be
                        reversed, and I set out to make that one of the foremost objectives of my
                        administration.</p>
                    <p>In January of 1975, 5 months after I came into office, I submitted my first
                        budget to the Congress calling for a 10-percent increase in overall defense
                            spending.<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> submitted the budget to
                            Congress on February 3; see <ref target="#d55fn20">footnote 20, Document
                                55</ref>.</note> However, that year the Congress cut my defense
                        budget request by $6,500 million which included reductions of more than
                        $1,500 million in operation and maintenance for our forces, more than $3
                        billion in procurement of weapons and other equipment, and more than $700
                        million in research and development. Specifically, the Congress refused to
                        provide the full funding I requested for new naval ships, took away funds
                        for two of our new airborne warning and control systems aircraft designed to
                        vastly improve our surveillance, <pb n="410" facs="0441" xml:id="pg_410"
                        />warning, and control capabilities, denied us additional attack aircraft,
                        reduced the funds for modifying civil reserve air fleet aircraft, delaying
                        our backup airlift capability for support in military contingencies, cut our
                        intelligence and communications programs, reduced the program for our new
                            <gloss target="#t_B1_1">B–1</gloss> strategic bomber, cut into the Air
                        Force program for development of a new air combat fighter to maintain our
                        air superiority in the future, reduced our ballistic missile defense
                        technology program, reduced the fund request for war reserve stocks and
                        spare parts needed to sustain our fighting men in combat. I could go on and
                        on but the point is clear: No President could countenance such disregard for
                        the Nation’s security needs.</p>
                    <p>So in January of this year, 1976—only 3 months ago—I submitted an even bigger
                        defense budget: $112,700 million, or a 14 percent bigger budget than the
                        defense budget of the year before. I also made it very clear that if the
                        Congress sent me a defense bill that shortchanged the needs of this country,
                        I would take the unprecedented step of vetoing it because congressional
                        action was inadequate. Furthermore, I have gone to the American people on
                        this issue. To my satisfaction, it seems the American people share my
                        concern and are communicating that message to the Congress, and their
                        message was loud and clear—stop cheating the country’s defenses.</p>
                    <p>Two weeks ago the Congress took the first steps toward committing us to the
                        biggest single increase in defense spending since the Korean War. I thank
                        you and millions of other Americans for your help in this very crucial
                        matter. I hope you and literally millions of other Americans will keep the
                        pressure on the Congress. The defense program that I am advancing will mean
                        that the United States of America will remain unsurpassed for years and
                        years to come.</p>
                    <p>Just about 2 weeks ago, we laid the keel for the first of a new class of
                        nuclear submarines to be armed with the most accurate submarine ballistic
                        missiles in the world. The Trident missile fleet will be the foundation for
                        a formidable, technologically superior force through the 1980’s. We are now
                        completing the final testing of the world’s most modern and capable
                        strategic bomber, the <gloss target="#t_B1_1">B–1</gloss>. We are are also
                        accelerating work on a new intercontinental ballistic missile for the
                        1980’s. We are developing a new cruise missile for our air and naval
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>Nor does our effort stop with weapons, for we are also expanding our Army
                        from 13 to 16 combat divisions.</p>
                    <p>We are seeking to achieve new efficiencies across the board—better ways to
                        carry out our military missions that will not only save taxpayers $2,800
                        million for the next fiscal year but will also improve our readiness
                        capability of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines.</p>
                    <pb n="411" facs="0442" xml:id="pg_411"/>
                    <p>This is a program designed to ensure that America will never become number
                        two in military power. It is a sound investment in our future, and I intend
                        to see it through—this year, next year, right through to the end of this
                        decade.</p>
                    <p>I have spoken of our military strength. Let us never forget that our strength
                        will be meaningful only if it is matched by our resolve—our resolve to keep
                        the peace, our resolve to preserve our precious freedom.</p>
                    <p>No one should mistake our internal debates as a weakening of our intention to
                        protect our interests and to live up to our obligations to our friends. The
                        United States will not only remain secure in its power but I assure you we
                        shall not hesitate to use that power when it must be used in our national
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>Even as we are determined in our defense, we shall also be determined in our
                        efforts to reduce the potential of a nuclear holocaust. We are continuing
                        the strategic arms limitation talks with the Soviet Union for the simple but
                        very good reason that these negotiations offer the best hope for sanity in
                        superpower relations. Ever since the beginning of serious arms negotiations
                        with the Russians years and years ago, there have been political pressures
                        either to speed up or to slow down the negotiations, and those pressures
                        continue today. Instead, I have chosen a steady but persistent course based
                        on a realistic appreciation of our national interests. Those interests do
                        not lie in an uncontrolled nuclear arms race, but in maintaining an
                        equitable strategic balance at the lowest possible level.</p>
                    <p>Those who argue that <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks jeopardize
                        the security of the United States are badly mistaken. In Vladivostok, we
                        began negotiating an agreement which, if successfully completed, will place
                        equal ceilings on missiles, heavy bombers, and multi-headed warheads.</p>
                    <p>There are still many important issues to be resolved in the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks. I do not know at this time
                        whether we will succeed, but under no circumstances will we be stampeded by
                        arbitrary deadlines or demagogic political charges. We will be guided solely
                        by the national interests of the United States of America. If a sound
                        agreement is reached, of course, I will submit it to the United States
                        Senate for ratification.</p>
                    <p>My friends, this election year is still young. There is still time to restore
                        reason and perspective to our debates over national security. Those who seek
                        our Nation’s highest office have an obligation, I believe, to spell out the
                        alternative directions they proposed in our foreign policy and our defense
                        policy. It is not good enough to criticize current policies while refusing
                        to propose specific alternatives. Those who seek the Presidency must be
                        equal to its burdens.</p>
                    <p>To charge that this administration—an administration that has fought for the
                        two biggest defense budgets in history and for the first <pb n="412"
                            facs="0443" xml:id="pg_412"/>time in 10 years is convincing the United
                        States Congress to spend enough for defense—to charge that we have led our
                        Nation into military inferiority is preposterous on its face.</p>
                    <p>The American people have had enough distorted allegations that we have become
                        a second-rate power. We must see the world as it is. We must form our
                        policies out of hard facts, not political fiction.</p>
                    <p>First and foremost is the fact that the United States today is the single
                        most powerful nation on Earth—indeed, in all history—and we are going to
                        keep it that way. Our economic power is far and away the largest and the
                        most productive, producing an estimated 24 percent of the world’s wealth
                        with less than 6 percent of the world’s population. At a time when the
                        number of democracies in the world has dwindled to less than two dozen out
                        of over 140 countries on this globe, we remain the best hope of freedom and
                        the inspiration for liberty of all mankind.</p>
                    <p>I say that those with faith in America must speak the truth to the American
                        people—the truth that we are the greatest nation on Earth; the truth that we
                        have the strength to defend our interest and to resolve to uphold our
                        values; the truth that we are strong, we can never relax our guard; the
                        truth that for the first time since the days of <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1"
                            >Dwight Eisenhower</persName>, a President standing for election can say
                        we are at peace; and, finally, the truth that we must actively engage in
                        maintaining world peace and defending freedom.</p>
                    <p>I promise to you that I will do everything within the power of the Presidency
                        to keep America strong—militarily, economically, and morally—as I have
                        throughout my public life, but I need your help. Without your support,
                        without the informed, intelligent, confident, constructive support of all
                        the American people, no President can keep the ship of state on a safe,
                        steady course. But with your help, our 200th birthday as a nation can be
                        truly a rebirth of America.</p>
                    <p>For 200 years, we have more than justified the faith and far exceeded the
                        wildest dreams of our Founding Fathers. Time and time again, we have
                        repeated the hardships of Valley Forge and the sacrifices of Iwo Jima to
                        protect and to defend our precious freedom. Our dedicated Armed Forces stand
                        guard today in the same spirit.</p>
                    <p>America today is unsurpassed in military capability. We have the greatest
                        industrial capacity in the history of mankind. Our farmers outproduce
                        everyone in history. We are ahead in education, science, and technology. We
                        have the greatest moral and spiritual resources of any modern nation.</p>
                    <p>Let us resolve today to build upon those great strengths, so that 100 years
                        from now our great grandchildren can look back and say they, too, are proud
                        of America and proud to be Americans.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much.</p>

                            United States squarely behind majority rule in Southern Africa.”

                        a message of commitment and cooperation.</p>
                    <p>I have come to Africa because in so many ways the challenges of Africa are
                        the challenges of the modern era. Morally and politically, the drama of
                        national independence in Africa over the last generation has transformed
                        international affairs. More than any other region of the world, Africa
                        symbolizes that the previous era of world affairs, the colonial era, is a
                        thing of the past. The great tasks you face—in nationbuilding, in keeping
                        the peace and integrity of this continent, in economic development, in
                        gaining an equitable role in world councils, in achieving racial
                        justice—these reflect the challenges of building a humane and progressive
                        world order.</p>
                    <p>I have come to Africa with an open mind and an open heart to demonstrate my
                        country’s desire to work with you on these great tasks. My journey is
                        intended to give fresh impetus to our cooperation and to usher in a new era

                            of U.S. policy toward Southern Africa. The study was to develop policy
                            options based on a definition of U.S. interests in Southern Africa, the
                            examination of majority rule and the likelihood of foreign involvement
                            in Rhodesia, a description of scenarios for a settlement of the problem

                    <p>The United States was one of the prime movers of the process of
                        decolonization. The American people welcomed the new nations into the world
                        community and for two decades have given aid and encouragement to economic
                        and social progress in Africa. And America’s responsibilities as a global
                        power give us a strong interest today in the independence, peace, and
                        well-being of this vast continent comprising a fifth of the world’s land
                        surface. For without peace, racial justice, and <pb n="414" facs="0445"
                            xml:id="pg_414"/>growing prosperity in Africa, we cannot speak of a just
                        international order.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing to be gained in a debate about whether in the past America
                        has neglected Africa or been insufficiently committed to African goals. The
                        United States has many responsibilities in the world. Given the burden it
                        has carried in the postwar period, it could not do everything
                        simultaneously. African nations, too, have their own priorities and
                        concerns, which have not always accorded with our own. No good can come of
                        mutual recrimination. Our differing perspectives converge in a common
                        purpose to build a secure and just future for Africa. In active
                        collaboration there is much we can do; in contention or apart we will miss
                        great opportunities. President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>
                        and the American Government and people are prepared to work with you with
                        energy and good will if met in the same spirit.</p>
                    <p>So it is time to put aside slogans and to seek practical solutions. It is
                        time to find our common ground and act boldly for common ends.</p>
                    <p>Africa is a continent of hope, a modern frontier. The United States from the
                        beginning has been a country of the frontier, built by men and women of
                        hope. The American people know from their history the meaning of the
                        struggle for independence, for racial equality, for economic progress, for
                        human dignity.</p>
                    <p>I am not here to give American prescriptions for Africa’s problems. Your
                        program must be African. The basic decisions and goals must be African. But
                        we are prepared to help.</p>
                    <p>Nor am I here to set African against African, either among your governments
                        or among factions of liberation movements. African problems cannot be
                        solved, and your destiny cannot be fulfilled, except by a united Africa.</p>
                    <p>America supports African unity. We urge all other countries to do the
                        same.</p>
                    <p>Here in Africa the range of mankind’s challenges and potential can be seen in
                        all its complexity and enormous promise.</p>
                    <p>The massive power and grandeur of nature is before us in all its aspects—as
                        the harsh master and as a bountiful servant of mankind.</p>
                    <p>Here we can feel the rich and living cultures which have changed and
                        invigorated art, music, and thought around the world.</p>
                    <p>And here on this continent we are tested, all of us, to see whether our
                        future will be determined for us or by us, whether humanity will be the
                        victim or the architect of its destiny.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Issues of Southern Africa</p>
                    <p>Of all the challenges before us, of all the purposes we have in common,
                        racial justice is one of the most basic. This is a dominant issue of our
                        age, within nations and among nations.</p>
                    <pb n="415" facs="0446" xml:id="pg_415"/>
                    <p>We know from our own experience that the goal of racial justice is both
                        compelling and achievable. Our support for this principle in southern Africa
                        is not simply a matter of foreign policy but an imperative of our own moral
                        heritage.</p>
                    <p>The people of Zambia do not need to be reminded of the importance of
                        realizing this goal. By geography and economic necessity, Zambia is affected
                        directly and grievously by strife in southern Africa. Political stability in
                        this region means more to Zambia than to many others. Yet Zambia has chosen
                        to stand by her principles by closing her border with Rhodesia and enduring
                        the economic consequences. This is a testimony to the determination of the
                        people of this country and to the statesmanship of its great leader,
                        President Kaunda.</p>
                    <p>And it was in this city seven years ago that leaders of east and central
                        African states proclaimed their Manifesto on Southern Africa.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d77fn3">The Manifesto on Southern Africa was issued on April 16,
                            1969, at the conclusion of the Summit Conference of East and Central
                            African States held in Lusaka. A summary of the Lusaka Manifesto,
                            declaring the right of “all men to participate as equal members of the
                            society in their own government” and condemning South Africa’s apartheid

                    </p>
                    <p>One is struck by the similarity of philosophy in the American Declaration of
                        Independence and in the Lusaka Manifesto. Two hundred years ago Thomas
                        Jefferson wrote:</p>
                    <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that
                        they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that
                        among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure
                        these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just
                        powers from the consent of the governed.</p>
                    <p>And seven years ago the leaders of east and central Africa declared here in
                        Lusaka that:</p>
                    <p>By this Manifesto we wish to make clear, beyond all shadow of doubt, our
                        acceptance of the belief that all men are equal, and have equal rights to
                        human dignity and respect, regardless of colour, race, religion or sex. We
                        believe that all men have the right and the duty to participate, as equal
                        members of the society, in their own Government.</p>
                    <p>There can be no doubt that the United States remains committed to the
                        principles of its own Declaration of Independence. It follows that we also
                        adhere to the convictions of the Lusaka Manifesto.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, here in Lusaka, I reaffirm the unequivocal commitment of the
                        United States to human rights, as expressed in the principles of the U.N.
                        Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We support
                        self-determination, majority rule, equal rights, and human dignity for all
                        the peoples of southern Africa—in the name of moral principle, international
                        law, and world peace.</p>
                    <pb n="416" facs="0447" xml:id="pg_416"/>
                    <p>On this occasion I would like to set forth more fully American policy on some
                        of the immediate issues we face—in Rhodesia, Namibia, and South Africa—and
                        then to sketch our vision of southern Africa’s hopeful future.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The U.S. Position on Rhodesia</p>
                    <p>The U.S. position on Rhodesia is clear and unmistakable. As President
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> has said, “The United
                        States is totally dedicated to seeing to it that the majority becomes the
                        ruling power in Rhodesia.” We do not recognize the Rhodesian minority
                        regime. The United States voted for, and is committed to, the U.N. Security
                        Council resolutions of 1966 and 1968 that imposed mandatory economic
                        sanctions against the illegal Rhodesian regime.<note n="4" xml:id="d77fn4"
                            >Adopted on December 16, 1966, U.N. Security Council Resolution 232
                            (1966) imposed a series of economic sanctions on Rhodesia, including an
                            embargo on the supply of oil and oil products. The text of the
                            resolution is printed in <hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the United

                            253 (1968), adopted May 29, 1968, extended existing sanctions against
                            Rhodesian imports and exports to cover all commodities except medical,
                            educational, and humanitarian supplies and tightened restrictions on
                            both travel to Rhodesia and travel by Rhodesian passport holders. The

                        joined others to commend Mozambique for its decision to enforce these
                        sanctions even at great economic cost to itself.</p>
                    <p>It is the responsibility of all who seek a negotiated solution to make clear
                        to the Rhodesian minority that the world community is united in its
                        insistence on rapid change. It is the responsibility of those in Rhodesia
                        who believe in peace to take the steps necessary to avert a great
                        tragedy.</p>
                    <p>U.S. policy for a just and durable Rhodesian solution will therefore rest on
                        10 elements:</p>
                    <p>—First, the United States declares its support in the strongest terms for the
                        proposals made by British Prime Minister Callaghan, then Foreign Secretary,
                        on March 22 of this year: that independence must be preceded by majority
                        rule, which in turn must be achieved no later than two years following the
                        expeditious conclusion of negotiations. We consider these proposals a basis
                        for a settlement fair to all the people of Rhodesia. We urge that they be
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p>—Second, the Salisbury regime must understand that it cannot expect U.S.
                        support either in diplomacy or in material help at any stage in its conflict
                        with African states or African liberation movements. On the <pb n="417"
                            facs="0448" xml:id="pg_417"/>contrary, it will face our unrelenting
                        opposition until a negotiated settlement is achieved.</p>
                    <p>—Third, the United States will take steps to fulfill completely its
                        obligation under international law to mandatory economic sanctions against
                        Rhodesia. We will urge the Congress this year to repeal the <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHFJ_1">Byrd</persName> amendment,<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d77fn6">See <ref target="#d49fn9">footnote 9, Document
                            49</ref>.</note> which authorizes Rhodesian chrome imports to the United
                        States, an act inconsistent with U.N. sanctions. In parallel with this
                        effort, we will approach other industrial nations to insure the strictest
                        and broadest international compliance with sanctions.</p>
                    <p>—Fourth, to insure that there are no misperceptions on the part of the
                        leaders of the minority in Rhodesia, the United States, on the conclusion of
                        my consultations in black Africa, will communicate clearly and directly to
                        the Salisbury regime our view of the urgency of a rapid negotiated
                        settlement leading to majority rule.</p>
                    <p>—Fifth, the U.S. Government will carry out its responsibility to inform
                        American citizens that we have no official representation in Rhodesia nor
                        any means of providing them with assistance or protection. American
                        travelers will be advised against entering Rhodesia; Americans resident
                        there will be urged to leave.</p>
                    <p>—Sixth, as in the case of Zambia a few years ago, steps should be taken—in
                        accordance with the recent U.N. Security Council resolution—to assist
                        Mozambique, whose closing of its borders with Rhodesia to enforce sanctions
                        has imposed upon it a great additional economic hardship. In accordance with
                        this U.N. resolution, the United States is willing to provide $12.5 million
                        of assistance.</p>
                    <p>—Seventh, the United States, together with other members of the United
                        Nations, is ready to help alleviate economic hardship for any countries
                        neighboring Rhodesia which decide to enforce sanctions by closing their
                        frontiers.</p>
                    <p>—Eighth, humanitarian provision must be made for the thousands of refugees
                        who have fled in distress from Rhodesia into neighboring countries. The
                        United States will consider sympathetically requests for assistance for
                        these refugees by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees or other
                        appropriate international organizations.</p>
                    <p>—Ninth, the world community should give its support to the people of Rhodesia
                        as they make the peaceful transition to majority rule and independence and
                        should aid a newly independent Zimbabwe. To this end, we are ready to join
                        with other interested nations in a program of economic, technical, and
                        educational assistance to enable an independent Zimbabwe to achieve the
                        progress and the place in the <pb n="418" facs="0449" xml:id="pg_418"
                        />community of nations to which its resources and the talents of all its
                        people entitle it.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, we state our conviction that whites as well as blacks should have a
                        secure future and civil rights in a Zimbabwe that has achieved racial
                        justice. A constitutional structure should protect minority rights together
                        with establishing majority rule. We are prepared to devote some of our
                        assistance programs to this objective.</p>
                    <p>In carrying out this program we shall consult closely with the Presidents of
                        Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia.</p>
                    <p>We believe these are important measures. We are openminded with respect to
                        additional actions that can help speed a resolution. The United States will
                        consult closely with African leaders, especially the four Presidents, and
                        with other friends on the Rhodesian problem. For the central fact that I
                        have come here to stress is this: The United States is wholly committed to
                        help bring about a rapid, just, and African solution to the issue of
                        Rhodesia.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Namibia</p>
                    <p>Rhodesia is the most urgent but by no means the only critical problem in
                        southern Africa. The status of Namibia has been a source of contention
                        between the world community and South Africa for over three decades.</p>
                    <p>The Territory of South West Africa turned into a source of serious
                        international discord following World War II. When the United Nations
                        refused to accede to South Africa’s proposal for annexation of the
                        territory, South Africa declined to enter into a trusteeship agreement and
                        since then has refused to recognize the United Nations as the legal
                        sovereign. In 1966 the General Assembly terminated South Africa’s mandate
                        over the territory.<note n="7" xml:id="d77fn7">U.N. General Assembly
                            Resolution 2145 (XXI) was adopted October 27, 1966. The text of the

                    <p>The United States voted for the 1966 General Assembly resolution. We were the
                        only major power to argue before the International Court that South African
                        occupation was illegal. And in January 1976 the United States voted in favor
                        of the U.N. resolution condemning the occupation of Namibia and calling for
                        South Africa to take specific steps toward Namibia’s self-determination and

                    </p>
                    <p>We are encouraged by the South African Government’s evident decision to move
                        Namibia toward independence. We are convinced <pb n="419" facs="0450"
                            xml:id="pg_419"/>that a solution can be found which will embody equal
                        rights for the entire population and at the same time protect the interests
                        of all who live and work there. But we are concerned that South Africa has
                        failed to announce a definite timetable for the achievement of
                        self-determination, that all the people and all political groupings of
                        Namibia have not been allowed to take part in determining the form of
                        government they shall one day have, and that South Africa continues to deny
                        the United Nations its proper role in establishing a free and independent
                        Namibia.</p>
                    <p>Therefore the U.S. position is as follows:</p>
                    <p>—We reiterate our call upon the South African Government to permit all the
                        people and groups of Namibia to express their views freely, under U.N.
                        supervision, on the political future and constitutional structure of their
                        country.</p>
                    <p>—We urge the South African Government to announce a definite timetable,
                        acceptable to the world community, for the achievement of
                        self-determination.</p>
                    <p>—The United States is prepared to work with the international community, and
                        especially with African leaders, to determine what further steps would
                        improve prospects for a rapid and acceptable transition to Namibian
                        independence. We are convinced that the need for progress is urgent.</p>
                    <p>—Once concrete movement toward self-determination is underway, the United
                        States will ease its restrictions on trade and investment in Namibia. We
                        stand ready to provide economic and technical assistance to help Namibia
                        take its rightful place among the independent nations of the world.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">South Africa</p>
                    <p>Apartheid in South Africa remains an issue of great concern to those
                        committed to racial justice and human dignity.</p>
                    <p>No country, no people, can claim perfection in the realm of human rights. We
                        in America are aware of our own imperfections. But because we are a free
                        society, our problems and our shortcomings are fully aired and made known to
                        the world. And we have reason to take pride in our progress in the quest for
                        justice for all in our country.</p>
                    <p>The world community’s concern with South Africa is not merely that racial
                        discrimination exists there. What is unique is the extent to which racial
                        discrimination has been institutionalized, enshrined in law, and made
                        all-pervasive.</p>
                    <p>No one, including the leaders of black Africa, challenges the right of white
                        South Africans to live in their country. They are not colonialists;
                        historically, they are an African people. But white South Africans must
                        recognize as well that the world will continue to insist that the in<pb
                            n="420" facs="0451" xml:id="pg_420"/>stitutionalized separation of the
                        races must end. The United States appeals to South Africa to heed the
                        warning signals of the past two years. There is still time to bring about a
                        reconciliation of South Africa’s peoples for the benefit of all. But there
                        is a limit to that time—a limit of far shorter duration than was generally
                        perceived even a few years ago.</p>
                    <p>A peaceful end to institutionalized inequality is in the interest of all
                        South Africans. The United States will continue to encourage and work for
                        peaceful change. Our policy toward South Africa is based upon the premise
                        that within a reasonable time we shall see a clear evolution toward equality
                        of opportunity and basic human rights for all South Africans. The United
                        States will exercise all its efforts in that direction. We urge the
                        Government of South Africa to make that premise a reality.</p>
                    <p>In the immediate future, the Republic of South Africa can show its dedication
                        to Africa—and its potential contribution to Africa—by using its influence in
                        Salisbury to promote a rapid negotiated settlement for majority rule in
                        Rhodesia. This, we are sure, would be viewed positively by the community of
                        nations as well as by the rest of Africa.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Vision of the Future</p>
                    <p>Southern Africa has all the prerequisites for an exciting future. Richly
                        endowed with minerals, agricultural and hydroelectric potential, a favorable
                        climate, and most important, great human resources, it needs only to
                        overcome the human failure of racial strife to achieve bright prospects for
                        all its peoples. Let us all strive to speed the day when this vision becomes
                        a reality.</p>
                    <p>The United States stands ready to work with the nations of southern Africa to
                        help them achieve the economic progress which will give meaning to their
                        political independence and dignity to their struggle for equality.</p>
                    <p>As you know, Deputy Secretary Robinson, an expert in economic development, is
                        accompanying me on this visit. This is the first time that an American
                        Secretary of State and Deputy Secretary together have come on such a
                        mission, reflecting the importance we attach to the economic development of
                        southern Africa. Mr. Robinson and I are discussing development needs with
                        African officials in the various capitals, and we shall continue these
                        consultations at the <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss> [U.N.
                        Conference on Trade and Development] meeting in Nairobi next week. After my
                        return to Washington, based on what we have learned, we will urgently study
                        a new aid program for this continent.</p>
                    <p>Africa and its friends face a dual challenge: immediate and long-term growth.
                        In the short term, economic emergencies can arise from natural disasters or
                        sharp swings in global economic conditions over which developing nations
                        have little control. These economic <pb n="421" facs="0452" xml:id="pg_421"
                        />shocks must be dealt with if the nations of the region are to maintain
                        their hard-won progress toward development. For example, the sharp drop in
                        world copper prices has had a devastating impact on the economies of Zambia
                        and Zaïre. The United States will deal with this problem in its bilateral
                        assistance programs for these countries and in our programs for multilateral
                        action—to be proposed at <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss> next
                        week—for resource development, buffer stocks, and earnings
                        stabilization.</p>
                    <p>But our basic concern must go beyond responding to emergencies. We need to
                        develop urgently programs to lay the foundations for sustained growth to
                        enable the developing nations of southern Africa to deal effectively with
                        global economic shocks and trends.</p>
                    <p>Let me mention four that are especially relevant to southern Africa: trained
                        local manpower, rural development, advanced technology, and modern
                        transportation.</p>
                    <p>—For Namibia and Zimbabwe, training programs should be intensified now so
                        that needed manpower will be ready when majority rule is attained. Existing
                        programs to train Namibian and Zimbabwean refugees as administrators and
                        technicians should be expanded as rapidly as possible. We have requested
                        additional funds from Congress for this purpose. We urge other donors and
                        international organizations to do more.</p>
                    <p>—Development for all of southern Africa involves a process of transforming
                        rural life. We are prepared to assist in agricultural development, in health
                        programs, in manpower training, in improving rural transportation, through
                        both bilateral and multilateral programs.</p>
                    <p>—A revolution in development planning could be achieved by the use of
                        satellites to collect vital information on crops, weather, water resources,
                        land use, and mineral exploration. The United States has already shared with
                        developing nations information from our earliest earth resources survey
                        satellites. We are now prepared to undertake much larger programs to apply
                        this technology to Africa, including training programs and the development
                        of training facilities and satellite-receiving stations in Africa
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>—Perhaps the most critical long-term economic need of southern Africa is a
                        modern system of regional transportation. The magnitude of the effort
                        extends beyond the capacity of any one nation or group of nations. For this
                        reason the United States proposes that the World Bank undertake as a
                        priority matter the organization of a multilateral consultative group of
                        donors to develop a modern regional transportation system for southern
                        Africa. For our part we promise our full cooperation in working out a
                        long-term program and in financing appropriate portions of it.</p>
                    <pb n="422" facs="0453" xml:id="pg_422"/>
                    <p>And finally, I can announce today that we expect to triple our support for
                        development programs in southern and central Africa over the next three
                        years.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the United States has offered leadership in many international
                        forums to promote development through multilateral cooperation. The
                        industrial nations, the newly wealthy oil producers, and the developing
                        countries themselves must collaborate for the goal of development. Africa is
                        a principal beneficiary of the many U.S. initiatives in multilateral
                        institutions and programs—to enhance economic security through supporting
                        export earnings in the face of sharp economic swings, to promote growth
                        through better access to capital markets and technology transfers, to
                        accelerate agricultural production, to improve the conditions of trade and
                        investment in key commodities, and to address the special needs of the
                        poorest nations.</p>
                    <p>Many of the proposals we have made are already being implemented. Next week
                        in Nairobi, I will put forward new proposals to further advance progress in
                        relations between developed and developing nations.</p>
                    <p>Today I have outlined the principles of American policy on the compelling
                        challenges of southern Africa.</p>
                    <p>Our proposals are not a program made in America to be passively accepted by
                        Africans. They are an expression of common aspirations and an agenda of
                        cooperation. Underlying the proposals is our fundamental conviction that
                        Africa’s destiny must remain in African hands.</p>
                    <p>No one who wishes this continent well can want to see Africans divided either
                        between nations or between liberation movements. Africans cannot want
                        outsiders seeking to impose solutions or choosing among countries or
                        movements. The United States, for its part, does not seek any pro-American
                        African bloc confronting a bloc supporting any other power. Nor do we wish
                        to support one faction of a liberation movement against another. But neither
                        should any other country pursue hegemonial aspirations or bloc policies. An
                        attempt by one will inevitably be countered by the other. The United States
                        therefore supports African unity and integrity categorically as basic
                        principles of our policy.</p>
                    <p>There is no better guarantee against outside pressure from any quarter than
                        the determination of African nations in defense of their own independence
                        and unity. You did not build African institutions to see outside forces
                        fragment them into competing blocs. The United States supports Africa’s
                        genuine nonalignment and unity. We are ready for collaboration on the basis
                        of mutual respect. We do so guided by our convictions and our values. Your
                        cause is too compatible with our principles for you to need to pursue it by
                        tactics of confrontation <pb n="423" facs="0454" xml:id="pg_423"/>with the
                        United States; our self-respect is too strong to let ourselves be pressured
                        either directly or by outside powers.</p>
                    <p>What Africa needs now from the United States is not exuberant promises or
                        emotional expressions of good will. What it needs is a concrete program,
                        which I have sought to offer today. So let us get down to business. Let us
                        direct our eyes toward our great goals—national independence, economic
                        development, racial justice, goals that can be achieved by common
                        action.</p>
                    <p>Africa in this decade is a testing ground of the world’s conscience and
                        vision. That blacks and whites live together in harmony and equality is a
                        moral imperative of our time. Let us prove that these goals can be realized
                        by human choice, that justice can command by the force of its rightness
                        instead of by force of arms.</p>
                    <p>These are ideals that bind all the races of mankind. They are the mandate of
                        decency and progress and peace.</p>
                    <p>This drama will be played out in our own lifetime. Our children will inherit
                        either our success or our failure. The world watches with hope, and we
                        approach it with confidence.</p>
                    <p>So let it be said that black people and white people working together
                        achieved on this continent, which has suffered so much and seen so much
                        injustice, a new era of peace, well-being, and human dignity.<note n="9"

                            prosperity, and human dignity.” His trip, he argued, “laid a sound
                            foundation” for “bringing about moderate, negotiated solutions to the
                            urgent political problems of southern Africa; the long-term economic
                            development of the continent; and strengthening our ties with Africa in
                            the service of interests we share—peace, independence, prosperity,
                            respect for human dignity, and justice.” (Department of State <hi

                    <p rend="center">American Resolve and the Security of Israel</p>
                    <p>I want to take a few moments this evening to recall some of our basic
                        objectives and opportunities in the world—the permanent interests and
                        concerns for which this nation is responsible—and why our commitment to the
                        security and survival of Israel is an essential element of our global
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>We have been committed for 30 years to the maintenance of global peace. No
                        other nation has the strength to do so without us. The United States for 30
                        years has been the engine of the world economy and the promoter of economic
                        development. No other nation has the resources or technology or managerial
                        skill to do so alone. Without our commitment there can be no security;
                        without our dedication there can be no progress.</p>
                    <p>This role is not an act of altruism, but a matter of vital self-interest.
                        Upheavals in key areas such as the Middle East menace our friends and
                        allies, jeopardize our prosperity, and raise the risk of global
                        confrontation. The Middle East war of 1973 brought a confrontation with the
                        Soviet Union and contributed to the most severe recession in the postwar
                        period.</p>
                    <p>But neither peace nor progress comes inevitably or automatically. These goals
                        are mere abstractions if they are not pursued with strength, vision, and
                        conviction. For a generation, America has been the leader in maintaining the
                        balance of power, in offering help to friends to insure their survival, in
                        mediating conflicts, in building and sustaining international cooperation
                        for economic progress. We could not have done so without our strength; we
                        would not have done so without our convictions.</p>
                    <p>Today we can be proud of where we stand.</p>
                    <p>After 35 years of continual tensions and intermittent conflict, America is
                        now at peace; no American is at war anywhere in the world. Militarily, our
                        power is vast and growing, superior in technology and in the most important
                        categories of strategic strength. We have solid and secure allies. Our
                        readiness and our resolve deter wars and buttress global stability.</p>
                    <pb n="425" facs="0456" xml:id="pg_425"/>
                    <p>Economically, the United States and the great industrialized democracies have
                        shown once again the resiliency and basic vigor of free economies. We have
                        successfully come through a period of recession and inflation induced in
                        large part by drastic and unwarranted oil price increases. The solidarity of
                        our major alliances has dramatically proved itself in a new sphere of common
                        endeavor—economic recovery and energy policy—adding another dimension of
                        unity above and beyond our collective defense.</p>
                    <p>Our Founding Fathers were men of faith and vision. They had faith in the
                        future of a free people. And they had the vision to understand, as Edmund
                        Burke said, that “You can never plan the future by the past.”</p>
                    <p>We need these qualities as much today as 200 years ago: Faith, because, to
                        our people, dedication to the cause of freedom transcends partisanship and
                        ethnic or social division; vision, because while we must learn from the
                        past, we are not, and must not become, its prisoner.</p>
                    <p>These qualities of faith and vision are characteristic also of another
                        people—the people of Israel. They are qualities we need especially as we
                        contemplate the future of the Middle East and seek to build there, together,
                        a lasting peace.</p>
                    <p>There is no greater example of the power of faith than the creation of the
                        State of Israel. For centuries it was a dream for the persecuted and
                        oppressed; then it became a reality. And a reality it shall remain. The
                        survivors never lost their faith, and they built a modern nation in the
                        desert in our own lifetime. Now they dream of peace. And that, too, they
                        will achieve.</p>
                    <p>The road ahead is almost certainly more difficult—but nonetheless
                        inescapable—than the steps we have taken so far. But we are launched
                        together on that road, and we shall continue together with confidence and
                        dedication.</p>
                    <p>For our relations with Israel are central to and inseparable from the broad
                        concept of our foreign policy. The United States has permanent and
                        fundamental concerns in the world that reflect the values of our people.
                        True to the origins of our own nation:</p>
                    <p>—We have always been inspired by moral aims, committed to use our power for
                        the cause of freedom, justice, and international security.</p>
                    <p>—We have maintained a strong defense and supported our friends, knowing that
                        we could not leave the future of freedom to the mercy of others.</p>
                    <p>—We have wielded our strength as a creative force for peace, promoting
                        solutions to conflicts and new endeavors of cooperation, confident that
                        mankind is not doomed to anarchy and destruction; that its power can be used
                        for conciliation and progress.</p>
                    <pb n="426" facs="0457" xml:id="pg_426"/>
                    <p>—And we have exerted our leadership as well in the economic realm, conscious
                        that the well-being of nations and peoples is a fundamental component of
                        international order and of a better future.</p>
                    <p>These principles will guide our policy as we seek peace in the Middle
                        East.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Morality and Foreign Policy</p>
                    <p>The genius of America has always been its moral significance. Since its birth
                        America has held a promise and a dream to which others have clung and many
                        have sought to emulate. As Gladstone said, “. . . the American Constitution
                        is the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and
                        purpose of man.”</p>
                    <p>Americans have always believed that what we did mattered not just for
                        ourselves but for all mankind. We have been the bulwark of democracy, a
                        refuge for those fleeing persecution, and the most humanitarian nation in
                        history.</p>
                    <p>Since the end of World War II global peace and prosperity have depended to an
                        extraordinary degree upon America. Throughout this period America’s might
                        has always been used to defend, never to oppress. So it will be in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The relationship between America and Israel rests fundamentally on this moral
                        basis. If the world is to be peaceful and equitable, the conduct of nations
                        must have an ethical foundation. Those who have suffered from its absence,
                        who have been victimized by arbitrary power—and no people has been more than
                        the Jewish people—know in their bones how without ethical principles the
                        ruthless will rule and the weak will suffer. Peace with justice must have a
                        special meaning for a people—like the Jewish people—who have, through
                        history, sought it so fervently but experienced it so rarely.</p>
                    <p>For all these reasons, Americans look upon Israel as a loyal friend
                        committed, as are we, to the principles of freedom and democracy. We value
                        the part we played in creating the State of Israel and in sustaining its
                        survival. The United States can never ignore its moral responsibility for
                        the fate of nations which rely upon us as the ultimate defender of their
                        survival and freedom. We are thoroughly convinced that Israel’s survival is
                        inseparable from the future of human dignity, and we shall never forget that
                        Israel’s security has a special claim on the conscience of mankind.</p>
                    <p>Nor will we forget that the true strength of friendship lies in our honesty
                        and candor with each other. Our relationship with Israel is too important
                        for us to delude ourselves with less than our honest opinions. We do not
                        prove our friendship by ignoring the realities we both face. We undermine
                        our common future if, for temporary expediency, we tell each other fairy
                        tales. We prove our good intentions by <pb n="427" facs="0458"
                            xml:id="pg_427"/>working together with dedication, facing hardship and
                        reality for the common good, and above all by never forgetting how important
                        our partnership is for all that we each seek in the world.</p>
                    <p>America’s aim is a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, and so is
                        Israel’s. During the U.N.’s consideration of the Palestine question over 25
                        years ago, an American diplomat expressed the hope that the day will come
                        when the Jews and Arabs in the Middle East will live together in the true
                        spirit of Christian brotherhood. We may be amused by the phrase, but it
                        reflects a basic aspiration. Israel is entitled to live with its neighbors
                        in the same sense of safety and normalcy that is taken for granted almost
                        everywhere else in the world.</p>
                    <p>The United States and Israel can debate over tactics, but never over the
                        basic reality that our relationship with each other is special for reasons
                        that transcend tactics. What ties us together is not legal documents, but a
                        moral connection which cannot be severed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Strong Defense</p>
                    <p>The second strand of American policy is a realistic appreciation of the
                        importance of American strength. Aspirations for a better world are empty
                        without the strength to implement them. No one should understand better than
                        the Jewish people that weakness is not a virtue and that righteousness alone
                        is no protection in a world of insecurity and injustice.</p>
                    <p>There can be no security without equilibrium and no safety without the
                        restraint which a balance of power imposes. Only when the rights of nations
                        are respected by necessity, when accommodation supplants force, can
                        mankind’s energies be devoted to the realization of its higher
                        aspirations.</p>
                    <p>For 30 years the United States has occupied a central place in the global
                        balance of stability. Our strength or our weakness, our effectiveness or
                        ineffectiveness, affect decisively the calculations of nearly every nation
                        in the world and determine our ability to shape events to our purposes. We
                        cannot surrender one strategic part of the world to those who oppose us and
                        remain secure and unchallenged in another. So those who want America strong
                        in one part of the world have a special obligation to keep it strong in all
                        strategically important areas. Nations, wherever they are located, that rely
                        on us cannot fail to be affected whenever America abdicates
                        responsibility—whether in Asia or in Africa.</p>
                    <p>The American people have never been comfortable with weakness. We have never
                        relished abdication. And when it is imposed on us by domestic divisions it
                        has its inevitable reaction. It is reassuring to see the American people
                        once again emphatically united on the necessity of a strong defense. This
                        year’s defense budget will allow us to con<pb n="428" facs="0459"
                            xml:id="pg_428"/>tinue to improve our military forces—to insure that no
                        other nation can threaten us, our interests, or our friends.</p>
                    <p>As President Kennedy wrote, we did not ask to be “the watchmen on the walls
                        of world freedom.”<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">For President Kennedy’s
                            address prepared for delivery at Dallas, Tex., on Nov. 22, 1963, see
                            “Public Papers of the Presidents, <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John F.

                            original.]</note> But circumstances have made us so. History taught us
                        that our own tranquillity depends on global stability. From Waterloo to
                        Sarajevo, America benefited from the stability of a world balance of power
                        which maintained global security and prevented international war. That
                        responsibility now rests, in large measure, with us. It is a responsibility
                        we cannot skirt.</p>
                    <p>The United States will keep its friends and allies strong enough to defend
                        themselves with our support—to insure that peace is seen clearly by their
                        adversaries to be the only feasible course.</p>
                    <p>We will not fail to provide for Israel’s security. American aid to Israel was
                        $437 million in fiscal year 1973; since then it has increased to 2.3
                        billions of dollars for the current fiscal year—a fivefold increase in three
                        years. Israel now receives about a third of our total foreign assistance.
                        Israel has received $6 billion in aid since its founding; we have proposed
                        $4.1 billion for the next two years. Those who opportunistically question
                        our dedication to the security of Israel should examine these
                        statistics.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Maintaining a Stable Peace</p>
                    <p>Strength alone is not enough. It is useful only in the service of a concept
                        of the national interest and when wielded with creativity, wisdom, and
                        compassion to shape the course of events. Thus our true strength is not
                        military power, but the dedication of a free people which knows its
                        responsibility, which has a vision of what it seeks and the courage to seek
                        it.</p>
                    <p>The United States has never been defeated for lack of military power. All our
                        recent setbacks, from Indochina to Angola, have been self-inflicted; they
                        have occurred because of divisions among ourselves that paralyzed our
                        action.</p>
                    <p>Together there is little we cannot do. Divided, there is little we can
                        attempt.</p>
                    <p>The most urgent challenge before America is a national consensus on our
                        purposes and objectives. As a nation, we must maintain the balance of power
                        and have the vision to fulfill positive aspirations. There is no ultimate
                        safety in a balance of terror constantly contested. We must vigilantly
                        protect our own security and that of our allies and <pb n="429" facs="0460"
                            xml:id="pg_429"/>friends, but we must also seek to build habits of
                        communication and relationships of cooperation.</p>
                    <p>With respect to our adversaries, we are determined to resist moves to gain
                        unilateral benefits by military pressure, direct or indirect. The United
                        States will not accept any further Angolas. At the same time, we owe it to
                        ourselves and to the world to seek to push back the shadow of nuclear
                        holocaust, to slow the strategic arms race, to resolve political problems
                        through negotiation, and to expand our relations on the basis of strict
                        reciprocity.</p>
                    <p>This process is meant to serve, not to sacrifice, our interests and values.
                        The state of relations between the United States and the Communist powers is
                        vastly better today for us and for global peace than it was 10 years ago,
                        when crises were frequent, when communication was rudimentary, and when the
                        world did not have the luxury of criticizing efforts to reduce tensions.</p>
                    <p>Our policy in the Middle East, similarly, is designed to serve our most
                        positive goals. The extraordinary steps that have been taken in the last few
                        years between Arab states and Israel have brought us progress undreamed of a
                        few short years ago. The process of negotiation between the parties is
                        continuing; the United States remains in a pivotal position to promote a
                        balanced negotiation, to support friends, and dampen conflicts. The Middle
                        East today is at a moment of unprecedented opportunity:</p>
                    <p>—Israel has shown in negotiation the boldness for which it is renowned in
                        battle, and that in turn has made possible concrete political steps toward a
                        durable peace settlement.</p>
                    <p>—Some of the Arab countries are now at last speaking openly and wisely of
                        making peace and bringing an end to generations of conflict.</p>
                    <p>—The United States has shown its determination and ability to promote a just
                        and enduring solution between the parties, to prevent this region from again
                        becoming the focal point of global crisis.</p>
                    <p>—If we continue to conduct our relationship with the major outside powers
                        with reason and firmness, we can move toward a global environment of
                        restraint that will enhance even further the possibilities of constructive
                        negotiation and progress.</p>
                    <p>The negotiations ahead in the Middle East will present difficult obstacles
                        and difficult decisions. We understand the complexity of Israel’s position.
                        Any negotiation will require Israel to exchange territory in return for
                        political, and therefore much less concrete, concessions. Even Israel’s
                        ultimate goals—a peace treaty and recognition from its neighbors—are
                        inherently intangible. But they would be the greatest step toward security
                        since the creation of the State. We do not underestimate the dilemmas and
                        risks that Israel faces in a negotiation; but they <pb n="430" facs="0461"
                            xml:id="pg_430"/>are dwarfed by a continuation of the status quo. And we
                        recognize our obligation, as the principal support for Israel’s security, to
                        be understanding of Israel’s specific circumstances in the process of
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>All of us who are friends of Israel and who are at the same time dedicated to
                        further progress toward peace understand Israel’s uncertainties—and at the
                        same time we share her hope. There will be no imposed solutions; there
                        should be negotiations between the parties that will eventually have to live
                        in peace.</p>
                    <p>It is a delicate but careful process, because no American and no friend of
                        Israel can be ignorant of what is at stake. Much work and many dangers—most
                        immediately the situation in Lebanon—remain, but the peace process has come
                        further than all but a very few dared hope.</p>
                    <p>As the process continues, the United States will not weaken Israel by failing
                        to perceive its needs, or by failing to understand its worries, or by
                        abandoning our fundamental commitment to its survival and security. In this
                        process there is hope; in stagnation there are mounting dangers. Together we
                        can achieve what a few years ago seemed a vain dream: a Middle East whose
                        nations live at peace and with a consciousness of security.</p>

                    <p>A fourth element of American foreign policy is our commitment to sustain the
                        world economic order. A dominant issue of international relations for the
                        next generation will be the economic division of our planet between North
                        and South—industrial and developing—which has become as pressing an issue as
                        the division between East and West. I have just returned from Nairobi, from
                        addressing a meeting of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, where

                    </p>
                    <p>Peace would be fragile indeed in a world of economic stagnation or
                        frustration, in an era of economic warfare or unremitting hostility between
                        the industrial world and the developing world. In the last few years the
                        world community has been reminded dramatically by the oil embargo and the
                        ensuing recession of the extent to which economic relations are an essential
                        foundation of the international order. Bold new policies are needed to make
                        the international economic system more secure and more dynamic. Therefore,
                        just as we seek to move beyond a balance of power in East–West relations, so
                        must we transcend tests of <pb n="431" facs="0462" xml:id="pg_431"/>strength
                        in North–South relations in favor of more creative and constructive
                        relationships in tune with the sweep of human aspirations.</p>
                    <p>We do so in our own self-interest. As the world’s strongest power, the United
                        States could survive an era of economic warfare. But the American people
                        would not be true to ourselves were we to turn our backs on the legitimate
                        hopes of tens of millions for a better life. Our own self-interest requires
                        us to use our preeminent economic strength to strengthen and build upon the
                        interdependence of all nations in the global economy.</p>
                    <p>No other country has our opportunity to build long-term relations of
                        partnership in helping nations to develop their resources and economies. All
                        over the globe American economic strength is admired and sought; it should
                        be seen by us not as a “giveaway” but as an unmatchable advantage which can
                        be creatively used to strengthen our diplomacy for peace and the prospects
                        of a stable and just world order.</p>
                    <p>Israel, too, has made a great contribution to the cause of constructive
                        relations between the advanced and the developing countries. The imagination
                        and creativity which the pioneering settlers of Israel used to make the
                        desert bloom have been generously offered to many developing countries. We
                        support those initiatives, and we will do what we can to assist them.</p>
                    <p>Israel faces serious economic difficulties in the years ahead, partly
                        because—let us face it squarely—Moses had some shortcomings as a petroleum
                        geologist. In place of natural resources, Israel’s economy must be driven by
                        creativity, hard work, and determination—assets which fortunately are in
                        abundance in that little country. To prosper, Israel must have access to
                        world markets, and countries and companies that wish to trade with her must
                        be free to do so.</p>
                    <p>The United States will continue to help Israel’s economy overcome world
                        recession, higher petroleum prices, and the costs of a strong national
                        defense. The United States is committed to ending restrictions on Israel’s
                        rights to trade and on the rights of others to trade with Israel. Steps
                        toward peace in the political and military field must include steps to end
                        the economic warfare.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">America and Israel</p>
                    <p>As America makes progress toward all its broad objectives of global peace and
                        well-being, the world is made safer for all countries that rely on us. But
                        if legislative battles and domestic divisions weaken America’s leadership,
                        it will not be America alone which pays the price. Our friends and allies
                        will grievously suffer.</p>
                    <p>Americans and Israelis must work together creatively and boldly in the
                        challenging period ahead. Diplomacy at its best is a process of creation,
                        not of passive reactions to events. For Americans and Israelis <pb n="432"
                            facs="0463" xml:id="pg_432"/>above all, who have always shaped actions
                        out of purposes, there is no excuse for political wrangling that in perilous
                        times makes coherent and purposive action impossible.</p>
                    <p>America has a special responsibility. Never has there been any question about
                        our physical power. As our economy rebounds from recession, there is every
                        reason for confidence about our long-term—and indeed permanent—superiority
                        in the economic and technological strength that is the basis of our military
                        power as well as of our economic welfare. The challenge to us at this point
                        in our history is whether we can restore the consensus and national
                        confidence that can make this power effective for our goals.</p>
                    <p>I am optimistic. We are not weak; we are only hesitant. It lies within us to
                        remedy our difficulties.</p>
                    <p>The former Foreign Minister of France, Maurice Couve de Murville, said on the
                        floor of the French Assembly three days ago:</p>
                    <p>The instability in the world is above all a result of the American crisis
                        caused by the defeat in Viet-Nam and the Watergate affair, rather than by
                        the increase in Soviet power . . .</p>
                    <p>Americans know that when all is said and done, there cannot be peace for one
                        nation; there must be peace for all nations, or all are in jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>The world looks to us. This is one fact that I have found, whatever continent
                        I have visited—Africa, Latin America, Asia, or Europe. Although we no longer
                        enjoy the preponderant power we once had, we are still the strongest single
                        country and a nation recognized throughout the world for its honesty, its
                        decency and unselfishness. If we persevere, if we use our great moral and
                        physical influence to maintain the balance of power, promote world
                        prosperity, mediate conflicts, and put our considerable weight on the scales
                        of justice—if, in short, we do as we have always done—we will usher in an
                        unparalleled period of progress and peace.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_RFD_1">Roosevelt</persName> once said that
                        his generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. Let it be said of
                        our generation of Americans that they have had a rendezvous with peace and
                        with progress.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I believe that our public statements haven’t yet brought into focus the
                        essentially political dynamics of the North-South challenge. The more
                        “conservative” elements within our and other governments believe that the
                        situation is basically static except for a growing discontent on the part of
                        the <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s; to preserve our democratic-free
                        enterprise-market system, they would resist any significant change in our
                        policies toward the “South.” Although not yet clearly articulated, I believe
                        that the evolving State Department concept reflects acceptance of the
                        fundamental dynamics of the North-South relationship which makes essential
                        an adjustment in our international economic relations so as to assure the
                        survival of our market system.</p>
                    <p>The underlying trends which support the concept of a dynamic North-South
                        relationship include the following:</p>
                    <p>(A) The world became intoxicated with the illusion of independence with the
                        number of independent states almost quadrupling in 30 years from 40 to over
                        150 today.</p>
                    <p>(B) Many if not most of the newly independent states haven’t the essential
                        elements for a viable economic independence let alone the managerial
                        competence to adjust economic enterprise to the ever changing international
                        commercial realities. We are now witnessing the progressive unraveling of
                        these economies with loss of the momentum created prior to the cutting of
                        the life-sustaining umbilical cord to their “colonial exploiters.” A sense
                        of angry desperation now aligns these “masses” of the community of nations
                        with the champions of radical change in the international economic
                        order.</p>
                    <p>(C) At the same time that the world was on its independence kick there was a
                        counter current in the form of a techno-commercial revolution which created
                        an accelerating global economic interdependence. This trend impacted on both
                        industrialized and developing worlds. While the <gloss target="#t_LDC_1"
                            >LDC</gloss>’s were losing their independence, the industrialized na<pb
                            n="434" facs="0465" xml:id="pg_434"/>tions also became increasingly
                        dependent on the <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s—for energy and raw
                        materials to balance expanding needs with decreasing availability at home
                        and for markets for our expanding exports.</p>
                    <p>(D) These trends have intensified pressures for governmental and
                        inter-governmental action on a broad range of economic issues.
                        Interdependence inevitably will heighten demands for governmental
                        interventions in the market place. This is seen most clearly today in the
                        energy field but will develop in other fields of international economic
                        relations. The issues are economic but also profoundly political. Thus the
                        traditional distinctions between economic and political aspects of our
                        foreign relations are no longer valid.</p>
                    <p>This synopsis illustrates our need to treat North-South issues as a dynamic
                        challenge to mankind’s sensitivities and imagination. Unless we develop
                        equitable and effective means of responding to the reality of a rapidly
                        changing world we will not be able to preserve or extend the basic elements
                        of the democratic-free enterprise-market system.</p>
                    <p>What are the consequences of a continuation of these trends? An expanding
                        number of <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s will be offered the choice
                        of a radical “new international economic order” or increasing dependence on
                        multilateral financial institutions controlled by the industrialized
                        nations—the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1"
                            >IBRD</gloss>, creditor clubs (and now, some would argue, <gloss
                            target="#t_IRB_1">IRB</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IFAD_1"
                        >IFAD</gloss>). The conditions attached to these agencies’ expanded
                        assistance will be resented in the South as “neocolonialism”—benign,
                        perhaps, but nonetheless a further erosion of their new independence. In
                        this situation the politics of the “common front” will rally governments
                        that should know better to the cause of international bureaucratic
                        management of markets, production and prices through <gloss
                            target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>-dominated institutions. This is the real
                        objective of the <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss> common fund
                        planners. It is the essence of the North-South confrontation.</p>
                    <p>What should we be doing to turn this set of mutual problems toward a more
                        rational resolution? First, we must create a deeper understanding of the
                        challenge within the U.S. Government, Congress and public. Second, we must
                        establish a common understanding among the industrialized countries. Third,
                        we must design a better orchestrated effort to adjust international economic
                        institutions and all aspects of economic relations to the reality of
                        interdependence while preserving the market system.</p>
                    <p>To achieve this the U.S. must take the lead in modifying and strengthening
                        the concentric rings of international organizations in which we have strong
                        influence to develop a more coherent and cohesive approach. These rings
                        start with the U.S. at the center, moving out through an inner core of
                        industrialized nations (including <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>,
                        Japan, <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, France and the U.S.), to the
                            <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>, then a <gloss target="#t_CIEC_1"
                            >CIEC</gloss> type body with se<pb n="435" facs="0466" xml:id="pg_435"
                        />lected participants representing global interests and finally to a global
                        institution to provide formal legitimacy.</p>
                    <p>The industrialized-nation inner core would develop from bilateral and ad hoc
                        arrangements. The <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> must be made more
                        effective by strengthening and expanding the mandate of its Executive
                        Committee. We must continue our efforts to build on this process, with the
                        State Department controlling over-all coordination of international economic
                        policies. This can be achieved through the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1"
                            >OECD</gloss> Executive Committee, with the Under Secretary of State for
                        Economic Affairs playing the lead role for the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_CIEC_1">CIEC</gloss> can be a crucial element in
                        reconciling the views of North and South. It is not too soon to begin our
                        planning for <gloss target="#t_CIEC_1">CIEC</gloss> in some modified form
                        beyond its initial trial year. This will require an in depth analysis of the
                        North-South issues and alternatives for modifying <gloss target="#t_CIEC_1"
                            >CIEC</gloss> to gain both effectiveness and legitimacy.</p>
                    <p>The key requirement is to demonstrate readiness to cooperate and adjust.
                        Neither supine concessions to radical demands nor a stand-pat “them versus
                        us” resistance to change should be our posture. The over-all design of our
                        responses to the challenge already has been largely articulated in your
                        addresses to the U.N. Seventh Special Session<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">See

                    <p>In all of these measures we must recognize the diversity of the <gloss

                        problems and political outlooks. To summarize:</p>

                    <p>We will either make adjustments in the existing order so as to offer hope to

                        democratic-free enterprise-market system become the dinosaur of the 20th
                        century.</p>
                    <p>This task is a fundamental aspect of our international relations. It demands
                        the elevation of North-South economic relations to a place of continuing
                        priority in our foreign policy machinery, effective assertion of leadership
                        by the State Department within U.S. Government councils dealing with
                        international economic issues, and strengthening of the <gloss

                    <p>In 1973, with Viet-Nam at last behind us, and fresh from new initiatives with
                        China and the Soviet Union, the United States proposed that the
                        collaboration of the industrial democracies be given new impetus.<note n="2"

                        security, while still crucial, was no longer sufficient to give content or
                        political cohesion to our broader relationship or to retain support for it
                        from a new generation. We faced important East-West negotiations on European
                        security and force reductions, a fresh agenda of international economic
                        problems, the challenge of shaping anew our relationship with the developing
                        world, and the need to redefine relations between America and a strengthened
                        and enlarged European community.</p>
                    <p>It is academic to debate now whether the United States acted too
                        theoretically in proposing to approach these challenges through the
                        elaboration of a new Atlantic Declaration, or whether our European friends
                        acted wisely in treating this proposal as a test case of European identity.
                        The doctrinal arguments of 1973 over the procedure for Atlantic
                        consultations, or whether Europe was exercising its proper global role, or
                        whether economic and security issues should be linked, have in fact been
                        settled by the practice of consultations and cooperation unprecedented in
                        intensity and scope. The reality and success of our common endeavors have
                        provided the best definition and revitalization of our relationship.</p>
                    <p>There is no longer any question that Europe and the United States must
                        cooperate closely under whatever label and that the unity of Europe is
                        essential to that process.</p>
                    <p>In its early days, the European Community was the focus of much American
                        idealism, and perhaps of some paternalism, as we urged models of federal
                        unity and transatlantic burden sharing on our European friends. By now,
                        leaders on both sides of the Atlantic have come to understand that European
                        unity cannot be built by Americans or to an American prescription; it must
                        result from European initiatives.</p>
                    <p>The evolution of European initiatives—both its successes and its
                        setbacks—inevitably gives rise to new questions about whether the United
                        States still welcomes European unification. Let me take this occasion to
                        emphasize our conviction that European unity is crucial for Europe, for the
                        West, and for the world. We strongly support and encourage it.</p>
                    <p>We have perhaps become a little more sophisticated about our contribution to
                        the process. We no longer expect that it will grow from the desire to ease
                        American burdens. If Europe is to carry a part of the <pb n="438"
                            facs="0469" xml:id="pg_438"/>West’s responsibilities in the world, it
                        must do so according to its own conceptions and in its own interest.</p>
                    <p>Alastair Buchan wrote:</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to inspire Western Europe to political unity or to encourage
                        Japanese self-reliance unless they have the freedom and confidence to define
                        their interests in every sphere, interests which must be reconciled with
                        those of the United States but not subordinated to them.</p>
                    <p>The United States endorses this principle wholeheartedly. It is not healthy
                        for the United States to be the only center of initiative and leadership in
                        the democratic world. It is not healthy for Europe to be only a passive
                        participant, however close the friendship and however intimate the
                        consultation.</p>
                    <p>We therefore welcome the fact that Europe’s role in global affairs is gaining
                        in vigor and effectiveness. A vital and cohesive Western Europe is an
                        irreplaceable weight on the scales of global diplomacy; American policy can
                        only gain by having a strong partner of parallel moral purposes.</p>
                    <p>Of course we do not want Europe to find its identity in opposition to the
                        United States. But neither does any sensible European. Of course there will
                        be disagreements between us of tactics and sometimes of perspectives, if not
                        of ends. But I do not believe that we Americans have so lost confidence in
                        ourselves that we must inhibit the role of others with whom we may have
                        occasional differences but who share our highest values. The wisest
                        statesmen on the two sides of the ocean have always known that European
                        unity and Atlantic partnership are both essential and mutually
                        reinforcing.</p>
                    <p>So let us finally put behind us the debates over whether Europe’s unity has
                        American support. We consider the issue settled. Let us, rather, address
                        ourselves to the urgent challenges of mutual concern which a uniting Europe,
                        the United States, and all industrial democracies must face together—common
                        defense, East-West relations, and the international economy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Security and the Democracies</p>
                    <p>Security is the bedrock of all that we do. A quarter century ago, the
                        American defense commitment to Europe provided the shield behind which
                        Western Europe recovered its economic health and political vitality. Today,
                        our collective defense alliance—and the U.S.-Japanese relationship—continue
                        to be essential for global stability. But the nature of security and
                        strategy has fundamentally changed since the time when our alliances were
                        founded:</p>
                    <p>—The Soviet Union has recovered from the devastation of World War II and
                        pressed vigorously ahead on the path of industrial growth. <pb n="439"
                            facs="0470" xml:id="pg_439"/>Possessing resources on a continental scale
                        and imposing on its people enormous sacrifices in the name of its ideology,
                        the U.S.S.R. has developed its economic strength and technology to a point
                        where it can match the West in many sectors of industrial and military
                        power. It shows no signs of changing its priorities.</p>
                    <p>—For centuries, it was axiomatic that increases in military power could be
                        translated into almost immediate political advantage. It is now clear that
                        in strategic weaponry, new increments of weapons or destructiveness do not
                        automatically lead to either military or political gains. The
                        destructiveness of strategic weapons has contributed to the emergence of
                        nuclear stalemate. Neither side, if it acts with minimum prudence, will let
                        the balance tip against it, either in an arms race or in an agreement to
                        limit arms.</p>
                    <p>—Beneath the nuclear umbrella, the temptation to probe with regional forces
                        or proxy wars increases. The steady growth of Soviet conventional military
                        and naval power and its expanding global reach cannot be ignored.
                        Conventional forces and military assistance to allies assume pivotal
                        importance. We must insure that the strength and flexibility of all forces
                        capable of local defense are enhanced. And we must conduct a prudent and
                        forceful foreign policy that is prepared to use our strength to block
                        expansionism.</p>
                    <p>These new realities demand from us steadiness, above all. Democratic
                        societies have always fluctuated in their attitude toward defense—between
                        complacency and alarmist concern. The long leadtimes of modern weapons and
                        their complexity make both these aberrations dangerous. We cannot afford
                        alternation between neglect and bursts of frenzy if we are to have a
                        coherent defense program and public support for the necessary exertions. We
                        need an allied defense posture that is relevant to our dangers, credible to
                        both friends and adversaries, and justifiable to our peoples. And we must be
                        prepared to sustain it over the long term.</p>
                    <p>It is imperative that we maintain the programs that insure that the balance
                        is preserved. But we owe it to ourselves to see the military balance in
                        proper perspective. Complacency may produce weakness, but exaggeration of
                        danger can lead to a loss of will. To be sure, there has been a steady
                        buildup of Soviet military power. But we have also seen to the steady growth
                        and improvement of our own forces over the same period.</p>
                    <p>—We have always had to face Soviet ground forces larger than our own, partly
                        because of the Soviet Union’s definition of its needs as a power in the
                        heart of the Eurasian landmass, with perceived threats on both flanks. Its
                        naval power, while a growing and serious problem, is far weaker than
                        combined allied naval strength in terms of tonnage, firepower, range, access
                        to the sea, experience, and seamanship.</p>
                    <pb n="440" facs="0471" xml:id="pg_440"/>
                    <p>—The United States, for its part, is expanding its Army from 13 to 16
                        divisions through new measures of streamlining forces; we are increasing our
                        combat forces in Europe; we plan to station a new Army brigade on the
                        critical sector of the north German plain; we are augmenting our naval
                        forces. Our European allies have completed major programs to build common
                        infrastructure. We have undertaken new joint efforts of standardization and
                        interoperability of allied forces.</p>
                    <p>—U.S. strategic forces are superior in accuracy, diversity, reliability,
                        survivability, and numbers of separately targetable nuclear warheads. We
                        have a commanding lead in strategic bombers. In addition, there are American
                        deployments overseas and the nuclear forces of two Atlantic allies.</p>
                    <p>—Even with our different priorities, the economic and technological base
                        which underlies Western military strength remains overwhelmingly superior in
                        size and capacity for innovation. The Soviet Union suffers endemic weakness
                        in its industry and agriculture; recent studies indicate that this chronic
                        inefficiency extends even into their military sector to a much greater
                        extent than realized before.</p>
                    <p>These strengths of ours demonstrate that our present security posture is
                        adequate and that it is well within our capacities to continue to balance
                        the various elements of Soviet power. To maintain the necessary defense is a
                        question of leadership more than of power. Our security responsibility is
                        both manageable and unending. We must undertake significant additional
                        efforts for the indefinite future. For as far ahead as we can see, we will
                        live in a twilight area between tranquillity and open confrontation.</p>
                    <p>This is a task for both sides of the Atlantic. Our defense effort within the
                        alliance will be importantly affected by the degree to which the American
                        public is convinced that our allies share similar perceptions of the
                        military challenge and a comparable determination to meet it. The greatest
                        threat to the alliance would occur if, for whatever reason—through
                        misreading the threat, or inattention to conventional forces, or reductions
                        of the defense efforts of allies, or domestic developments within <gloss

                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> were weakened.</p>
                    <p>The challenge of building sufficient hardware is easier than those of
                        geopolitical understanding, political coordination, and above all, resolve.
                        In the nuclear age, once a change in the geopolitical balance has become
                        unambiguous, it is too late to do anything about it. However great our
                        strength, it will prove empty if we do not resist seemingly marginal changes
                        whose cumulative impact can undermine our security. Power serves little
                        purpose without the doctrines and concepts which define where our interests
                        require its application.</p>
                    <pb n="441" facs="0472" xml:id="pg_441"/>
                    <p>Therefore let us not paralyze ourselves by a rhetoric of weakness. Let us
                        concentrate on building the understanding of our strategic interests which
                        must underlie any policy. The fact is that nowhere has the West been
                        defeated for lack of strength. Our setbacks have been self-inflicted, either
                        because leaders chose objectives that were beyond our psychological
                        capabilities or because our legislatures refused to support what the
                        executive branch believed was essential. This—and not the various “gaps”
                        that appear in the American debate in years divisible by four—is the deepest
                        security problem we face.</p>

                        functions” the assurance of military security and realistic measures to
                        reduce tensions between East and West. We never considered
                        confrontation—even when imposed on us by the other side—or containment an
                        end in itself. Nor did we believe that disagreements with the Soviet Union
                        would automatically disappear. On the contrary, the very concept of
                        “détente” has always been applicable only to an adversary relationship. It
                        was designed to prevent competition from sliding into military hostilities
                        and to create the conditions for the relationship to be gradually and
                        prudently improved.</p>
                    <p>Thus, alliance policy toward the East has two necessary dimensions. We seek
                        to prevent the Soviet Union from transforming its military power into
                        political expansion. At the same time, we seek to resolve conflicts and
                        disputes through negotiation and to strengthen the incentives for moderation
                        by expanding the area of constructive relations.</p>
                    <p>These two dimensions are mutually reinforcing. A strong defense and
                        resistance to adventurism are prerequisites for efforts of conciliation. By
                        the same token, only a demonstrated commitment to peace can sustain domestic
                        support for an adequate defense and a vigilant foreign policy. Our public
                        and Congress will not back policies which appear to invite crises, nor will
                        they support firmness in a crisis unless they are convinced that peaceful
                        and honorable alternatives have been exhausted. Above all, we owe it to
                        ourselves and to future generations to seek a world based on something more
                        stable and hopeful than a balance of terror constantly contested.</p>

                    <p>However we label such a policy, it is imposed by the unprecedented conditions
                        of the nuclear age. No statesman can lightly risk the lives of tens of
                        millions. Every American President, after entering office and seeing the
                        facts, has come to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName>’s view that there is no alternative to peace.</p>
                    <p>Our generation has been traumatized by World War II, because we remember that
                        war broke out as a result of an imbalance of power. This is a lesson we must
                        not forget. But neither must we forget the lesson of World War I, when war
                        broke out despite an equilibrium of power. An international structure held
                        together only by a balance of forces will sooner or later collapse in
                        catastrophe. In our time this could spell the end of civilized life. We must
                        therefore conduct a diplomacy that deters challenges if possible and that
                        contains them at tolerable levels if they prove unavoidable—a diplomacy that
                        resolves issues, nurtures restraint, and builds cooperation based on mutual
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>This policy has critics in all our countries. Some take for granted the
                        relative absence of serious crises in recent years, which the policy has
                        helped to bring about, and then fault it for not producing the millennium,
                        which it never claimed. Some caricature its objectives, portraying its goals
                        in more exalted terms than any of its advocates, and then express dismay at
                        the failure of reality to conform to this impossible standard. They describe
                        détente as if it meant the end of all rivalry; when rivalry persists, they
                        conclude that détente has failed and charge its advocates with deception or
                        naivete. They measure the success of policy toward adversaries by criteria
                        that should be reserved for traditional friendships. They use the reality of
                        competition to attack the goal of coexistence, rather than to illustrate its
                        necessity.</p>
                    <p>In fact, this policy has never been based on such hope or gullibility. It has
                        always been designed to create conditions in which a cool calculus of
                        interests would dictate restraint rather than opportunism, settlement of
                        conflicts rather than their exacerbation. Western policies can at best
                        manage and shape, not assume away, East-West competition.</p>
                    <p>A pivot of the East-West relationship is the U.S.-Soviet negotiation on
                        limitation of strategic arms. Increasingly, strategic forces find their
                        function only in deterring and matching each other. A continuing buildup of
                        strategic arms therefore only leads to fresh balances, but at higher levels
                        of expenditures and uncertainties. In an era of expanding technological
                        possibilities, it is impossible to make rational choices of force planning
                        without some elements of predictability in the strategic environment.
                        Moreover, a continuing race diverts resources from other needed areas such
                        as forces for regional defense, where imbalances can have serious
                        geopolitical consequences. All these factors have made arms limitation a
                        practical interest of both sides, as well as a factor for stability in the
                        world.</p>
                    <pb n="443" facs="0474" xml:id="pg_443"/>
                    <p>We have made considerable progress toward curbing the strategic arms race in
                        recent years. We will continue vigorously to pursue this objective in ways
                        which protect Western interests and reflect the counsel of our allies.</p>
                    <p>In defining and pursuing policies of relaxing tensions with the East, the
                        unity of the industrial democracies is essential. Our consultations have
                        been intensive and frequent, and the record of Western cohesion in recent
                        years has been encouraging—in the negotiations leading to the Four Power
                        Agreement on Berlin, in the mutual and balanced force reduction talks, in
                        the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations [Strategic Arms
                        Limitation Talks], and in the preparation for the European Security
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>Allied cooperation and the habits of consultation and coordination which we
                        have formed will be even more important in the future. For as the policy of
                        relaxing tensions proceeds, it will involve issues at the heart of all our
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>No one should doubt the depth of our commitment to this process. But we also
                        need to be clear about its limits and about our conception of
                        reciprocity:</p>
                    <p>—We should require consistent patterns of behavior in different parts of the
                        world. The West must make it clear that coexistence requires mutual
                        restraint, not only in Europe and in the central strategic relationship but
                        also in the Middle East, in Africa, in Asia—in fact, globally. The <gloss

                    <p>—We should make clear the tolerable definition of global ideological rivalry.
                        We do not shrink from ideological competition. We have every reason for
                        confidence in the indestructible power of man’s yearning for freedom. But we
                        cannot agree that ideology alone is involved when Soviet power is extended
                        into areas such as southern Africa in the name of “national liberation” or
                        when regional or local instabilities are generated or exploited in the name
                        of “proletarian internationalism.”</p>
                    <p>—We should not allow the Soviet Union to apply détente selectively within the
                        alliance. Competition among us in our diplomatic or economic policies toward
                        the East risks dissipating Western advantages and opening up Soviet
                        opportunities. We must resist division and maintain the closest
                        coordination.</p>

                    <p>The process of improving East-West relations in Europe must not be confined
                        to relations with the Soviet Union. The benefits of relaxation of tensions
                        must extend to Eastern as well as Western Europe. There should be no room
                        for misconceptions about U.S. policy:</p>
                    <p>—We are determined to deal with Eastern Europe on the basis of the
                        sovereignty and independence of each of its countries. We recognize no
                        spheres of influence and no pretensions to hegemony. Two American Presidents

                        and independence of those nations.</p>
                    <p>—For the same reason, we will persist in our efforts to improve our contacts
                        and develop our concrete bilateral relations in economic and other fields
                        with the countries of Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>—The United States supports the efforts of West European nations to
                        strengthen their bilateral and regional ties with the countries of Eastern
                        Europe. We hope that this process will help heal the divisions of Europe
                        which have persisted since World War II.</p>
                    <p>—And we will continue to pursue measures to improve the lives of the people
                        in Eastern Europe in basic human terms—such as freer emigration, the
                        unification of families, greater flow of information, increased economic
                        interchange, and more opportunities for travel.</p>
                    <p>The United States, in parallel with its allies, will continue to expand
                        relationships with Eastern Europe as far and as fast as is possible. This is
                        a long-term process; it is absurd to imagine that one conference by itself
                        can transform the internal structure of Communist governments. Rhetoric is
                        no substitute for patient and realistic actions. We will raise no
                        expectations that we cannot fulfill. But we will never cease to assert our
                        traditional principles of human liberty and national self-determination.</p>
                    <p>The course of East-West relations will inevitably have its obstacles and
                        setbacks. We will guard against erosion of the gains that we have made in a
                        series of difficult negotiations; we will insure that agreements already
                        negotiated are properly implemented. We must avoid both sentimentality that
                        would substitute good will for strength and mock toughness that would
                        substitute posturing for a clear conception of our purposes.</p>
                    <p>We in the West have the means to pursue this policy successfully. Indeed, we
                        have no realistic alternative. We have nothing to fear from <pb n="445"

                        competition, the power of our ideas depends only on our will to uphold
                        them.</p>
                    <p>We need only to stay together and stay the course. If we do so, the process
                        of East-West relations can, over time, strengthen the fabric of peace and
                        genuinely improve the lives of all the peoples around the world.</p>

                    <p>One of the greatest strengths of the industrial democracies is their
                        unquestioned economic preeminence. Partly because we are committed to the
                        free market system which has given us this preeminence, we have not yet
                        fully realized the possibilities—indeed, the necessity—of applying our
                        economic strength constructively to shaping a better international
                        environment.</p>
                    <p>The industrial democracies together account for 65 percent of the world’s
                        production and 70 percent of its commerce. Our economic performance drives
                        international trade and finance. Our investment, technology, managerial
                        expertise, and agricultural productivity are the spur to development and
                        well-being around the world. Our enormous capacities are multiplied if we
                        coordinate our policies and efforts.</p>

                        important economic and political factor. This growth reflects our
                        fundamental strength. It carries risks and complications, both political and
                        economic. But it also presents opportunities for stabilizing relations and
                        involving the Communist countries in responsible international conduct. If
                        the democracies pursue parallel policies—not allowing the Communist states
                        to stimulate debilitating competition among us or to manipulate the process
                        for their own unilateral advantage—East-West economic relations can be a
                        factor for peace and well-being.</p>
                    <p>We must insure that benefits are reciprocal. We must avoid large trade
                        imbalances which could open opportunities for political pressure. We should
                        structure economic relations so that the Communist states will be drawn into
                        the international economic system and accept its disciplines.</p>
                    <p>When dealing with centrally controlled state economies, we have to realize
                        that economic relations have a high degree of political content and cannot
                        be conducted solely on the normal commercial basis. Obviously, profitability
                        must be one standard, but we need a broader strategy, consistent with our
                        free enterprise system, so that economic relations will contribute to
                        political objectives.</p>
                    <p>The industrial democracies should coordinate their policies to insure the
                        orderly and beneficial evolution of East-West relations. To these ends, the
                        United States has proposed to the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>
                        that we intensify our analyses of the problems and opportunities inherent in
                        East-West trade with a view to charting common objectives and
                        approaches.</p>
                    <p>If the economic strength of the industrial democracies is important to the
                        Socialist countries, it is vital for the developing world. These nations
                        seek to overcome pervasive poverty and to lift the horizons of their
                        peoples. They ask for an equitable share of global economic benefits and a
                        greater role in international decisions that affect them.</p>
                    <pb n="447" facs="0478" xml:id="pg_447"/>
                    <p>The process of development is crucial not only for the poorer nations but for
                        the industrial nations as well. Our own prosperity is closely linked to the
                        raw materials, the markets, and the aspirations of the developing countries.
                        An international order can be stable only if all nations perceive it as
                        fundamentally just and are convinced that they have a stake in it. Over the
                        long term, cooperative North-South relations are thus clearly in the
                        interest of all, and the objectives of industrial and developing countries
                            <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be complementary.</p>
                    <p>However, the North-South dialogue has been far from smooth. Tactics of
                        pressure and an emphasis on rhetorical victories at conferences have too
                        often created an atmosphere of confrontation. Such attitudes obscure the
                        fundamental reality that development is an arduous long-term enterprise. It
                        will go forward only if both sides face facts without illusions, shunning
                        both confrontation and sentimentality.</p>
                    <p>Far more is involved than the mechanical application of technology and
                        capital to poverty. There must be within the developing country a sense of
                        purpose and direction, determined leadership, and perhaps most important, an
                        impulse for change among the people. Development requires national
                        administration, a complex infrastructure, a revised system of education, and
                        many other social reforms. It is a profoundly unsettling process that takes
                        decades.</p>
                    <p>For many new countries it is in fact even more difficult than similar efforts
                        by the Western countries a century ago, for their social and geographic
                        conditions reflect the arbitrary subdivisions of colonial rule. Some face
                        obstacles which could not be surmounted even with the greatest exertions on
                        their own. Their progress depends on how well the international community
                        responds to the imperatives of economic interdependence.</p>
                    <p>It is senseless, therefore, to pretend that development can proceed by quick
                        fixes or one-shot solutions. Artificial majorities at international
                        conferences confuse the issue. Confrontational tactics will in time destroy
                        the domestic support in the industrial countries for the forward-looking
                        policy which the developing countries so desperately need.</p>
                    <p>The industrial democracies have special responsibilities as well. Development
                        requires their sustained and collective cooperation. They represent the
                        largest markets and most of the world’s technology and capital. They have an
                        obligation to show understanding for the plight of the poorest and the
                        striving for progress of all developing nations. But they do the developing
                        countries no favor if they contribute to escapism. If they compete to curry
                        favor over essentially propagandistic issues, contributions will be diluted,
                        resources will go unallocated, and unworkable projects will be
                        encouraged.</p>

                    <p>The developing countries need from us not a sense of guilt but intelligent
                        and realistic proposals that merge the interests of both sides in an
                        expanding world economy:</p>
                    <p>—First, we must develop further the mechanisms of our own cooperation. To
                        this end the United States has made a number of concrete proposals at the
                        recently concluded <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> meeting.<note

                    </p>
                    <p>—Second, the industrial democracies should coordinate their national aid
                        programs better so that we use our respective areas of experience and
                        technical skill to best advantage. [French] President <persName
                            corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard d’Estaing</persName>’s proposal for an
                        integrated Western fund for Africa is an imaginative approach to regional
                        development.</p>
                    <p>—Third, we should regularly consult and work in close parallel in major
                        international negotiations and conferences. The Conference on International
                        Economic Cooperation; the multilateral trade negotiations; U.N. General
                        Assembly special sessions; world conferences on food, population,
                        environment, or housing; and <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss>
                        [U.N. Conference on Trade and Development] all can achieve much more if the
                        industrial democracies approach them with a clear and coherent purpose.</p>
                    <p>—Fourth, we should stop conducting all negotiations on an agenda not our own.
                        We should not hesitate to put forward our own solutions to common
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>—And finally, we need a clear longer term strategy for development. The
                        diverse elements of the process, including various forms of assistance,
                        technology transfer, and trade and financial policy, must be better
                        integrated.</p>
                    <p>Cooperation among developed countries is not confrontation between North and
                        South, as is often alleged. The fact is that a responsible development
                        policy is possible only if the industrial democracies pursue realistic goals
                        with conviction, compassion, and coordination. They must not delude
                        themselves or their interlocutors by easy panaceas, or mistake slogans for
                        progress. We make the greatest contribution to development if we insist that
                        the North-South dialogue emphasize substance rather than ideology and
                        concentrate on practical programs instead of empty theological debates.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Future of Democratic Societies</p>
                    <p>In every dimension of our activities, then, the industrial democracies enter
                        the new era with substantial capacities and opportunities. <pb n="449"
                            facs="0480" xml:id="pg_449"/>At the same time, it would be idle to deny
                        that in recent years the moral stamina of the West has been seriously
                        challenged.</p>
                    <p>Since its beginnings, Western civilization has clearly defined the
                        individual’s relationship to society and the state. In southern Europe, the
                        humanism of the Renaissance made man the measure of all things. In northern
                        Europe, the Reformation, in proclaiming the priesthood of all believers and
                        offering rewards for individual effort, put the emphasis on the individual.
                        In England, the sense of justice and human rights and responsibilities
                        evolved in the elaboration of the common law. Two hundred years ago the
                        authors of our Declaration of Independence drew upon this heritage; to them
                        every human being had inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit
                        of happiness. The state existed to protect the individual and permit full
                        scope for the enjoyment of these rights.</p>
                    <p>Today in the West, 30 years after the Marshall plan, our deepest challenge is
                        that a new generation must explore again the issues of liberty and social
                        responsibility, in an era when societies have grown vastly in size,
                        complexity, and dynamism.</p>
                    <p>The modern industrial society, though founded in freedom and offering
                        prosperity, risks losing the individual in the mass and fostering his
                        alienation. The technical complexity of public issues challenges the
                        functioning of democracy. Mass media and the weakening of party and group
                        structures further the isolation of the individual; they transform
                        democratic politics, adding new elements of volatility and unpredictability.
                        The bureaucratic state poses a fundamental challenge to political leadership
                        and responsiveness to public will.</p>
                    <p>Basic moral questions are raised: How do we inspire a questioning new
                        generation in a relativistic age and in a society of impersonal
                        institutions? Will skepticism and cynicism sap the spiritual energies of our
                        civilization at the moment of its greatest technical and material success?
                        Having debunked authority, will our societies now seek refuge in false
                        simplifications, demagogic certitudes, or extremist panaceas?</p>
                    <p>These questions are not a prediction but a test—a test of the creativity and
                        moral fortitude of our peoples and leaders.</p>
                    <p>Western civilization has met such tests before. In the late 15th century,
                        Europe was in a period of gloomy introspection, preoccupied with a sense of
                        despair and mortality. The cities which had sparked its revival following
                        the Islamic conquests were in decline. Its territory was being diminished by
                        the depredations of a powerful invader from the East. Its spiritual,
                        economic, and cultural center—Italy—was a prey to anarchy and
                        dismemberment.</p>
                    <p>And yet Europe at that very moment was already well launched on one of the
                        world’s periods of greatest political and intellectual <pb n="450"
                            facs="0481" xml:id="pg_450"/>advance. The Renaissance and Reformation,
                        the great discoveries, the revival of humanistic values, the industrial and
                        democratic revolutions—these were all to create the character and the
                        dynamism of the Western civilization of which we, on both sides of the
                        Atlantic, are the heirs.</p>
                    <p>Similarly today, the West has assets to meet its challenges and to draw from
                        them the material for new acts of creation. It is our nations that have been
                        the vanguard of the modern age. Intellectually and morally, it is our
                        societies that have proven themselves the vast laboratory of the experiment
                        of modernization. Above all, it is the Western democracies that
                        originated—and keep alive today—the vision of political freedom, social
                        justice, and economic well-being for all peoples. None of us lives up to
                        this vision ideally or all the time. But the rigorous standard by which we
                        judge ourselves is what makes us different from totalitarian societies, of
                        the left or the right.</p>
                    <p>This, then, is our moral task:</p>
                    <p>—First, as democratic governments we must redeem, over and over again, the
                        trust of our peoples. As a nation which has accepted the burden of
                        leadership, the United States has a special responsibility: we must overcome
                        the traumas of the recent period, eradicate their causes, and preserve the
                        qualities which world leadership demands. In Europe, wherever there has been
                        a slackening in governmental responsiveness to the needs of citizens, there
                        should be reform and revival.</p>
                    <p>—Second, we must confront the complexities of a pluralistic world. This calls
                        for more than specific technical solutions. It requires of leaders a
                        willingness to explain the real alternatives, no matter how complicated or
                        difficult. And it requires of electorates an understanding that we must make
                        choices amidst uncertainty, where the outcome may be neither immediate nor
                        reducible to simple slogans.</p>
                    <p>—Third, we must clarify our attitudes toward political forces within Western
                        societies which appeal to electorates on the ground that they may bring
                        greater efficiency to government. But we cannot avoid the question of the
                        commitment of these forces to democratic values nor a concern about the
                        trends that a decision based on temporary convenience would set in motion.
                        At the same time, opposition to these forces is clearly not enough. There
                        must be a response to legitimate social and economic aspirations and to the
                        need for reforms of inadequacies from which these forces derive much of
                        their appeal.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, the solidarity of the democratic nations in the world is essential
                        both as material support and as a moral symbol. There could be no greater
                        inspiration of our peoples than the reaffirmation of their common purpose
                        and the conviction that they can shape their fortune in freedom.</p>

                        campaign. They were as follows: Cuba, China, Cyprus, the Middle East, the
                        Soviet Union and Disarmament, <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> and
                        broader themes i.e. social justice, human rights, redistribution of wealth
                        and Lone Rangerism.</p>
                    <p>While the <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName> memorandum is a
                        valuable starting point, we believe that his list is in need of expansion
                        and modification. We believe that there are at least eighteen issues which
                        will play a role in the election year foreign policy debate. They are as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Style of diplomacy</hi>—<persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                            >Carter</persName> will criticize the <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                            >Ford</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                        foreign policy for excessive secrecy and charge that where mistakes have
                        occurred they could have been prevented by placing greater trust in the
                        judgment of the American people. This approach is similar to that employed
                        by <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> in discussing domestic
                        issues. Not only is it aimed at <pb n="452" facs="0483" xml:id="pg_452"
                        />arousing public resentment at being left out of the process, but it is
                        also designed to emphasize that foreign policy is not radically different
                        from domestic policy and that a person who is competent in one can also
                        successfully execute the other. The best response to criticism involving
                        style is to emphasize how trivial such a charge actually is and to point out
                        how clearly this indicates the lack of a viable alternative to present
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Arms sales</hi>—The Administration’s policy of utilizing
                        arms sales to strike a balance of conventional forces in regions of the
                        world has a negative political aspect. While it is unlikely that <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> can articulate a specific
                        alternative to current arms sales programs without deeply offending the many
                        constituent groups which depend on such sales and looking impractical at the
                        same time, there is a political advantage to expressing general concern over
                        arms sales. In interviews and speeches <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                            >Carter</persName> has proposed greater consultation with other members
                        of the Western alliance and with the Soviet Union to reduce arms sales and
                        failing in that he has suggested through advisors the possibility of
                        unilateral acts of restraint in arms sales. We should expect criticism of
                        America’s role as the world’s leading arms merchant to appear in all of
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>’s foreign policy
                        statements, but at the same time it is unlikely that a detailed counter
                        proposal to present policy will emerge.</p>
                    <p>It may be advisable for the Secretary to express concern over the growing
                        arms trade as an adjunct to a more detailed policy statement on nuclear
                        proliferation (suggested in point 3).</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Nuclear Proliferation</hi>—While the Administration has
                        pursued opportunities for limiting the sale of technology which could be
                        converted into weapons, it has failed to convey this record to the public.
                        Contrary to fact, the Administration is pictured as callous to security,
                        public safety and environmental concerns and oversensitive to the feelings
                        of our allies who are engaged in selling dangerous technology to dangerous
                        governments. <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> may have some
                        difficulty articulating this view as he is so strongly committed to
                        strengthening the Western Alliance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>’s speech at the U.N. on
                        nuclear proliferation<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> addressed the United
                            Nations on nuclear energy and world order on May 13. For the text of
                            this speech, see <hi rend="italic">The Presidential Campaign, 1976</hi>,

                        speeches on this subject can be expected. The significance of <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>’s U.N. speech was not that he
                        radically departed from present policy, but that he expressed more concern
                        and more urgency than the Administration had previously expressed. The
                        Secretary should consider giving a major address devoted entirely to the
                        subject of nuclear proliferation in the near future.</p>

                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Overconcern as to Russian sensitivities</hi>—This broad
                        charge has appeared in interviews with certain key <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> foreign policy advisers. The gist of
                        it is that the United States in recent years has paid too much attention to
                        how the Russians feel on a given world situation and that this approach has
                        immobilized the U.S. They argue that it is time we told the Russians that
                        except for matters of central concern to Moscow we are going to proceed
                        unfettered by their feeling as to the merits of our policy. While this
                        criticism is so broad as to have little relevance to actual policy making,
                        it will in all probability touch a responsive chord with the American
                        people, who throughout the primary season have expressed a general
                        restlessness and dissatisfaction with détente.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Human Rights</hi>—This issue has many aspects. It
                        embraces the problems encountered by Jews in the Soviet Union attempting to
                        emigrate as well as political repression in South America and elsewhere. As
                        to the Russian situation, <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> is
                        opposed to the <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1">Jackson</persName> approach of
                        publicly and directly confronting and embarrassing the Soviet Union on human
                        rights and therefore, this potential difference of opinion has been muted.
                        The human rights issue will focus instead on American policy toward such
                        governments as South Korea and Chile. We anticipate that <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> will express greater willingness to
                        impose economic and political sanctions on countries that engage in torture
                        and other unacceptable political behaviour than has the <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> Administration.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Face of Foreign Policy</hi>—<persName
                            corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> will argue that the <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> foreign policy has been overtaken by world events
                        and conditions. He will argue that the strategic thinkers who were
                        predominant in foreign policy in the past should give way to those with an
                        understanding of economics, the environment and problems of overpopulation.
                        The Secretary should not wait for <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                            >Carter</persName> to acknowledge the sensitivity that the
                        Administration has displayed in dealing with these issues over the last
                        several years. The Secretary should take every opportunity to emphasize that
                        indeed economics, environment and population are of paramount importance and
                        that they are treated as such by the <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                            >Ford</persName> Administration.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Cooperation with Congress</hi>—The <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> nomination is in large part a
                        product of the American people’s exhaustion with issues. The public is not
                        looking for an ideologue. Those who supported <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                            >Carter</persName> during the primaries were willing to accept a
                        candidate who was less than a one-hundred percent champion of their
                        particular interests or viewpoint, but who as a result represented a
                        unifying force with appeal to other constituencies. An easy way for
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> to further capitalize on
                        the public’s exhaustion with issues and willingness to accept generalities
                        in place of specifics is to indicate that a <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                            >Carter</persName> Presidency could cooperate fully and effectively with
                        Congress as opposed to the present Administration with its record of vetoing
                        over 50 pieces of legislation.</p>

                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Dealing with Russia</hi>—The politically sensible way to
                        address Angola and other examples of Russian aggression is to charge that
                        the Administration failed to confront the Russians with their unacceptable
                        behavior at an early enough stage in the process so that the Russians could
                        have modified their behavior without substantial embarrassment. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> has, in fact, criticized the United
                        States for acting too late in Angola and then threatening too much. He
                        promises to go to the Russians confidentially in the very earliest stages of
                        a potential international crisis so that each side can modify its position
                        in a way which will preserve the peace.</p>

                        is vulnerable to the charge that he has paid excessive attention to the
                        sensitivities of Iran and Saudi Arabia and failed to exert maximum pressure
                        on those countries and other members of <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                            >OPEC</gloss> to lower the price of oil. <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                            >Carter</persName>’s most effective approach would be to combine
                        criticism of U.S. efforts to lower the world oil price with charges that we
                        have also neglected human rights and too aggressively pursued arms sales.
                        Clearly these issues merge in the Middle East.</p>

                        destruction has been removed from all nations.</p>
                    <p>Second, he will fault the Administration for a failure to deliver on its
                        promises. He will depict the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process
                        as one of overpromise and underperformance.</p>
                    <p>If <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> marginally favors outside critics
                        such as <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>, it also offers the
                        Administration a most promising opportunity to demonstrate dynamic and
                        competent leadership. The American people appreciate the importance of arms
                        limitations, and a renewed effort ought to be made to convey the
                        Administration’s record to the American People.</p>
                    <p>But more important are the incalculable political benefits to be gained
                        through a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement. The polls
                        have consistently shown that the Secretary and the President receive high
                        ratings for their efforts to achieve world peace. Since <persName

                        such an agreement at his political peril.</p>

                        poorest of the poor.</p>
                    <p>There are several steps which can be taken to ensure that the Administration
                        gets the best of whatever argument may take place on this subject.</p>
                    <p>First, Administration statements should emphasize that the United States
                        leads in proposing workable solutions to the problems of hunger, population
                        control, and economic development, that the Communist world is essentially
                        irrelevant to this debate, and that our positions eschew rhetorical bombast
                        for a clear understanding of economic and moral interests. It should be
                        stated that the U.S. has not participated in these international conferences
                        reluctantly but rather willingly and committed to maintaining a productive
                        dialogue between the industrial world and the LDCs.</p>
                    <p>Second, to enhance the image of determination and continuity, the
                        Administration should sound confident and forwardlooking in announcing plans
                        for participation in international fora during the campaign, in the key
                        December meetings, and beyond. A show of confidence in the merit of our
                        proposals will demonstrate our determination to follow through on our
                        efforts. Any position which is attacked both by the <hi rend="italic">Wall

                        must have something to commend it to reasonable people who are interested in
                        seeing real progress.</p>

                        who has shown no reluctance to promise to “never ever” do many other things

                        the extent that the President stresses his support for a strong national
                        security system.</p>

                            >Carter</persName> will find it difficult to criticize U.S. policy and
                        the Secretary’s efforts to solve the conflict in Southern Africa subsequent
                        to the victory of the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> in Angola. He
                        may, however, focus on U.S. Africa policy in the period 1969–1975 and allege
                        serious neglect. He may use Angola as an example of how he would deal
                        differently with the Russians (see item 8), but these points are not likely
                        to have any major impact—especially in light of the Congressional cutoff of
                        aid to Angola.</p>
                    <p>15. <hi rend="italic">
                            <persName corresp="#p_BHFJ_1">Byrd</persName> Amendment</hi>—This is a
                        promising opportunity for <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> to
                        draw a distinction between his style of leadership and <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>’s. He can question the commitment of
                        the White House to the Lusaka policy in light of the Administration’s
                        failure to press for repeal of the <persName corresp="#p_BHFJ_1"
                            >Byrd</persName> amendment<note n="6" xml:id="d81fn6">See <ref
                                target="#d49fn9">footnote 9, Document 49</ref>.</note>—so that the
                        issue becomes one of competence to deliver on our promises quite apart from
                        the merits of repeal itself. Furthermore, the Secretary’s strong presence in
                        the formulation of this policy, and the White House’s hesitancy at the time
                        of the Texas primary will allow <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                            >Carter</persName> to use this issue, to raise, at least tacitly, the
                        question of <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>’s own leadership
                        ability in foreign affairs.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, politics as well as the merits of the African policy favor a major
                        repeal effort in the Congress this fall. A serious lobbying effort can be
                        successful. There is a new awareness of where long-term American interests
                        really lie, even among the steel companies who are beginning to see the
                        handwriting on the wall for the Smith regime. The large Democratic
                        majorities will realize that, in light of their platform and other
                        statements of policy, they have a major stake in a successful attempt at
                        repeal.</p>
                    <p>Repeal of the <persName corresp="#p_BHFJ_1">Byrd</persName> Amendment this
                        fall would be to the President’s political advantage since it would be a
                        clear example of forceful and determined leadership on the part of his
                        Administration. It would also tend to rebut <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                            >Carter</persName>’s argument that the nation needs a Congress and a
                        President of the same party (see point 7, supra).</p>

                        limited in offering specific alternatives, he can at<pb n="457" facs="0488"
                            xml:id="pg_457"/>tempt to attract the support of <gloss

                        the liberal community at large, by reminding those groups of Administration
                        insensitivity to their concerns at the outset of the crisis. We can expect
                        that <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> will downplay the
                        complexity of the Cyprus situation, and use the issue mostly as an example
                        of Administration failure to press aggressively for a solution which is
                        based on American interests and fundamental human rights.</p>
                    <p>The Cyprus issue need not be a political liability for the Administration.
                        For this to be the case, the Administration must signal to the American
                        People that the Greeks and Turks are currently negotiating in bad faith. Few
                        realize the extent of the antagonism between the various groups in the
                        dispute. The public impression that the missing factor necessary for a
                        solution is a more determined American effort should be squelched as soon as
                        possible. Strong statements by the Secretary or the President to this effect
                        are overdue.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the <gloss target="#t_DCA_1">DCA</gloss>’s with Greece and
                        Turkey and the implications for <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, the
                        Administration must educate the American people to view the Cyprus situation
                        from the perspective of our broader security interests. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>, for all his talk of better
                        cooperation with allies, will probably avoid mentioning the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> implications of Cyprus; but the
                        Administration should hit hard at this point. American interests in the
                        southern flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> must be brought
                        more effectively to the public’s attention—and the basic faults of <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA_1">Makarios</persName>, the Greeks, and the Turks should
                        be exposed—so that any attempt by <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                            >Carter</persName> to portray this problem as one of poor Greek Cypriot
                        refugees suffering because of American recalcitrance can be effectively

                        whether the Democrats will convince Americans that the Administration has
                        talked much but done little to halt terrorism. It would be politically wise

                        still every reason to view <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> as
                        the strong favorite to win the election in November. This has an important
                        ramification for present U.S. foreign policy and the role that the Secretary
                        can play in the fall campaign. On the one hand if the Republicans are to
                        remain in office it is important for every member of the <persName

                        and what <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> proposes. On the

                            >Carter</persName> the Secretary dramatically weakens his ability to

                        expect a change of Administrations in January, they will be reluctant to
                        deal with a lame duck Secretary unless they perceive his foreign policy to
                        be bipartisan in nature. This places the Secretary in a dilemma. It is
                        necessary for him to act the partisan in order for <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> to be reelected, but it is also
                        important to preserve his influence with other governments by appearing
                        nonpartisan. The course that the Secretary eventually charts between these
                        conflicting demands will have an important effect on his relationship with
                        the White House over the next few months and, of course, on the
                        election.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the conflicting demands of partisanship and non-partisanship
                        on the Secretary can best be met by an activist approach to foreign policy
                        in the Fall. Campaigns have not traditionally been a good time for
                        substantive accomplishment, but this campaign is significantly different.
                        Present U.S. policy toward the major unresolved issues i.e., <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, Middle East, and Southern Africa is
                        virtually unchallenged. The reason for this is that <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> has not found a significant body of
                        dissent to those policies. Since apparently present policy is approximately
                        what the American people want, it makes good political sense to give them
                        more of the same and in the process reduce <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                            >Carter</persName> to “me tooism.”</p>
                    <p>This will be a more pleasant way of spending the Fall months than bickering
                        with an increasingly nervous White House over the Secretary’s level of
                        partisanship.</p>

                        advantage.</p>
                    <p>The problems are many, however. And new issues arise constantly, sometimes
                        endangering earlier progress. This memorandum assesses the general state of

                        again rising in Latin America:</p>

                    <p>—except for parts of the Caribbean, anti-American posturings—and with them
                        the Cubans—seem to have lost most of their appeal.</p>
                    <p>These developments reflect a basic trend toward economic and political
                        conservatism. Latin Americans are increasingly sensitive to the need for
                        good relations with the United States.</p>

                    <p>—Politically, governmental changes in Argentina and Peru have accentuated a
                        general swing to the right. The failure of the left has reduced the appeal

                        United States.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Role of Foreign Policy</p>
                    <p>This changed environment is due fundamentally to the renewed vigor of the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> economy and to Latin America’s
                        inability to find acceptable substitutes for <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> enterprise and technology either domestically or from third
                        parties. But our policies have helped. We have shown new flexibility toward
                        Latin America recently on three levels:</p>
                    <p>—Bilaterally, we have made special efforts to reach mutual accommodations
                        without attempting to dictate the domestic policies of the countries
                        concerned. Our commitment to conciliation has been demonstrated by our
                        acceptance of the legitimacy of Latin America’s governments—even in the face
                        of challenges to <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests that in the
                        past might have provoked confrontation or even direct intervention. Our
                        pragmatism in dealing with Venezuela’s iron and oil nationalizations and our
                        efforts to resolve the Marcona expropriation in Peru have demonstrated that
                        investment disputes need not entail irreconcilable conflicts. These policies
                        have contributed decisively to more favorable Latin American attitudes
                        toward private investment and to a lessening of quasi-Marxist ideological
                        preoccupations.</p>
                    <p>—Regionally, we have reaffirmed our commitment to the <gloss

                        to Latin American concerns. In joining a majority move to end mandatory
                            <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> sanctions against Cuba, we did more
                        than remove a source of multilateral tension and shift attention to Cuba’s
                        own behavior as the reason for its continuing isolation. We also made clear
                        our interest in the survival of the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> and

                        year on cooperation for development.</p>
                    <p>—Globally, we have shown growing awareness of North-South concerns.

                        on bilateral relations and on the elaboration of possible regional

                    <p>This record is based on gradual case-by-case progress, with no sweeping new
                        programs or attempts to force countries into a single mold. Though
                        inherently difficult to articulate in inspiring terms, such <pb n="461"
                            facs="0492" xml:id="pg_461"/>a pattern of pragmatic adjustment is
                        congruent both with our limitations and Latin America’s. Moreover, if we can
                        sustain this approach and avoid major mistakes for a few more years, Latin
                        America’s growth may be sufficient to facilitate more constructive and
                        balanced relations in the future.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problem Areas</p>
                    <p>Some observers believe, however, that we may be on the verge of a new period
                        of recriminations and mutual alienation. Their chief fear is that the
                        implacable campaign now underway in South America to eradicate terrorism
                        will provoke equally rigid American reactions in defense of human rights.
                        The powerful emotions and frustrations thus unleashed on both sides, they
                        argue, will inexorably destroy the gains of the past year and create fresh
                        obstacles to cooperation for years to come.</p>
                    <p>Latin American conditions have always tended to elicit cataclysmic
                        visions—and agonized responses—from American observers. Nonetheless, three
                        problem areas seem particularly significant:</p>
                    <p>—limitations in our capacity to muster the resources to take advantage of our
                        increased opportunities for cooperation;</p>
                    <p>—weaknesses in Latin America’s capacity to respond constructively; and</p>
                    <p>—the disruptive potential of the human rights issue.</p>
                    <p>Of the three, the human rights issue is the most delicate, for it could bring
                        out the worst aspects of our other difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Our limitations are substantial. Domestic political and economic conditions
                        severely constrain our flexibility on investment disputes and access to
                        markets. We have made—and can continue to make—piecemeal progress. Executive
                        branch efforts have softened potential conflicts over trade with Brazil and
                        Colombia, and investments with Venezuela and Peru. But the underlying
                        problems remain, and increasingly affect our relationships even with Mexico.
                        We cannot get Congress to make Venezuela and Ecuador eligible for <gloss
                            target="#t_GSP_1">GSP</gloss>—let alone meet the desires of those Latin
                        Americans who seek new regional trade preferences. Nor have we been
                        responsive to advocates of the development of assistance, trading, and
                        investment relations free from the threat of sanctions or countervailing
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>Even if we could, it would probably be unwise to support the utopian
                        preconceptions behind the legalisms of “collective economic security”,
                        Echeverria’s Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States,<note n="6"

                            The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States was adopted by the
                            U.N. General Assembly (Resolution 3281 (XXIX)), December 12, 1974. For

                        developing your own insights on science and technology suggest a deeper lack
                        of practical flexibility in implementing even moderate and pragmatic
                        initiatives for coping with the economics of interdependence. Meanwhile, our
                        traditional bilateral economic and military assistance programs are
                        increasingly meager and irrelevant to Latin American needs.</p>
                    <p>Latin America’s weaknesses are just as apparent. Most hemisphere governments
                        are so beset with immediate domestic problems that few real energies remain
                        for anything else. Despite continuing institutional and economic growth,
                        elite disorganization and popular pressures have created an underlying
                        crisis of legitimacy and authority—in apparently stable countries like
                        Mexico as well as in more obviously troubled countries such as Argentina,
                        Uruguay and now Peru. The great dilemmas—migration and population growth,
                        income maldistribution, unfavorable terms of trade and investment—regularly
                        take a back seat to mundane emergencies over public services, gasoline
                        prices and obtaining the (mostly private) loans to meet growing import
                        bills.</p>
                    <p>Not surprisingly, therefore, the region’s foreign affairs—always ambiguous in
                        recent years—seem more difficult to categorize than ever. Everyone favors

                        the sea or Belize’s independence, between military governments and the few
                        persisting democracies—fester, but never seem to produce a major crisis.
                        Even Puerto Rico is becoming a long-term question mark.</p>
                    <p>Extra-hemispheric relationships are similarly in flux. The <gloss

                        Japan, is an increasingly important trading partner. Seen up close, other

                        The Soviet Union remains a source of danger—but offers occasional benefits.
                        Only China seems rather absent.</p>
                    <p>The one important generalization about the region’s foreign affairs, then, is
                        the one made earlier: most of its governments actively desire improved
                        relations with the United States. And their new pragmatism may actually test
                        our capacity for responsiveness more than did their previous unmeetable
                        demands. Despite the difficulties, therefore, there is reason for optimism.
                        The real short-term danger points are only two: Panama and human rights.

                        could severely damage inter-American relations. Human rights may be even
                        less controllable.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Human Rights Challenge</p>
                    <p>The tendency in several South American countries to fight terror with terror
                        has led to a rash of killings, disappearances, and similar acts against
                        “subversives”. Some of these acts are provoked by genuine threats, some are
                        not. Some are officially sanctioned, some not. The distinctions are
                        typically difficult. It is clear, however, that most of those targetted and
                        hit are not terrorists.</p>
                    <p>In Argentina, the new storm center, a conservative military government is
                        attempting to reestablish order after a period of uncontrolled proliferation
                        of terrorist and counter-terrorist armies. International acceptance of the
                        legitimacy of its efforts has been severely damaged by reports of
                        indiscriminate “counter-terrorist operations”, some of which have been
                        carried out with anti-Semitic fury by defiant local Nazis, apparently with
                        police connections and even some official tolerance.</p>
                    <p>The resulting climate of insecurity and outrage—more abuses are to come—could
                        wreak havoc on attempts to consolidate improved relations, not just with
                        Argentina, but throughout Latin America. “Operation Condor”, the
                        semi-secret, officially coordinated counter-terrorism effort involves five
                        countries in addition to Argentina: Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, and,
                        significantly, Brazil. Because the governments concerned are all
                        military-dominated and hence by definition illegitimate in some eyes, the
                        human rights issue is stimulating a quasi-ideological reaction against
                        “reactionary military dictatorships” and even against Latin America as a
                        whole.</p>
                    <p>The result is that we are and will continue to be faced with a resurgence of
                        paternalism and anti-militarism in American attitudes toward Latin America,
                        combined with neo-isolationist anger at Latin America’s failure to follow a
                        course more compatible with American ideals. In fact, the combined force of
                        cultural attitudes, Congressional pressures, and bureaucratic habits are
                        already pushing us toward general condemnations and denials of multilateral
                        as well as bilateral assistance. The harbinger is clearly present in the
                        Harkin Amendment, which requires us to vote against <gloss target="#t_IDB_1"
                            >IDB</gloss> loans to countries where there is a “consistent pattern of

                        Furthermore, the only exception allowable under Harkin, that “such
                        assistance directly benefit the needy”, reveals assumptions about the <pb

                        politics in general that will rarely prove congruent with the requirements
                        of relations with the increasingly complex societies and governments to our
                        South.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Does it Matter?</p>
                    <p>Would even a worst-case scenario—in which some if not most Latin American
                        countries wound up in defiant confrontation with the international
                        community—make any measurable difference to the United States?</p>
                    <p>The answer, unfortunately, is yes. If South America were to become isolated,
                        it would be heavily at our expense, morally and politically. The swing of
                        the pendulum to the political right in Latin America—even the
                        counter-terrorism campaigns in the Southern Cone—are being justified partly
                        in the name of the West in general, and of the United States in particular.
                        The failures that could lead to international opprobrium—and internal
                        radicalization—would be listed—however unfairly—as <hi rend="italic"
                            >our</hi> failures. And in the meantime, other powers with fewer
                        inhibitions would position themselves to advantage. The Soviet Union has
                        kept a low profile in Latin America recently, but its willingness to heavily
                        subsidize military sales to Peru demonstrates its capacity to take advantage
                        of our inflexibilities.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, because we and the Latin Americans both stand to lose a great
                        deal economically as well as politically, alienated interdependence is
                        ultimately more likely than complete isolation. <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> direct investment is substantial. The exposure of commercial
                        banks is even greater. Private efforts to salvage these economic interests
                        would predictably outlast public patience, thereby just as predictably
                        stimulating political controversies of the kind that already dog us with
                        South Africa.</p>
                    <p>There is a more immediate problem as well: the human rights issue threatens
                        to subject most if not all our bilateral and multilateral relations to
                        unenforceable standards. We have been through this before—on both economic
                        and military assistance. The pattern is now being repeated on Human Rights.
                        Our inability to explain or control Latin American conditions leads first to
                        criticism of the executive, then to Congressional restrictions, and finally
                        to an apparent <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> unwillingness to
                        cooperate.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the stakes are sufficient to
                        warrant concern, and that some sort of continuing engagement is
                        inevitable.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">What Can we Do About It?</p>
                    <p>To argue that our relationships with Latin America are too manifold and
                        intimate to escape is of course nothing new. It is in many ways <pb n="465"
                            facs="0496" xml:id="pg_465"/>what you have yourself been arguing for
                        three years: we need new ways to manage our interdependence, in this
                        hemisphere as elsewhere. And the agenda is so vast that no single problem
                        should be allowed to dominate relations, just as no single policy formula
                        can encompass the full range of relations between the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and the varied societies of Latin
                        America.</p>
                    <p>The limits on our flexibility are increasingly clear, however. There is
                        precious little constituency in Congress for political realism towards Latin
                        America. Support for even modest military programs has been dwindling
                        steadily. And unless conditions improve noticeably in Argentina and Chile,
                        nothing we can say will turn Congress around on human rights. Chile is not
                        Iran or Korea—witness the unusual ban on even commercial arms sales.</p>
                    <p>This paper cannot attempt to lay out a detailed strategy on the human rights
                        issue. But the basic requirement seems clear. Faced with the intractable
                        realities of human rights, we have little choice but to develop forms of
                        engagement that tolerate both cooperation and criticism. At Tlatelolco,
                        faced with Latin American complaints about “<gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> economic sanctions”, you responded that such measures could
                        be overcome only through development of more cooperative and mutually
                        responsive relations: new “rules of the game”.<note n="9" xml:id="d82fn9">In

                            heelaborated on his idea of a “New Dialogue” between the United States
                            and Latin America, which he first put forward in 1973 (see <ref

                        But the course of our relations since then also suggests that accommodations
                        can frequently be worked out in practice. To do so we will need to
                        demonstrate:</p>
                    <p>—to the American public and Congress, that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> government considers human rights one of several interests
                        we seek to promote with balance and vision—but that it would be
                        self-defeating to allow it to override all others; and</p>
                    <p>—to Latin America, that our commitments are practical and not abstract, that
                        they involve cooperation as well as preaching.</p>
                    <p>Your two Latin American trips this year have set forth the elements of such a
                        policy—of cooperation for development as well as for security, to advance
                        human rights as well as economic progress. To lessen the disruptive impact
                        of the growing storm over human rights, we will need to articulate this
                        approach more fully in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of its dimensions. By
                        showing sympathy for the victims and giving practical support to
                        institutions that promote human dignity and the rule of law, we <pb n="466"
                            facs="0497" xml:id="pg_466"/>can make clear our rejection of acts
                        contrary to civilized values. By expanding trade and increasing the flow of
                        technology and people—and working pragmatically to resolve the problems they
                        create—we can increase mutually profitable cooperation and perhaps even
                        alleviate some of the insecurities and poverty that contribute to abuses. We
                        can do little more—and should probably do no less.</p>
                    <p>Two and a half years ago, on the eve of Tlatelolco, Mexican Foreign Minister
                        Rabasa urged that the most important single thing you could do would be to
                        declare publicly that there would be “No More Santo Domingos”. Today, after
                        new “revelations” about Chile (and the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                        in general), some Latin Americans still talk about <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> “destabilization” plots. But those who take such talk
                        seriously are probably fewer today than at any time since the early 1950’s.
                        We have in fact succeeded in demonstrating our commitment to mutual
                        accommodation rather than unilateral intervention.</p>
                    <p>It was thus not accidental that human rights could be discussed
                        constructively at the <gloss target="#t_OASGA_1">OASGA</gloss>. Because we
                        had quieted fears of intervention, we could afford to make our views on
                        human rights known. We can continue to do so, so long as we distinguish
                        among conditions, countries and policy instruments, using more
                        discrimination, specificity and perhaps even compassion than either we or
                        Congress have routinely shown in the past.</p>
                    <p>The executive, not Congress, should set policy on human rights. Latin
                        American governments should be made aware that we do not condone certain
                        practices even if we cannot force their complete control or elimination. And
                        Congress should be reminded that we have important national interests to
                        promote in addition to human rights, that attempts to enforce explicit
                        standards on other societies frequently have undesirable side effects, even
                        that the visa, immigration and refugee policies Congress largely controls
                        sometimes set a poor example of openness and respect for political rights.
                        The watchwords are similar for both audiences: cooperation, not imposition
                        or withdrawal; discrimination, not frustrated overreaction.</p>

                        say that. Now <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> is going in

                    <p>President: I will say: What is more moral than peace? What is more moral than
                        bringing peace in the Middle East? What is more moral than what we’re doing
                        in Southern Africa? There are about five things.</p>

                        frequently. That makes you look weak, as if we compete. You should look

                        have any complaints they should convey them to the United States Government,
                        not to a private citizen. If he says the Chinese say we are weak on the
                        Soviets, I would say China can’t tell us how to conduct our policy just like
                        the Soviets can’t. The Chinese would like us to be in confrontation with the
                        Soviet Union to take their chestnuts out of the fire.</p>

                    <p>I said yesterday to the editorial writers we have to preserve peace both by
                        strength and by conciliation.</p>
                    <p>If he hits generally on being weak on the Soviets, point out his positions.
                        He wants to cut the defense budget, prevent our giving military aid to Kenya
                        and Zaire, withdraw from Korea, and let Communists into European
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>I would say there have been two Democratic administrations since World War II
                        and we have gotten into two wars; we’ve had two Republican Administrations
                        and got into no war.</p>
                    <p>I honestly believe that is no accident. They extend our commitments and
                        reduce our strength. Do you have these statements on Communists in Italy? I
                        would not defend the soft on Soviets charge. I would attack him for making
                        it.</p>

                            and occupying most of the countries there and making sure with their

                                >Ford</persName> responded: “I don’t believe, Mr. Frankel, that the

                            believe that the Romanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet
                            Union. I don’t believe the Poles consider themselves dominated by the
                            Soviet Union. Each of those countries is independent, autonomous; it has
                            its own territorial integrity. And the United States does not concede
                            that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.” (<hi

                        to encourage a revolution? You have taken the responsible

                    <p>The greatest possibility for freedom in Eastern Europe is an easing of
                        tensions so they can maneuver. The worst situation for them is when the
                        Soviet Army is on their necks. You visited three countries in Eastern

                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Isn’t that dangerous?</p>
                    <pb n="471" facs="0502" xml:id="pg_471"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: On domestic policy yes,
                        foreign policy no. This is the man who wants to cut the budget, bring troops
                        home and advocate revolution in Eastern Europe. This is the way to get us
                        into war.</p>
                    <p>On Helsinki, the first point is there were 35 nations there, including the
                        Vatican, not just the United States. Second, when he says it recognizes
                        spheres of influence, it shows <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName>
                        doesn’t know what he is talking about. Helsinki says nothing about the
                        Soviet Union in Europe. It says that borders can’t be changed by force, but
                        only by peaceful means. To whose advantage is this? Ours or the Soviet
                        Union’s, with 70 divisions on the border? For the first time the Soviets
                        have committed themselves to implementing human rights. They’re not sticking
                        to it right now but it gives us a standard to which we can hold them.</p>
                    <p>I am getting worked up. But this guy really burns me. He is a super liberal
                        and now he is turning tough.</p>
                    <p>On grain, I don’t like this answer [in <persName corresp="#p_ELS_1"
                            >Eagleburger</persName>’s paper].<note n="12" xml:id="d83fn12">See <ref
                                target="#d83fn1">footnote 1</ref> above.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: He said we messed up the
                        grain deal in 1972. The implications are that he would use grain as a
                        weapon.</p>
                    <p>You will get a question on an oil embargo.</p>
                    <p>President: I will say we don’t expect one but we can work with them now to
                        work it out, unlike 1973.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The first part is okay
                        but on the second I would say we won’t accept an embargo, but I won’t
                        telegraph what I would do. Our policy is designed to avoid an embargo, but
                        we will certainly deal with it if it happens.</p>
                    <p>On nuclear proliferation, he again doesn’t know what he is talking about. We
                        organized the suppliers. You have a policy but you are waiting to announce
                        it until you have coordinated with our allies. <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                            >Carter</persName> would do it unilaterally and in fact against our
                        allies.</p>
                    <p>If you win this one, the third debate won’t matter.</p>
                    <p>On human rights: What has any Democratic Administration done for human rights
                        and when? We have brought Jewish emigration from 400 in 1968 to 35,000 in
                        1973 until Congress interfered. There is a difference: We believe in action,
                        not talk.</p>
                    <p>When he talks dictatorship, say it is easy to make declarations, but a
                        President has the responsibility for the security of the United States and
                        he must deal with the world as it is. It was the Democratic killing of
                            Diem<note n="13" xml:id="d83fn13">South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh
                            Diem was assassinated November 2, 1963, during a military coup.</note>
                        which got us sucked irrevocably into Vietnam. We are working <pb n="472"
                            facs="0503" xml:id="pg_472"/>on a practical basis; what <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJ_1">Carter</persName> proposes is either ineffective,
                        dangerous or both.</p>
                    <p>On intelligence. He says people have been assassinated. I would say most of
                        that was under the Democrats. Then I would say one of the most irresponsible
                        things ever done to our intelligence was done by a Democratic Congress.</p>
                    <p>President: They have talked and done not a goddamned thing. I put in the
                        changes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I would say there was a
                        reckless assault on intelligence by the Democratic Congress and you took
                        responsible action.</p>
                    <p>President: Did you say all assassinations?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Except for a little
                        planning under Ike.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If they bring Chile into
                        the assassination business I would say: read your own Church report.<note

                    <p>On the Middle East, I would say the Democrats had no relations with the key
                        Arab states. We have restored the balance and you are certainly not going to
                        play politics with so volatile and dangerous an area.</p>
                    <p>I don’t have an Israeli policy. I have an American policy. Say <persName
                            corresp="#p_RY_1">Rabin</persName> said our relations are at their
                        peak.</p>
                    <p>President: Can I say the key Arab states didn’t have relations with us?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely. I wouldn’t
                        use the actual amount of aid except if he does, to show he doesn’t know what
                        he is talking about.</p>
                    <p>President: I feel good about this one.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Here you can refute you
                        have no vision of the future. Say: I will bring peace.</p>
                    <p>On the Third World, I would start with the World Food Conference.</p>
                    <p>On Defense, I don’t know what <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                            >Schlesinger</persName> can have him do.</p>
                    <p>President: I am ready for him.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SBA_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Arms sales.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He is using the wrong
                        figures. He is saying $7.5 billion for the Saudis. Over $6 billion of that
                        is for barracks, etc. I would hit him on it.</p>
                    <p>The biggest sales go to Israel and Iran, two countries who have made a big
                        contribution to stability in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>What is the threat to Iran? The Soviet Union, Iraq. The threat to Iran is
                        from countries we would also consider a threat. Iran refused to <pb n="473"
                            facs="0504" xml:id="pg_473"/>impose an embargo in 1973—even on Israel.
                            <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> threatened the Soviet
                        Union on Iran’s behalf in 1946.</p>
                    <p>Giving arms doesn’t get us involved; not giving them would get us involved
                        because their weakness would invite aggression and we would have to go in to
                        bail them out.</p>
                    <p>The third category of aid goes to countries like Kenya and Zaire who have
                        Soviet-equipped neighbors.</p>
                    <p>Most of the aid goes to Israel, Iran, and Saudi Arabia—for
                        infrastructure—leaving only bits and pieces for the rest of the world.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, I really
                        do not know whether on my last day in office I am in the best position to
                        evaluate. Just before I came here I wrote an article in which I said the
                        world is bipolar militarily, multipolar politically, and fragmented
                        economically. When you talk of world order now you have to take account of
                        each of these realities and also the fact that probably history will record
                        this as one of the philosophical revolutions of history.</p>
                    <p>In the nature of things, this task could not have been completed—even without
                        Watergate. That is the basic thing. I think in one way or another the
                        relationship between China, the Soviet Union, the indus<pb n="474"
                            facs="0505" xml:id="pg_474"/>trial democracies, the United States, and
                        the developing world—this five-sided aspect—is a permanent feature of the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>I think that in our relations with the industrial democracies, what I
                        proposed in 1973 has been more or less accomplished. The method I chose as a
                        formal declaration turned out not to be the right one, but the reality is
                        that now the industrial democracies talk not just about their military
                        security but their political and economic future has been achieved.</p>
                    <p>Now, this has to be strengthened, because if the cohesion can be increased,
                        then both the dialogue with the East and the dialogue with the South can be
                        conducted with enormous confidence.</p>
                    <p>We, the industrial democracies, transfer 90 percent of all the real resources
                        that go to the developing world, so if we can develop a unified approach we,
                        and only we, can make a significant contribution to development.</p>
                    <p>In the East-West dialogue I refuse to be mesmerized by Soviet strength. It is
                        real, but there are also real weaknesses, and I think a combination of
                        diplomacy, negotiation, and strength can keep this in check.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">When you look back on this do you look back with pride,
                            with sadness, anger, or what?</hi>

                        think if you compare the world report in 1969 with the world today, you must

                        On the other hand, I look back with sadness because of the anguish that the
                        country suffered during this period, the bitterness of the debate on
                        Vietnam, in the disintegration of authority on the Watergate, the
                        destruction of some people I knew, and in the sense of things that one would
                        have liked to accomplish and didn’t quite finish.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, I would
                        have liked to have finished the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think it was
                        partly the other side, partly the election, and partly internal disputes
                        within the Administration.</p>

                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">How do you feel about the future of Western
                            civilization?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think the West
                        has material strength to deal with all of its problems. It has the resources
                        to deal with a North-South dialogue; it has the capacity, militarily, to
                        prevent aggression; and it has the ability to conduct an effective
                        diplomacy. What it needs is imagination, dedication, and a view of the
                        future. I believe that is attainable.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">Do you think the prospects are better now than they were
                            two years ago?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, because we
                        have gotten through Watergate and because we have made great progress in
                        strengthening the dialogue with the industrial democracies, because unless
                        the free peoples live together, we will not be able to solve either the
                        East-West or North-South problem.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">When you look back, what are the four or five moments
                            that you think about with most pride? Are there some things that come to
                            your mind immediately?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course
                        landing in China was a tremendous experience. When <persName
                            corresp="#p_LDT_1">Le Duc Tho</persName> put on the table the proposal
                        which I knew would end the Vietnamese war, that was a tremendous feeling
                        because I thought, not knowing that Watergate was coming, that it would
                        unify the American people again, which, if you look at my press briefings
                        between 1969 and 1973, was my overwhelming concern; the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement; the signing of the Shanghai
                        communiqué; the first disengagement agreement between the Egyptians and
                        Israel; and strangely enough, the first Rambouillet summit, because it meant
                        that at least we were beginning to pull the industrial democracies together.
                        Finally, I was terribly moved when President Kaunda got up at the end of my
                        Lusaka speech and embraced me. I thought that was a moving occasion.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">The African diplomacy that you put so much effort into
                            last year, has it sort of stalled and fizzled out because of the
                            elections?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, I think
                        the elections slowed it down because all of the participants are waiting to
                        see what the new Administration is going to do and to see whether the terms
                        of reference can be changed. But I think once Smith [<persName
                            corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian D. Smith</persName>, of Rhodesia] made his basic
                        speech the course was set for settlement.</p>
                    <p>I cannot tell you what the exact terms will be, but those are not as
                        fundamental as the fact that Smith is committed to majority rule.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">What were your nightmares during this period?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: One nightmare
                        that I am sure my successors will have as well is to make sure that some
                        crisis does not escalate into nuclear war and that unthinkingly we
                        contribute to a massive conflagration.</p>
                    <pb n="476" facs="0507" xml:id="pg_476"/>
                    <p>The second nightmare was that the Vietnam war would so split our country that
                        reconciliation would be totally impossible. That was immediately followed by
                        the nightmare of preventing the collapse of executive authority from leading
                        to foreign challenge, of managing a major crisis in the Middle East when our
                        own executive authority was under assault.</p>
                    <p>In the last period my nightmare was that America might become so absorbed
                        with itself and so purist and so critical of itself that it would forget
                        that it is the key element for security, progress, and freedom in the world.
                        I think all of these nightmares are on the way to being solved.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">And the agenda for the rest of 1977?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think for 1977
                        we have some rather positive prospects. I think in 1977 a <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement ought to be attainable. The
                        objective conditions for making progress in the Middle East are better than
                        they have been probably at any time since the creation of Israel.</p>
                    <p>I do not want to put my successor on the spot by pretending it will be easy.
                        It will be a murderously difficult, complicated effort. All I am saying is
                        the conditions exist for a heroic effort.</p>
                    <p>I think we can make a breakthrough on law of the seas this year. I think we
                        have already made major progress, and we can consolidate and extend it, on
                        nonproliferation. I think we can carry the Rhodesian and Namibian matters to
                        a conclusion this year. I do not see any overwhelming crises in 1977 unless
                        things in Africa get totally out of control, but I don’t really expect
                        that.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Panama is
                        another matter that I think will be settled this year.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">You were talking earlier about getting together with the
                            industrial democracies. What about energy supplies and our relations

                            because of the Saudi decision on prices, but we really have not settled
                            that problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">At the meeting of <gloss

                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: On energy we
                        created the International Energy Agency, which I believe is an extremely
                        useful institution. We have worked out within it a common policy to prevent
                        selective embargoes and to obligate industrial democracies to support each
                        other. It has a good program for developing alternative sources and for
                        conservation. The missing link has been the refusal of the United States to
                        implement what this program foresees in the area of alternative sources, <pb
                            n="477" facs="0508" xml:id="pg_477"/>of conservation, and since we
                        consume 40 percent of the energy of the industrial democracies we can write
                        whatever plan we want, but unless we implement it, it will not really
                        help.</p>
                    <p>We must work to prevent a situation from continuing where every six months or
                        a year the West waits impotently while a group of nations that do not have
                        identical interests decides about its economic future.</p>
                    <p>We got through the last <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> [Organization
                        of Petroleum Exporting Countries] meeting, but unless we have changed the
                        objective conditions in which energy is being dealt with, we will face the
                        same problem again. The key is for the nations that are assembled in the
                        International Energy Agency to develop a major program of alternative
                        sources, a significant program of conservation, and to use all other
                        political tools to encourage restraint among the oil producers. Otherwise,
                        as you look four or five years ahead, it is frivolous to assume that
                        sometimes decisions will not be taken that could be potentially catastrophic
                        for our economy.</p>
                    <p>We were lucky this year, or skillful or able, but you cannot do it every
                        year.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">Would you agree that until very recently the perception
                            of other countries, particularly in the Third World, was that this
                            country and its leadership did not care much about their problems?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is forgotten
                        today that until the end of 1972 we were heavily preoccupied with the war in
                        Vietnam and with the relationships it took to extricate ourselves. For
                        example—putting aside the Third World for a moment—we could not really make
                        great progress in relations with Western Europe as long as in every Western
                        European country the issue of Vietnam was an inhibition to closer relations
                        with the United States. So the war had to be ended first. I think it is true
                        that until 1973 we did not give it systematic major attention.</p>
                    <p>From the end of 1973 on, and in the last three years, I think the Third World
                        has been a focal point, and if you look at the agenda of these discussions
                        in food, in financing, and in the development and the transfer of
                        technology, the entire international agenda was put forward by us. There is
                        almost no other agenda.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">Is there any validity to the argument that essentially
                            what this record is that you have left here is essentially a brilliant

                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, I am not
                        the best judge of this; but I have to say that I pass on a world that is at
                        peace, more at peace than in any previous transition, in which, in addition,
                        in every problem area solutions can be foreseen even if they have not been
                        fully achieved and the framework for solutions exist, in which the agenda of
                        most interna<pb n="478" facs="0509" xml:id="pg_478"/>tional negotiations was
                        put forward by the United States. Therefore it cannot be entirely an
                        accident, and it cannot be a series of tactical improvisations.</p>
                    <p>I think it would be more useful to debate the nature of the design than to
                        deny that there has been a design. The denial shows lack of understanding of
                        the nature of foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>The surface expression of our Middle East policy was shuttle diplomacy, but
                        the conditions that made shuttle diplomacy possible were created over four
                        years of a rather painful accumulation of new answers. There may be some
                        people who remember an interview I gave in 1970 in which I said what our
                        strategy would be in the Middle East and people laughed about it.<note n="4"

                        So I think there has been a design, and my associates will certainly confirm
                        that whenever a problem came up we would spend hours here every morning
                        before we went into any tactics trying to figure out where this thing should
                        go. So I disagree with that.</p>
                    <p>We would almost never accept here a discussion of a tactical move without
                        accompanying description of what the implications were over a considerable
                        period of time.</p>
                    <p>When you take the Lusaka speech,<note n="5" xml:id="d84fn5">

                        analyzing where we should try to go in Africa and how we could balance our
                        concern for majority rule with our equally strong concern to prevent the
                        radicalization of all of Africa, and it was not simply a tactical device to
                        get through a few weeks’ period. In fact there was no demand for it at
                        all.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think it is a
                        mistake to define the Sino-Soviet relationships in terms of our exploiting
                        their differences. Their differences came about without our comprehending it
                        at the time. We did not create them; we cannot exploit them; we can only
                        base our policy on the fact that China is doing us no favor, is not opposing
                        Soviet hegemony as a favor to us; and therefore we have to understand the
                        fundamental trends that affect these countries.</p>
                    <p>I believe it is important that the People’s Republic of China continue to
                        perceive us as interested in maintaining a world equilibrium. If they feel
                        we have lost our interest in it or our comprehension of it or our
                        willingness to preserve it, then they will draw the inevitable conclu<pb
                            n="479" facs="0510" xml:id="pg_479"/>sion, which will be to make
                        whatever accommodation they can get, or they will try to find some other
                        means of protection, such as organizing the Third World against both of
                        us.</p>
                    <p>You can take either one of those courses. I believe that of course the Soviet
                        Union is a superpower and as such impinges on us in many parts of the world.
                        It is a growing military power that in many respects has the capacity to
                        threaten our survival.</p>
                    <p>I believe, however, that the military problem is soluble. I believe the
                        Soviet Union as a system is beset by tremendous weaknesses. There is no
                        Communist state in the world that has managed to achieve spontaneous support
                        of its population.</p>
                    <p>The states of Eastern Europe have to appeal to a sort of bourgeois
                        nationalism to maintain a modicum of legitimacy; and to imagine that
                        societies that are doing well in certain high-priority areas of military
                        technical knowledge but that have never solved effectively the problem of
                        distribution and of even simple administration, that those societies can
                        launch themselves on an indeterminate course of world domination without
                        grave hesitation, seems to me unrealistic.</p>
                    <p>Yes, we have to build up enough military forces to resist them, but we have
                        to know what forces are relevant. I believe that to achieve a usable
                        military superiority in the field of strategic nuclear weapons is extremely
                        unlikely and relatively easy to prevent and the obsession with it detracts
                        us. I would say that if there is a conflict between the Soviet Union and us,
                        it is much less likely to occur as a result of a Soviet attack, deliberate
                        attack, on a vital interest of the United States than as a result of a
                        conflict that maybe neither of us saw, into which we are drawn through a
                        series of escalating moves.</p>
                    <p>In other words, I think World War I is a better guide to our dangers than
                        World War II.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">In retrospect, should we have gotten into major economic
                            deals with the Russians?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The curious
                        thing is that when we came in in 1969 we developed the theory of linkage.
                        The theory of linkage was that the Soviet Union would get economic
                        concessions in return for political stabilization. At that time we were
                        criticized because we were told that we should simply go ahead with the
                        economic programs because they were produced as political stabilizers.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">Is it possible for our people to achieve the kind of
                            security that they would like to have without creating such a sense of
                            insecurity in the minds of our adversaries as to be dangerous to the
                            world?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think it is
                        the essence of the new circumstances I have described that no nation can
                        achieve absolute security. Absolute security for one nation means absolute
                        insecurity for all na<pb n="480" facs="0511" xml:id="pg_480"/>tions. We have
                        to be satisfied now with relative security, with security that makes it
                        extremely improbable that our vital interests are threatened but still one
                        that is not totally predominant in the world.</p>
                    <p>The first time we gave a credit to the Soviet Union was after the Berlin
                        agreement of 1971, and I would say without exception all the economic
                        agreements we made with the Soviet Union were parallel to some political
                        agreement. All of our economic agreements were tied to specific projects. We
                        did not give general unrestricted credit, and the total amount was something
                        like $400 million. As a result of our own domestic debate, in effect a
                        freeze was put on this evolution. The truth of this has been that the
                        Europeans and Japanese have given about $10 billion of unrestricted credit
                        to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Europeans and Japanese are in a much worse situation than we to insist on
                        a political quid pro quo, and I have always fully believed that economic
                        programs allied to specific political foreign projects create the
                        possibility first of making specific foreign policy agreements, and,
                        secondly, creating incentives for cooperation, incentives for restraint.</p>
                    <p>If you think of some of these projects that would take 15 years to implement
                        before there would be any return and if you think of the fact that in 15
                        years other powers would have risen that would take some of the load of
                        containing the military threat, that is not something that one should simply
                        ignore.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">What about a link with force reduction talks in
                            Vienna?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, I do not
                        want to prescribe to the new Administration what they should link it to, but
                        they will find enough things to link it to if they analyze the situation.
                        No, it is not dead, and I think Berlin should be actively pursued.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">If you were carrying on, is that something you would
                            link, large-scale economic involvement, yourself?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t know
                        whether I would link it above all the restraints in peripheral areas.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">“Absolute security for one nation is absolute insecurity
                            for other nations.” Would you use that principle in the Middle East as
                            well as in a strategic relationship?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The problem in
                        the Middle East is to balance physical security against legitimacy. There is
                        no question that Israel’s physical security is best guaranteed by the widest
                        extension of its frontier and at no other point are they as physically
                        secure as at the maximum point of their extension.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, politically and in the long term, they may be militarily
                        even less secure if they do not achieve legitimacy. Now, how to balance
                        these factors is the dilemma of the Middle East settlement.</p>
                    <pb n="481" facs="0512" xml:id="pg_481"/>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">How can our aid to Israel be balanced?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I believe that
                        Israel must have a sense of security in the military field or it cannot
                        negotiate effectively and we must not, in attempting to press for a
                        settlement, break the spirit of Israel and its ability to defend itself.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">Let me ask you—I want to be personal because it is not
                            just a tour of the horizon we are doing here, it is you who is leaving.
                            What has this experience done to you?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is going to
                        be quite a sight when they carry me out at noon on the 20th, like Sewell

                        may be the only way they will get me out of here.</p>
                    <p>Q. <hi rend="italic">Seriously, what did it do to you?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Again, I am sure
                        I will be more thoughtful about that two months from now than now. I have
                        said repeatedly, maybe too often in recent days, that the quality that most
                        outsiders do not understand is the athletic aspect of decision-making so
                        that you really have to react in very short timeframes that do not permit
                        time for reflection.</p>
                    <p>I think I have developed great compassion for my successors. I do not think
                        you can leave this office—before I came to Washington I thought it was very
                        thrilling to be called down here as a consultant and I thought it was
                        important for me to pick on the incumbents and for all I know I may wind up
                        doing that. I have my doubts now on the utility of outsiders—I am sure I
                        will do my utmost to avoid volunteering advice to my successors.</p>
                    <p>I really think what this country needs now is a period of tranquillity and
                        confidence and that those of us who have seen this process have an
                        obligation to help build that confidence. That is what I would most like to
                        do.</p>
