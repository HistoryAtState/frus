                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts that contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series is
                    edited by the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of
                    State. The editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in
                    accordance with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary
                    of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925:</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating the place
                    in the text where the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of
                    major importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose
                    of concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons:</p>
                <list>
                    <label>a.</label>
                    <item>To avoid publication of matters that would tend to impede current
                        diplomatic negotiations or other business.</item>
                    <label>b.</label>
                    <item>To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless details.</item>
                    <label>c.</label>
                    <item>To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by individuals and by
                        foreign governments.</item>
                    <label>d.</label>
                    <item>To avoid giving needless offense to other nationalities or

                    <label>e.</label>
                    <item>To eliminate personal opinions presented in despatches and not acted upon
                        by the Department. To this consideration there is one qualification: in
                        connection with major decisions it is desirable, where possible, to show the
                        alternative presented to the Department before the decision was made.</item>

                <p>In planning the overall scope of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes for the 1955–1957 triennium, the editors chose to present the
                    documentation on U.S. policy in East Asia in four separate volumes. Volume I is
                    devoted entirely to the record of U.S. policy toward the civil war in Vietnam.
                        <ref target="frus1955-57v21">Volume XXI</ref> presents the record of general
                    U.S. policy toward East Asian security, including the Southeast Asia Treaty
                    Association, and U.S. relations with Laos and Cambodia. <ref

                        target="frus1955-57v23p1">Volume XXIII</ref> will be published in two parts;
                    Part 2 covering U.S. relations with Korea will be published at a later date.</p>
                <p>This volume, which was initially compiled in 1979, is intended to document major
                    steps in the formulation of U.S. policies toward Japan and main issues in U.S.
                    relations with the Japanese Government. The editors focused on documenting U.S.
                    interest in maintaining its security relationship with Japan; U.S.-Japan
                    relationships in military matters, particularly the financing, status, and
                    behavior of U.S. troops in Japan; U.S. concerns regarding the Soviet-Japanese
                    peace treaty negotiations; U.S. interest in the economic future of Japan; and
                    U.S. policy with respect to the Bonin and Ryukyu islands.</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> was frequently
                    personally involved in the formulation of U.S. policy toward Japan. The editors
                    made the most careful effort to utilize all materials available in the <persName
                        corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName> Presidential Library,
                    including the memoranda of discussion at National Security Council meetings and
                    other institutional <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> documents included in
                    the Library’s Whitman File. Documents from the Eisenhower Library constitute a
                    major portion of the materials printed in this volume.</p>
                <p>The Department of State and the Embassy in Tokyo played continuous and important
                    roles in the policy process. Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John
                        Foster Dulles</persName> made policy recommendations to the President, and
                    he made significant decisions within the lines of established policies. He took
                    a leading role in such matters as U.S. policy regarding the Soviet-Japanese
                    peace treaty negotiations and the renegotiation of the U.S.-Japan Security
                    Treaty. The Embassy made important recommendations regarding all the leading
                    issues in U.S.-Japan relations, at times bringing about modifications of
                    policies formulated in Washington.</p>
                <p>The editors had complete access to all Department of State files including the
                    central decimal files, the special subfiles of the Executive Secretariat, the
                    various decentralized (lot) files originally maintained at <pb n="V"
                        xml:id="pg_V" facs="0009"/>the Bureau, office, or division level, and the
                    Embassy files as retired to the Washington National Records Center of the
                    National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were closely involved in
                    such issues as the determination of the balance between U.S. and Japanese
                    funding of U.S. forces in Japan, questions of criminal jurisdiction such as the
                    Girard case, the U.S. attitude toward the pace and character of Japanese
                    rearmament, and modification of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The editors had
                    access to the records of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (International
                    Security Affairs), declassified files of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the
                    National Archives and Records Administration, other specified files of the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff as agreed upon request, and cable files at the U.S. Army
                    Military History Institute.</p>
                <p>The editors did not attempt to document U.S. intelligence operations or any
                    significant relationship between foreign policy and intelligence. At the time
                    this volume was prepared, limitations on access by official historians to
                    relevant records made such research impractical. The editors did have access to
                    National Intelligence Estimates and Special National Intelligence Estimates in
                    the files of the Department of State’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research and
                    to the important intelligence documents at the Eisenhower Library, and some key
                    intelligence analyses that contributed to major political or diplomatic actions
                    are included in the volume.</p>
                <p>Procedures for expanded access by Department historians to the records of the
                    Central Intelligence Agency were being developed at the time this volume was
                    ready for publication. The Department of State was not prepared to delay the
                    publication of this volume pending the outcome of those developments, but does
                    intend to release in subsequent publications of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series, or in some other manner, significant declassified
                    documentation obtained from the Central Intelligence Agency files.</p>
                <p>A listing of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume is on pages
                    XI–XV.</p>
                <p>The editors of the volume are confident that the documentation presented here
                    accurately illuminates the main lines of U.S. policy toward Japan in 1955–1957.
                    The declassification review process, outlined in more detail below, resulted in
                    the withholding of about 9 percent of the material originally proposed for
                    inclusion in this volume because the requirements of national security
                    necessitated its continued classification and protection.</p>
                <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0010"/>
                <p>The editors wish to acknowledge the assistance of officials at the <persName

                    particular David Haight; the National Archives and Records Administration; the
                    Department of Defense; and other specialized repositories who assisted in the
                    collection of documents for this volume.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Incoming telegrams from U.S. missions are placed according to time of receipt in
                    the Department of State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of
                    transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the Editor in Chief and the chief technical editor. The source
                    text is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other
                    notations, which are described in the footnotes. Obvious typographical errors
                    are corrected, but other mistakes and omissions in the source text are corrected
                    by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an omission in
                    roman type. Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate text that has been
                    omitted because it deals with an unrelated subject (in roman type) or because it
                    remained classified after the declassification review process (in italic type).
                    The amount of material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of source text that were omitted. All ellipses and brackets
                    that appear in the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source footnote also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President and/or his major policy advisers read it. Every effort has been made
                    to determine if a document has been previously published and this information
                    has been included in the source footnote. If two or more different accounts of a
                    meeting or event are available and one or more is already declassified and
                    published, the editors chose to print the still unpublished one and obtain its
                    declassification.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in this volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and summarize and provide citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when applicable to
                    supplement the official record.</p>

                <p>Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and
                    functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of the
                    U.S. Government, and appropriate foreign governments regarding documents of
                    those governments. The principle guiding declassification review is to release
                    as much information as is consistent with contemporary requirements of national
                    security and sound foreign relations.</p>

                                for this volume was the indexed central files of the Department of

                            accompanied by <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">General Hull</persName> and
                            me, Foreign Minister took occasion to emphasize in strongest possible
                            manner his belief that “fundamental basis” of Japanese policy was close
                            and friendly cooperation with US.</p>
                        <p>In spite of press stories that <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> has requested $45 million reduction in
                            Japanese contribution to United States forces in Japan, fact is that no
                            figure of any sort was mentioned, that no request for reduction was made
                            and that question of defense budget was not mentioned by Foreign
                            Minister until brought up by me. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> then contented himself with saying this was
                            complicated matter which he was certain could be satisfactorily settled
                            as result of discussion among ourselves and our experts.</p>
                        <p>There was some general discussion on reparations problem and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> expressed belief that was one
                            of most important problems to be solved before Japan could do its proper
                            share in general economic buildup of Asia. He pled for United States
                            consideration of this problem not as separate bilateral problem between
                            Japan and Philippines and Indonesia but as part of overall Far Eastern
                            economic problem. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said
                            he was not asking for any direct United States aid but that Japan would
                            welcome advice from American experts and hoped they would concern
                            themselves with the matter.</p>

                        <p>Only two specific matters were mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> and one of these, return of Japanese to
                            Bonins, was not pursued at any length. Foreign Minister did make lengthy
                            “personal appeal” on behalf of release of war criminals. This is subject
                            of increasing importance in Japan and <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> expressed deep regret that Great Britain and
                            United States, two best friends of Japan, continued to take what he
                            described as “legalistic” approach to problem. He said he did not
                            question legality of trials or correctness of decisions reached but ten
                            years had passed and it is important to forget past and do everything
                            possible heal wounds war. Continued incarceration of these men keeps
                            alive war resentments, hinders full and complete collaboration between
                            our two nations which is so essential and plays into hands of leftists
                            and Communists who point to releases being made by Communist China and
                            Soviets. It is not good to point to thousands Communists have not and
                            never will release, important thing is that considerable talk and some
                            action is evident from Communist side leading to releases. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> requested <persName

                        <p>In my personal opinion which I know is shared by <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">General Hull</persName>, there is little which we
                            could do in Japan which would do more good for American-Japan relations
                            than a decision for early release, on parole or otherwise, of remaining
                            war criminals under United States jurisdiction.</p>

                                        Japan which is politically, economically and militarily
                                        strong, which is allied closely with the US and which is
                                        capable of exerting dynamic anti-Communist leadership in
                                        Asia. Military strength is an essential and integral part of
                                        total Japanese strength since no nation confronted with a
                                        constant and serious threat of aggression can be a great
                                        nation if it is incapable of defending itself. Moreover, the
                                        political and economic objectives can and should be achieved
                                        without retarding the rate of development of the military
                                        forces of Japan.</item>

                                        There is a growing tendency among the Japanese to
                                        participate in flights from reality which lead them to
                                        entertain hopes of neutralism and of prosperous coexistence
                                        with both the East and the West. These obstacles serve to
                                        increase the challenge placed on US policy and, for the best
                                        interests of the US, should be overcome.</item>

                                        to the US now as it has ever been in the past. Japan is

                                        toward Japan must encourage and reward the Japanese people
                                        in their development of inherent Japanese strengths. These
                                        strengths must include political and economic as well as
                                        military strength with no one element of strength being
                                        advanced at the expense of the others. US policy must, as a
                                        principal measure, assist in the generation of a strong

                                        United States. These strengths in the Japanese society must
                                        be derived from substantial Japanese accomplishments in
                                        endeavors looking toward improving the will and capacity of

                                objectives in Japan in part one of reference message although I
                                believe it is cast in too strictly military terms. Our goal here
                                should be development of strong Japan and harnessing of its strength
                                to free world’s effort to thwart Communist threat. Considering
                                Japanese achievements in pre-war period, there can be little
                                question of its capabilities for becoming important power in Far
                                East. Nevertheless, it <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0035"/>is also
                                evident that limited resources do not permit rapid progress toward
                                achievement of economic and military strength. Problem facing US
                                policy is therefore how we best contribute to hastening Japanese
                                achievement of strength and at same time assure that Japan, once
                                strong, will not move towards Soviet orbit or adopt such strictly
                                neutralist policies as would limit its aid to Western efforts
                                against Communist aggression. In considering our short-term
                                policies, I do not believe we should lose sight of fact that
                                Japanese recovery of power is likely be long-term task. Stake in
                                Japan far too great to risk unnecessarily substantial eventual
                                contribution to free world effort by seeking momentary gains.</item>

                            <item>Principal present obstacle to immediate emphasis on recovery of
                                Japanese military strength lies not in capabilities to undertake
                                more extensive defense effort but in unwillingness of Japanese
                                Government at present to utilize this potential due to political
                                reasons based on social and economic requirements pointed out

                                support costs lies in reaffirmation by Hatoyama Government of

                                Government. While elements in Japanese Government, particularly
                                Defense Agency, for larger defense program, policy of present
                                government is to resist additional defense efforts at this time and
                                concentrate instead on developing Japanese economy and increasing
                                receptiveness of Japanese people to subsequent major defense
                                efforts. Privately, major figures in conservative movement admit
                                need for far greater defense efforts. However, they are unwilling
                                undertake such program before political situation stabilized by
                                unity of conservative political forces, economic conditions
                                improved, and national spirit rehabilitated thus making climate of
                                opinion more favorable. Until then Japanese Government willing
                                depend largely on US and make only token annual increases in
                                Japanese forces. After political and economic stabilization
                                achieved, innate compulsions of Japanese to exercise influential
                                role as major power will probably lead to more substantial defense
                                program since military strength is prerequisite for power. For
                                present, however, political leadership proceeding cautiously in
                                belief ground must be carefully prepared to assure that defense
                                program, once undertaken, does not falter and become political
                                “football” leading to deterioration moderate conservative

                                    Japanese in past two years have lagged far behind what we have

                                    threatening in military sense than at present. Furthermore, it
                                    is quite likely that any defense budget for 1955 approved under

                                    likely to be obtained if our negotiation tactics are restrained
                                    and based on persuasion. Even twenty million dollars more seems
                                    small dividend in perspective of total cost to build major

                                    Japanese are increasingly sensitive to US policies implying
                                    treatment of Japan as “second-class” nation. Japanese desire

                            <item>While I do not consider Japanese defense effort adequate, over
                                next few years I believe our objectives best achieved by tactics
                                along lines in Embassy study referred to above. Basically,
                                initiative for defense can only come from Japanese if major effort
                                is to be made and sound basis for US-Japanese cooperation formed.
                                Our efforts during next two years should be devoted toward
                                stimulating Japanese initiative by strengthening political and
                                economic foundation and by increasing Japanese sense responsibility
                                for own and Asian defense through such measures as gradual
                                withdrawal US Forces, particularly ground forces, and greater

                                emphasis should be placed on the achievement by moderate
                                conservatives of cohesiveness and strength. The possibility that
                                conservative failure to organize stable effective government in the
                                next year will lead to gradual decline of conservative strength
                                should not be underestimated (see my telegram 1624 January 7).<note

                            Government has recommended clemency or parole. Japanese Government would

                        <p>There is much pressure on US to release the Japanese in near future when
                            it might be politically most effective. It would be difficult retain
                            Germans after that has been done. We should in any event consider it

                            suitable means meeting this situation in view of fact that we have

                                    U.S. allies who had strongly opposed efforts to expedite release
                                    of Japanese war criminals would be embarassed in their relations
                                    with Japan; 3) Japan should be required to fulfill her
                                    obligation undertaken in the peace treaty to carry out sentences

                            the scheduled general elections in Japan it was of course understood
                            that this might be undesirable. The Secretary agreed.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> mentioned the
                            recent approach to Prime Minister Hatoyama by representatives of the
                            USSR at the former’s private residence. He said that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM1">Tani</persName> informed Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> of the visit and hoped that
                            close contact between us could be maintained on this subject. The
                            Secretary agreed, and briefly reviewed the desirability of Japan bearing
                            in mind the principle that existing treaty relations not be affected,
                            pointing out that the San Francisco peace treaty contained an Article
                            which was intended to protect Japan against making new treaties of peace
                            more liberal in terms than those of the San Francisco treaty. He also
                            mentioned the Habomai and Formosa problems. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> said that there is a distinction
                            between the Soviet and Communist China problems, and that there is
                            increasing pressure from Osaka businessmen for trade with the latter. In
                            any event, however, Japan would not violate the <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> regulations. The Secretary asked
                            whether there is much trade with China. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> replied in the negative, said
                            that Mr. Murata <note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">Shozo Murata, Chairman of the
                                Japan International Trade Promotion Association.</note> is now in
                            Peking, presumably negotiating a trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then took up the various subjects mentioned in a number of
                            informal memoranda which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1"
                                >Iguchi</persName> had handed to him. <note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">Not
                                found.</note> On the Formosa question, the Secretary stated that it
                            is our main desire to stabilize the situation and to stop the fighting.
                            On the other hand, we are determined in our own security interests that
                            Formosa and the Pescadores should not fall into unfriendly hands asthis
                            would undermine our entire defense position in the Far East and would
                            result in weakening Japan, among other countries, with the result that
                            Communist strength would be vastly increased. He explained that the
                            Tachen Islands are indefensible except at great cost but that we did not
                            wish to have these islands lost or evacuated without some psychological
                            offset. For this reason the President had asked Congress for increased
                            authority which included the right to attack any Communist buildup
                            specifically directed against Formosa; Quemoy and Matsu Islands were
                            points where Communist buildups could take place for such an attack.
                            Another factor is that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            in a recent statement had made clear the Communist determination to
                            attack Formosa. For these reasons, we must be vigilant. Our policy,
                            however, is not that we wish to stir up things, but rather to find ways
                            and means to settle them.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> asked whether a
                            cease-fire is in the offing. The Secretary briefly explained the New
                            Zealand approach in the Security Council scheduled for today at noon.

                            not accept as he had already publicly committed himself to refuse to

                            the Secretary said that he thought on the whole the Japanese Government
                            should be represented, but hoped that the Japanese delegation would be
                            comprised of high-caliber people. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1"
                                >Iguchi</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1"
                                >Tani</persName>’s name had been mentioned as Japanese
                            representative, although Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> would like to go. The Secretary pointed out
                            the possibility that the Communists, and neutralists led by Nehru, might
                            press for anti-colonial resolutions. There is also the possibility that
                            the doctrine of “Asia for the Asians” would be advocated. As to the
                            former, the Secretary felt that while the US is not particularly
                            involved it could cause difficulties to our friends the French and
                            British. Regarding the “Asia for the Asians” doctrine, this would be
                            intended to break the ties of Asian countries with the US. Under world
                            conditions today there can be no balance of power unless the US throws
                            in its weight. We would of course be glad if Japan could help in this
                            regard but Japan is not yet strong enough to do this. As the Communist
                            aim is to appeal to regional sentiments, as was done by <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> at Berlin, the Secretary hoped
                            that the Japanese delegation would include people who understand that
                            this is one world and that to exclude US influence and ties from any
                            continental area can only result in dominance by the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>On the question of defense, the Secretary said that he understood that
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> is
                            more positive on the question of re-armament. Regarding air fields, the
                            Secretary expressed the hope that Japan would do what it can in its own
                            interests to strengthen the fields as requested. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> said that this would depend
                            somewhat upon the results of the local elections in April.</p>
                        <p>On the question of increasing Japan’s share of exports to the US, the
                            Secretary said that we were doing all we can but that there is
                            considerable opposition. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1"
                                >Iguchi</persName> said he understood this very well, but that many
                            Osaka businessmen are using the tariff question as an excuse in pressing
                            for increased China trade.</p>
                        <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0043"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_IS1">Iguchi</persName> raised the
                            question of war criminals and hoped that something could be done. The
                            Secretary said that he desired to have this problem solved as urgently
                            as possible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated
                            that the principal difficulty arose out of the effects which any
                            over-all action would have on the German war criminal problem and that
                            the matter is presently being studied. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1"
                                >Sebald</persName> said he understood that a staff study will
                            shortly be presented to the Secretary for decision.</p>

                        <p>This proposal envisages the production in Japan of about 500 jet fighter
                            aircraft over the next five years, with an initial program for the
                            procurement of 70 F–86–F aircraft. The dollar cost of the 70 aircraft is
                            estimated to be about $28.4 million and the yen cost, about $12.2
                            million, totaling about $40.6 million. The proposal involves a possible
                            sharing of the total cost of the aircraft by the United States and
                            Japanese Governments, since the Japanese Government would supply the <pb

                            of $28.4 million and, presumably, would subcontract to the producer
                            (probably Mitsubishi) for the aircraft, thereby contributing the yen
                            portion of the total cost.</p>

                            forthcoming Japanese fiscal year beginning April 1, 1955 and urge early
                            approval of this proposal. The Embassy also pointed out the urgency of
                            approval in view of lead-time considerations and the fact that the
                            Japanese Government, now in the process of finalizing its defense budget
                            for Japanese fiscal year 1955, will not make provision for the program
                            unless it has been formally presented by the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Since the initiation of aircraft production in Japan would be a
                            significant step toward the accomplishment of our <gloss

                            that the Department should indicate support of the proposal and offer to
                            assist in finalizing the program. In view of the need for an early
                            decision on the matter, it is believed that early consultation by
                            Defense and the Air Force with the Department and <gloss

                                disastrous. If “general considerations” revised accordingly,
                                “objectives” should be framed to match our capabilities and “courses

                            <item>The Potsdam Proclamation, paragraph (8), reads “The terms of the
                                Cairo Declaration shall be carried out and Japanese sovereignty
                                shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu,
                                Shikoku, and <hi rend="italic">such minor islands as we
                                    determine</hi>.” The Cairo Declaration referred specifically
                                only to “the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as
                                Manchuria, Formosa and the Pescadores”, although it did add “Japan
                                will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken
                                by violence and greed.” The San Francisco Peace Treaty amounts to a
                                “determination” by the Allied Powers as to the “minor islands” which
                                Japan is to renounce. By its terms Japan renounced (a) <pb n="22"
                                    xml:id="pg_22" facs="0050"/>certain islands off Korea; (b)

                                the Antarctic area; and (f) the Spratley and Paracel Islands. In
                                other words, the Treaty appears to be an implementation of the
                                precise terms of the Potsdam Proclamation rather than an attempt to
                                carry out the vague provision of the Cairo Declaration regarding
                                territories taken by violence and greed.</item>

                            <item>It is quite correct to say that Japan did not acquire the Kuriles
                                by violence, but it might be well to remember that they were for a
                                century a matter of dispute with Russia, and that by the Treaty of
                                Amity in 1855, the frontier between the two countries was drawn
                                between the islands of Etorofu and Uruppu, leaving the two southern
                                Kuriles, Kunashir and Etorofu, to Japan, and the 18 northern
                                Kuriles, beginning with Uruppu, to Russia. The Northern Kuriles
                                remained Russian until the St. Petersburg Treaty of 1875, when, in
                                exchange for Japanese claims to Sakhalin, the northern Kuriles were
                                ceded to Japan. By the Treaty of 1905 at Portsmouth, Japan regained
                                the south half of Sakhalin. You are correct that the text of my
                                memorandum of October 28, 1954, does not make this clear, but I
                                thought I had cleared it up by the footnote.</item>

                            <item>The United States cannot consistently take the position that Japan
                                has not renounced the Kuriles, any more than she could take the
                                position that she had not renounced Formosa and the Pescadores. She
                                must, in view of the position taken by the Secretary and by the
                                United States Senate, contend that their disposition is for future
                                international action. It would be perfectly consistent for the
                                United States to support Japan in the argument that these islands,
                                or part of them, should be returned to Japan by international
                                action, such as an accord among the Allied Powers, including the

                                above.</note> on Japanese defense measures to the Foreign Office.
                            The memorandum reviewed the principles of the Mutual Security Program,
                            the dependence of United States military assistance on Japan’s own
                            defense effort, the fact that contrary to Japanese contentions Japan’s
                            agreed contribution to the support of United States forces in Japan
                            ($155 million) is less than half the expenditures for such forces, and
                            proposed that the United States and Japan share on an equal basis the
                            cost for additional expenses for the Japanese defense forces above a
                            mutually agreeable figure. Specifically, the memorandum proposed a base
                            figure of 90 billion yen ($250 million). For example, if Japan were
                            willing to appropriate the 95.2 billion yen ($264 million) requested by
                            the Defense agency, the United States would accept a 2.6 billion yen ($7
                            million) reduction in Japan’s contribution to the support of United
                            States forces in Japan.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum was in response to an aide-mémoire handed to Ambassador

                            forces in Japan through unhurried negotiations after the elections. The

                            election campaign, as incomprehensible and one which may invite
                            criticism as a deliberate American attempt to interfere in the internal
                            affairs of Japan. The Foreign Office is reported to be at odds with the
                            Finance Ministry over the role which the United States should play in
                            determining Japan’s defense expenditures. As for the 90 billion yen
                            figure, the Finance Ministry is reported to consider that this figure is
                            hardly worth attention in future talks with Washington.</p>
                        <p>This reaction by Japanese officials and its discussion in the press are
                            evidence of a growing tendency on the part of the Japanese to assert an

                            defense budget even more difficult. While the United States position,
                            stated in the memorandum, is consistent with broad instructions given to

                            understanding that the Embassy was under considerable pressure from the
                            Command as to the substance of the memorandum.</p>
                        <p>It can be expected that the Embassy and Command will shortly request

                            85 billion yen presently authorized. In view of the developing political
                            and economic situation in Japan, it is believed that the <gloss

                            the authority originally requested to go to a base figure as low as 73.8
                            billion yen. However, it has become public knowledge that the United
                            States position is that the budget for the Japanese defense forces
                            should be at least 90 billion yen before the United States would even
                            agree to match <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> Japanese budgetary
                            figures with reductions in their contribution to the United States
                            forces. This appears to the Japanese to be renewed United States
                            pressure on the defense issue, and we believe that it has had a bad

                        <p>It is doubtful that Japan will agree to the principle of matching any
                            reduction in its contribution to the support of United States forces
                            with an equivalent increase in its defense budget, even though a more
                            reasonable base figure is eventally authorized. It is more likely that
                            Japan will attempt to reduce, as far as possible, its contribution to
                            the support of United States forces with a view to using some of the
                            reduction for non-defense purposes. <note n="6" xml:id="d14fn6">In a

                                will be a minority government requiring Liberal or Socialist
                                support. It will postpone hard decisions and make palatable those
                                measures it is forced to take. Internally Hatoyama’s Democratic
                                Party suffers from dissensions accentuated by the expected brevity
                                of his political life. Hatoyama is emotional, naive in international
                                affairs, and loves public acclaim. He has, however, some extremely

                                    Hatoyama’s direct dealings in Tokyo. The Government will
                                    increase contacts with Communist China, even to the extent of
                                    permitting the establishment of an unofficial trade mission in

                                through reduction of Japan’s contribution to the support of United
                                States forces. Japan’s policy will be justified on the basis of the
                                need for increased appropriations for social livelihood measures and
                                the lack of a firm Diet majority. Hatoyama’s advocacy of increased
                                defense efforts will be for the purpose of hastening United States
                                troop withdrawals. The United States will be expected to pay a high

                                Policies likely to be continued as a result of electoral popularity
                                are expansion of trade with Communist China, expansion of social
                                welfare measures, reduction of taxes and defense expenditures. The
                                new Government will assume that the United States’ need for Japan is

                                problems depends on our convincing Japan that its own self-interest

                                    noted the fact that the two Socialist groups now have over

                                        the early optimism that assumed that Japan’s commitment of

                                capacity (para 6 and <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>) risks the

                        <p>There is one aspect of the paper in particular which I wish to call to
                            your attention. In this paper we take a stand that efforts to develop
                            Japan’s political stability and economic strength should be given
                            priority in both time and emphasis over efforts to build Japan’s
                            military power. This point of view is reflected in a number of ways in
                            the paper. In nearly every case I have stated the position somewhat more
                            strongly than the actual facts justify. Tactically, this gives us room
                            to bargain with Defense in the discussions at the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board, so I hope that if you
                            accept the basic thesis you will agree to let this somewhat over-stated
                            language stand for the present. In this connection, I refer particularly

                                    Japanese contribution to United States forces in Japan, provided
                                    that the Japanese devote the sums thus released to the

                                    draft revealed conflict among the Departments of State and
                                    Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the language quoted
                                    above and on other military sections, a conflict more clearly
                                    delineated in a draft of March 24. Regarding the March 24 draft,

                            submission to the Planning Board—we should take the position stated in
                            paragraph 9(c) with respect to the withdrawal of United States ground
                            forces from Japan. Defense will probably argue, with a good deal of
                            reason, that there is simply no place else in the Far East to station
                            these forces.</p>

                            emphasis to political and economic stability greatly appreciated. In my
                            discussions with Japanese, I have as much as possible adopted attitude
                            consistent with our recommendations. For this reason I have told
                            Japanese only that we hope for some increase in total defense budget in
                            return for reduction support costs and that we unwilling to bear total
                            burden of increase. I have left indefinite amount of increase in hope
                            that our negotiating position will be sufficiently modified to permit
                            quick agreement without acrimonious discussions.</p>
                        <p>However problem of avoiding heated and public debate on defense budget
                            complicated by two factors. In first place, until it is possible to
                            obtain defense agreement to new negotiating positions, I feel it is
                            necessary not to wander too far from explicit instructions given me and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">General Hull</persName>. <gloss
                                target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> equally concerned adhere to Washington
                            position this matter and we are agreed that it is required to make real
                            effort to present clearly our initial negotiation position as
                            instructed. To certain extent, we have managed to soften impact of these
                            positions on Japanese by indicating that we wish to understand their
                            position and to consider it reasonably. We have, in contrast to
                            Japanese, avoided public statements.</p>
                        <p>However, Japanese are making it increasingly difficult to hold our fire.
                            That is our second basic problem. When Embassy recommendations made last
                            October, we assumed Japanese would agree to at least token increase in
                            defense budget. Japanese are now down to maximum figure of yen 132.7
                            billion and there are already inspired press stories mentioning defense
                            budget of yen 1.4 billion and yen 20 billion reduction in yen
                            contribution. Their position is that not only should we finance all of
                            any increase they make but a portion of next year’s <pb n="32"
                                xml:id="pg_32" facs="0060"/>costs of existing defense forces.
                            Japanese are forcing us to take this stand not to get large increase but
                            just to maintain budget at last year’s level after 4.5 billion
                            reduction.</p>
                        <p>I hope Department understands Embassy has not initiated drive for greatly
                            increased Japanese defense effort; on contrary it is Japanese who in
                            press and by handling of provisional budget have initiated campaign for
                            decrease in overall defense effort. Defense budget question is
                            unfortunately not isolated instance of such tactics on part of Japanese.
                            If we bow to such tactics in these defense negotiations, how can we
                            expect to defend and promote US objectives in other matters? Hatoyama
                            government has consistently ignored US interest in handling almost all
                            pending US-Japanese problems such as <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1"
                                >GARIOA</gloss>, tariff list, etc., and at same time has made
                            continued concessions to Commie orbit such as latest action on visas to

                            dissatisfied with current attitude toward relations with US. I believe
                            we must therefore adopt firm attitude once we are certain that our
                            positions are equitable and in US interests. What is involved is not
                            question of hard bargaining tactics but effort to convince Japanese our
                            relations must be two-way street and that they, too, have to make
                            concessions. Question as I understand <persName corresp="#p_HHS1"
                                >Hensel</persName> realized is whether their performance is to be
                            minimum which administration and Congress may be willing to support.</p>
                        <p>Japanese are far from unconcerned about US attitude. In fact, many top
                            officials are increasingly worried about “Washington” getting the “wrong
                            idea” (see Embtel 2351). <note n="5" xml:id="d21fn5">Apparent

                            about time we plucked this sensitive nerve. A few discreet expressions
                            of anxiety from “highly placed” sources might serve to keep the Japanese
                            worried. If Hatoyama government stops taking for granted our good will,
                            they may do a little more than making an occasional statement about the
                            need for good relations with US.</p>

                                the adoption of the Defense–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                                proposal as constituting a more desirable criterion for the
                                determination of the time when the United States should indicate its
                                willingness to initiate negotiations. With reference to the wording
                                of paragraph 52, <note n="4" xml:id="d22fn4">This paragraph reads as
                                    follows: “Develop with the Japanese Government a general
                                    understanding on a long-range plan for the build-up of Japanese
                                    defense forces, a phased withdrawal from Japan of United States
                                    ground forces as consistent with United States and Japanese
                                    security interests, and related reductions of the Japanese
                                    contribution to the support of United States forces in Japan;
                                    and make such understanding public at a suitable time. In such
                                    understanding, seek to obtain Japanese agreement that the
                                    amounts released by any reductions in Japanese contributions to
                                    the support of U.S. forces in Japan will be devoted to the
                                    development of Japanese defense forces.” A footnote in the
                                    source text states: “Defense believes no steps should be taken
                                    under this paragraph until the Formosan situation has been
                                    clarified.”</note> the Joint Chiefs of Staff suggest that in the
                                fourth line the word “ground” be deleted from the phrase “United
                                States ground forces” and in the eleventh line that the phrase “will
                                be devoted to” be amended to read “will be <hi rend="italic">matched
                                    by Japan and the total</hi> devoted to”. Regarding the proposal
                                contained in the footnote to paragraph 52 that “no steps should be
                                taken under this paragraph until the Formosan situation has been
                                clarified”, the Joint Chiefs of Staff feel that this would be
                                unnecessarily <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0062"/>restrictive and
                                might serve to delay indefinitely the orderly development of a plan
                                for the build-up of Japanese defense forces and for the phased
                                withdrawal of United States forces. The Joint Chiefs of Staff assume
                                that any such plan which might be formulated would be sufficiently
                                flexible as to permit alteration in the light of contingencies which
                                may develop.</item>

                        <p>2490. Re Embtel 2487. <note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2"><p>In telegram 2487,
                                    April 1, <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> reported
                                    learning from <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>
                                    that the Cabinet had decided to send the Foreign Minister to the
                                    United States within 2 weeks in order to get U.S. agreement to a
                                    reduction in the yen contribution to U.S. forces in Japan.
                                    According to the Ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                        >Shigemitsu</persName> stressed that failure of the United
                                    States to agree to this might lead to a left-wing government in
                                    Japan, while a successful negotiation would increase the
                                    prestige of the Foreign Minister and other pro-American
                                    conservative elements, and would, he believed, result in
                                    formation of a strong pro-American conservative government
                                    within a few months.</p>
                                <p>The Ambassador stated he had replied it would be difficult to
                                    receive <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> on
                                    short notice and it would be dangerous for the Foreign Minister
                                    to go to Washington and perhaps return empty-handed. In asking
                                    Washington for instructions, <persName corresp="#p_AJM1"
                                        >Allison</persName> stressed these two negative factors and
                                    pointed as well to the precedent such a negotiation might set in
                                    bypassing himself and <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>.
                                    However, he also suggested:</p>
                                <p>“There is, I believe, possibility that imaginative response to
                                        <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> plea might
                                    pay big dividends. Any such response should be agreed upon prior
                                    to departure of <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>
                                    for United States. His visit then could be short and primarily
                                    for purpose of placing outward stamp of approval on agreement.
                                        (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 033.9411/4–155)</p></note>
                            Despite solemn caution against premature publicity re <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>’s proposed trip all morning
                            papers today carry lead stories stating Foreign Minister plans to leave
                            for Washington <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0063"/>during next week
                            to be gone week or ten days. Purpose of visit is said to be explanation
                            of Japan’s “new diplomacy” and to seek agreement on reduction of Japan’s
                            share in joint defense costs.</p>
                        <p>This completely irresponsible action on part of Japanese Government
                            places U.S. in most awkward position. If we now consent to receive
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> Japanese will gain
                            impression they can act toward U.S. with impunity in any manner they see
                            fit. If we refuse to receive Foreign Minister we will be charged with
                            “insincerity”, with applying undue pressure (although in fact pressure
                            is being applied by Japanese) and we can expect great upsurge of
                            anti-Americanism.</p>
                        <p>In spite of this, however, I now believe that our best tactic would be to
                            refuse to receive <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> until
                            and unless some basis for agreement is reached by negotiations in Tokyo.
                            If our action causes present government to fall, which it might,
                            responsibility is clearly theirs. In view of Hatoyama’s recent actions I
                            am not at all sure we should be worse off if he were to leave
                            office.</p>
                        <p>I therefore recommend that I be authorized to tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> that while the President and
                            the Secretary have long hoped to meet with him it is impossible for them
                            to rearrange their schedules at such short notice. Furthermore, it
                            should be made clear that Departments of State and Defense will not be
                            in a position to discuss details and make any agreement unless
                            negotiations in Tokyo with Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1"
                                >CINCFE</gloss> have laid proper basis. Japanese should be left in
                            no doubt that attempt to bypass officials on the spot can only delay
                            matters.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tani</persName> has just telephoned me to
                            express his regrets at premature publicity after in his words “your
                            solemn warning”. I told <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tani</persName> that,
                            while I had no instructions, in my opinion this publicity would make it
                            most unlikely that my government could receive <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>. I pointed out that although
                            there had been press stories for several weeks about a possible special
                            envoy to U.S. that the American Government had not been approached
                            officially or unofficially until less than 24 hours before published
                            story that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> was leaving
                            for Washington. I told him I thought Japanese Government had acted in
                            most irresponsible manner and that my government had been placed in
                            extremely embarrassing position. I concluded by saying that while it
                            still might be possible for President and Secretary rearrange their
                            schedules and receive <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> I
                            was not at all certain this would be case. <persName corresp="#p_TM1"
                                >Tani</persName> said he would tell <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> what I had said.</p>

                                suitable early date” to negotiate a mutual defense treaty to replace

                                that the Japanese will be in a position to negotiate such a treaty
                                in the near future.</item>

                                general understanding with the Japanese on a long-range plan for
                                their defense forces, a phased withdrawal of our forces and phased
                                reductions of the Japanese contribution to our forces. Here again
                                the problem is one of timing. Defense wants no steps like this taken
                                “until the Formosa situation has been clarified”. The <gloss

                                    made only on a matching basis—for example, Japan will be allowed
                                    a $20 million reduction in contribution only if that $20 million
                                    plus $20 million of new Japanese funds are devoted to defense
                                    purposes. This is simply not a practical position for us to

                                <item>The position the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> wants us
                                    to take in the current defense negotiations runs directly
                                    counter to the proposed <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                    policy because it is doing serious damage to hopes of political
                                    stability in Japan. The abortive <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                        >Shigemitsu</persName> visit is known to have centered
                                    around the defense issue. The USSR response on negotiations with
                                    Japan has further shaken the Hatoyama cabinet. Local elections
                                    in Japan are April 23. Failure to reach a satisfactory
                                    arrangement on the defense issue before April 16–20 will
                                    increase the prospect of substantial Socialist gains in these
                                    local elections, thus placing more local political machines in
                                    the hands of the Socialists. This is particularly dangerous
                                    since new national elections in Japan will be brought measurably
                                    sooner if the life <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0068"/>of the
                                    Hatoyama cabinet is endangered by protracted and (from the
                                    Japanese point of view) losing negotiations with the United
                                    States over the defense issue. Certainly our hope for an
                                    increased Japanese defense effort is more likely of realization
                                    if the Conservatives stay in power.</item>

                                <item>It is therefore in the United States interest to reach a
                                    settlement with Japan by April 16 or very shortly thereafter on
                                    a basis which keeps Japan spending on defense as much of its own
                                    money as it spent last year (132.7 billion yen), and is also

                            dated April 5, 1955)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> commenced his
                            briefing of the Council by referring to the general considerations with
                            which the subject report commenced. When he had reached paragraph
                                13,<note n="2" xml:id="d26fn2">This paragraph reads: “Japan’s broad
                                objectives are to recover a position of international influence and
                                prestige and to strengthen its economic position. Japan considers
                                that increase of defense strength is of lower priority, partly
                                because it believes that its defense will be assured by the United
                                States. While political stability is desired by most Japanese, sharp
                                and persisting conflicts between rival personalities and factions
                                seriously retard its development.”</note> Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> interrupted him to say that he
                            disagreed with the first sentence of this paragraph, which read:
                            “Japan’s broad objectives are to recover a position of international
                            influence and prestige and to strengthen its economic position.”
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the
                            first portion of this sentence was simply not factual. We had done
                            everything that we could think of to stir up in Japan a desire to assume
                            a position of international influence once again, and the results had
                            been markedly unsuccessful. Indeed, the Japanese were utterly lethargic
                            and lacking <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0069"/>in any perceptible
                            ambition to recover their pre-war international prestige. Even under
                            proddings which approached the brutal, they remained inert.</p>
                        <p>The President then referred to the widespread growth of nationalism which
                            had become obvious in the world since the end of the war. He said that
                            it was very alarming to observe how the Communists had managed to
                            identify themselves and their purposes with this emergent nationalism.
                            The United States, on the other hand, had failed to utilize this new
                            spirit of nationalism in its own interest. While this phenomenon was
                            general, Japan was a notable illustration. Accordingly, if Japan grew
                            more strongly nationalist, we should play up more to this development in
                            order to bend it to our advantage. The President said he was aware that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STC1">Streibert</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> had been doing a great deal
                            of thinking about this problem; but nevertheless the fact remained that
                            the Communists seemed to be more successful in this area than we
                            did.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> inquired
                            whether, in view of these observations, the Council desired to change
                            the first sentence of paragraph 13.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> repeated his
                            earlier statement that it was simply not a fact that Japan desired to
                            recover a position of international influence and prestige, although it
                            was true that Japan wanted to strengthen her economy.</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen said that the position the President had taken with
                            respect to the success of Communist exploitation of national feelings
                            was emphatically true. Accordingly, the United States must try to
                            identify Japan’s national objectives with its own. In addition, the
                            United States should place more emphasis on the obvious fact that the
                            Communists ultimately obliterated all national objectives. Governor
                            Stassen indicated his understanding that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_STC1"
                                >Streibert</persName> was doing what he could to exploit this
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that one means of doing this was to stress what
                            we had done in the Philippines as evidence of our sympathy for
                            nationalist aspirations. He repeated his feeling of exasperation over
                            the fact that the assistance which the United States gave to foreign
                            nations was so frequently misunderstood; while the Communists, who were
                            really enemies of these nationalist aspirations, were given a great deal
                            of credit as being friendly to these aspirations.</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen indicated that as far as Japan was concerned the
                            situation might be greatly improved when the debts and reparations
                            settlements had finally been concluded. At the end of this discussion
                            the President stated once again that with this nationalist spirit so
                            widespread in the world, the United States must find ways and means to
                            capitalize on it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName>, after
                            suggesting a rewording of the first sentence of paragraph 13, continued
                            with his briefing of the paper, and read to the Council paragraphs 21
                            through 24 of the general considerations, which set forth the problem of
                            building Japanese strength. Thereafter he called attention to the split
                            of views in paragraph 35, which read as follows: “Indicate [at a
                            suitable early date] [at a mutually advantageous time]<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d26fn3">Brackets in the source text.</note> willingness to
                            negotiate replacement of the present United States-Japan Security Treaty
                            by a treaty of mutual defense which would include the right to maintain
                            forces in Japan and the right upon Japan’s request to aid Japan in
                            resisting subversion or infiltration by unfriendly forces.”</p>
                        <p>The President stated that he was completely at a loss to understand the
                            difference between “a suitable early date” and a “mutually advantageous
                            time”. This appeared to him a distinction without a difference.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he had a
                            more profound disagreement with paragraph 35 than that suggested by the
                            bracketed language. In short, he did not think it wise to supplant our
                            present treaty with Japan with a new one. This could not be done without
                            a grave loss of advantage to the United States. If we suggest a new
                            mutual defense treaty to the Japanese they will certainly want to model
                            such a treaty on the existing mutual defense treaties between the U.S.

                            of the Japanese Government. Moreover, the treaties for mutual defense
                            ran for a much shorter time than is desirable in the light of the
                            present situation. Such mutual defense treaties were subject to
                            termination in a year’s time at the behest of either partner.
                            Accordingly, concluded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"

                            a great deal stronger than it was at the present time, he was firmly

                        <p>The President expressed some surprise, because he thought that it was the
                            State Department which had proposed the substitution of a mutual defense
                                treaty.<note n="6" xml:id="d26fn6">Language to this effect appears

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that
                            whatever the source of the proposal he was strongly opposed to it. The
                            President inquired what we might be expected to gain by a new mutual
                            defense treaty which we do not already have. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that we <pb n="43"
                                xml:id="pg_43" facs="0071"/>would gain nothing, with which view the
                            Acting Secretary of Defense, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Robert
                                Anderson</persName>, expressed agreement. Accordingly the Council
                            decided to delete paragraph 35 in its entirety.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> pointed out the
                            relationship between paragraph 35 and paragraph 52, which called for
                            developing “with the Japanese Government a general understanding on a
                            long-range plan for the build-up of Japanese defense forces, a phased
                            withdrawal from Japan of United States ground forces as consistent with
                            United States and Japanese security interests, etc.”. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> warned that if the
                            United States Government suggested such a proposal to the Japanese
                            Government at this time, the substance of it would undoubtedly become
                            public, and the resultant psychological repercussions would be very
                            unfortunate for us in view of the situation in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then said that he
                            wished to comment on paragraph 44, which read: “Support Japan’s claim
                            against the Soviet Union for sovereignty over the Habbomai Islands and
                            Shikotan; treat as legally invalid the Soviet Union’s claim to
                            sovereignty over the Kurile Islands and Southern Sakhalin.” Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he agreed
                            with the first portion of the sentence, but disagreed with the proposals
                            relating to Soviet claims to sovereignty over the Kuriles and Southern
                            Sakhalin. If we carried out this course of action he warned that we
                            would be marching onto very treacherous ground. The Soviet claim to the
                            Kuriles and Southern Sakhalin was substantially the same as our claim to
                            be in the Ryukyus and the Bonin Islands. Accordingly, in our efforts to
                            force the Soviets out of the Kuriles and Sakhalin, we might find
                            ourselves forced out of the Ryukyus and the Bonins. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> cited the terms of the peace
                            treaty with Japan in which the Japanese agreed to confine themselves to
                            the four major islands of the homeland. It was this which enabled us to
                            maintain our own positions in Japanese territories outside the four main
                            islands. He repeated that if we succeeded in getting the Russians out of
                            the Kuriles it is certain that we would be forced out of the
                            Ryukyus.</p>
                        <p>The President stated with a smile that it was also certain that we would
                            not succeed in getting the Russians out of the Kuriles.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> emphasized that
                            the Ryukyus were more valuable to the United States than the Kuriles
                            were to the Soviet Union. Obviously, therefore, we should not imperil
                            our position in the Ryukyus. The President agreed to removing the
                            offending phrase in paragraph 44, and pointed out that the only reason
                            he had initially accepted it was because he did not think we had ever
                            claimed sovereignty over the Ryukyus. Governor Stassen suggested that
                            instead of removing the disputed phrase it should be changed to read “do
                            not concede the Soviet Union’s claim, etc., etc.”. Governor Stassen’s
                            suggestion was accepted,</p>
                        <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0072"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> thereupon
                            resumed his briefing of the remaining paragraphs of the paper, dealing
                            first with the military courses of action—paragraphs 49 through 57. When
                            he reached paragraph 52, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> indicated that he opposed the proposal by the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff for a rewording of the last sentence of the
                            paragraph. The Joint Chiefs had desired to say that “reductions in
                            Japanese contributions to the support of U.S. forces in Japan will be
                            matched by Japan and the total devoted to the development of Japanese
                            defense forces.” <note n="7" xml:id="d26fn7">See <ref target="#d22"
                                    >Document 22</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> explained the
                            reasons for the Joint Chiefs’ proposal, and indicated his support for
                            it. He thought, nevertheless, that no part of paragraph 52, which
                            involved a long-range plan for the build-up of Japanese forces and a
                            phased withdrawal from Japan of U.S. forces, should actually be set in
                            motion until there was a notable easing of the present tension in the
                            Far East.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> returned to his
                            objections to the last sentence of paragraph 52, pointing out that the
                            formula which governed Japanese contributions to the support of U.S.
                            forces in Japan as proposed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was much too
                            rigid. For every dollar the Japanese gained by being obliged to provide
                            less dollars for the support of the U.S. forces, they were obliged to
                            throw in yet another dollar for creating additional Japanese defense
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The President, agreeing with the Secretary of State that this was too
                            much to ask of the Japanese, said we would be making a horrible mistake
                            by pushing these people too hard.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then indicated
                            that he wanted to speak on the more general subject of paragraph
                            52—namely, the build-up of Japanese defense forces. He said that
                            negotiations on this subject were now going on with the Japanese
                            Government. The State Department hoped very much that these negotiations
                            would be completed before the provincial and local elections came up in
                            Japan on April 20. The question of the appropriate Japanese contribution
                            to their military budget would be a very great issue in this forthcoming
                            election. He believed that we had tended to push the Japanese too hard.
                            We must be more cautious, because it was manifest that there was a
                            strong pacifist sentiment abroad in Japan. In part, we ourselves were
                            responsible for this, since we had imposed a pacifist constitution on
                            the Japanese. Over and above these facts, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the Japanese
                            were greatly concerned about their economic situation. To make matters
                            worse, Communist propaganda was capitalizing on all these grievances. So
                            that while Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said
                            he of course realized the importance of rearming Japan as promptly as
                            possible, he could see no sense in doing so if you ended up by putting
                            arms <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0073"/>in the hands of people who
                            are going to shoot in the wrong direction. Finally, he feared a
                            weakening of the conservative parties in Japan, with the possibility
                            that the Japanese socialists might eventually gain control. While the
                            elections on April 20 were local rather than national, they were
                            important because those who controlled the local political machinery
                            might eventually determine the results of a national election. To
                            illustrate his point, he compared the situation with the state political
                            machines in the United States and their manifest influence on U.S.
                            national elections. In conclusion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> hoped that the Department of Defense would come
                            to feel that we should settle this defense contribution issue as quickly
                            as possible, and that the U.S. could make concessions which would help
                            to maintain control of Japan in the hands of the conservatives.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said, speaking
                            frankly, he could not disagree with the Secretary of State. He said it
                            was of course natural that the Service staffs in the Pentagon should
                            desire to build the defensive strength of Japan as rapidly as possible.
                            But he personally had no real difference of view with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President cited the case of Turkey as evidence of the Tightness of
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ view. The Turks
                            had now more of a military establishment than they were really able to
                            support and cope with. The President also added that more help must be
                            given to Japan to improve its economy. He suggested that a certain
                            amount of trade in Japanese consumers goods with Communist China might
                            assist in solving this latter problem. He added that he gathered that
                            the Secretaries of State and Defense would agree on new language to
                            replace the disputed last sentence of paragraph 52. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, however, suggested that the
                            Council agree to use the language which appeared in the present draft,
                            but to reject the changes suggested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in that
                            language. The Council accepted this position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName> then went on to
                            describe the economic courses of action and read paragraph 61, <note
                                n="8" xml:id="d26fn8">This paragraph reads as follows: “Assist the
                                Japanese economy through the appropriate extension of public credit
                                to Japan, the use of technical assistance, the use of local currency
                                proceeds of agricultural surpluses and the widening of opportunities
                                for the investment of Japanese capital.”</note> with respect to the
                            provision of assistance by the United States to the Japanese economy,
                            both by the extension of public credit to Japan and by widening
                            opportunities for the investment of private capital in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen said that paragraph 61 was in accordance with existing
                            basic national security policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> asked Governor Stassen if he would care to
                            comment on the evident Japanese antagonism to the influx of any
                            significant amount of foreign capital. If this was indeed the case, as
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> understood it to
                            be, <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0074"/>should the United States not
                            put greater emphasis on trying to induce the Japanese to follow more
                            liberal policies with respect to the investment of private capital?</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen indicated that he had made efforts in this direction in
                            all his conferences and contacts with the Japanese. He admitted,
                            however, that the results had been spotty. It was not so much that the
                            Japanese objected in principle and as a general rule to the introduction
                            of all foreign capital or to the activities of all foreign companies in
                            Japan. Their point of view depended on a particular industry or a
                            particular company. The Singer Sewing Machine Company had experienced
                            great difficulties in Japan. On the other hand, International Business
                            Machines, certain of the U.S. oil companies, and Westing-house had been
                            very successful.</p>
                        <p>The Director of the Budget confirmed Governor Stassen’s appraisal on the
                            basis of his own experience in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> said that this
                            attitude was closely related to the national feeling of the Japanese.
                            American companies who went along with this Japanese national sentiment
                            were welcome. Those who tried to buck it were not.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName>
                            called the Council’s attention to paragraph 66, <note n="9"
                                xml:id="d26fn9">This paragraph reads: “Encourage Japan to relax or
                                remove legal and administrative barriers and to improve the climate
                                for private investment, domestic and foreign.”</note> a course of
                            action by the United States to encourage Japan to improve the climate
                            for private investment, both domestic and foreign.</p>
                        <p>The President then said he wished to go back to paragraph 62, <note
                                n="10" xml:id="d26fn10">This paragraph reads: “Promote the expansion
                                of Japan’s trade through United States participation in programs of
                                economic development in free Asia; give particular emphasis to
                                development projects which would tend to increase sound
                                intra-regional trade; use Japan as a source of supply to the extent
                                practicable in connection with United States-financed aid programs;
                                encourage Japan to contribute to the development of South and
                                Southeast Asia by providing technical assistance and
                                financing.”</note> which dealt with efforts to promote the expansion
                            of Japan’s trade and commerce. If, said the President, we are going to
                            continue to ignore Japan’s evident desire to trade with the Chinese
                            Communists, he would like to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                                >Dodge</persName>’s committee (the Council on Foreign Economic
                            Policy) study the validity of the view that such trade between Japan and
                            the Communist states is exclusively bad. After all, said the President,
                            as he had frequently mentioned before, trade was the best weapon of the
                            diplomat. He therefore wanted to see this analysis and study made. In
                            fact, he had been calling for it for over two years, and his request had
                            been ignored.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out to
                            the President the uniform Communist practice of funneling trade into the
                            particular channels that they desire, rather than to permit it to be a
                            means of contact between peoples.</p>
                        <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0075"/>
                        <p>Governor Stassen pointed out that the study to which the President had
                            referred had already been given to the <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                                >Dodge</persName> committee to prepare. Unhappily, very strong
                            differences of view had emerged in the Council on Foreign Economic
                            Policy, although a progress report would shortly be presented to the
                            President. <note n="11" xml:id="d26fn11">For documentation on the
                                activities of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, see <ref

                        <p>The President observed that of course if the Secretary of State’s view on
                            the funneling of trade by the Communists was correct, that would change
                            the whole picture he had in mind when he referred to Japanese trade with
                            the people of Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen described briefly the problems encountered in the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> committee with regard
                            to the problems of trade between Japan and Communist China. The single
                            biggest issue was whether or not to reduce the level of controls on
                            trade with Communist China (<gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss>
                            controls) to the same level agreed upon for controls on trade with the
                            Soviet Union and the European satellites (<gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> controls). <note n="12" xml:id="d26fn12"
                                >Documentation on this question is printed in <ref
                                    target="frus1955-57v10#pg_203">vol. x, pp. 203</ref> ff.</note>
                            Governor Stassen also emphasized to the President that the Soviets and
                            the Chinese Communists do not want to trade with Japan in consumers
                            goods, but instead wished to buy materials which contributed to the
                            development of heavy industry and war potential.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it seemed to him that if it were the Communists
                            themselves, rather than U.S.-inspired controls, that represented the
                            chief reason for the failure of any significant trade developments
                            between Japan and Communist China, the least the United States could do
                            was to make this fact perfectly plain and put the blame where it
                            belonged—on the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that we
                            had done our best to make it plain that the failure of Japan to achieve
                            a market for its consumers goods in Communist China was primarily caused
                            by Chinese Communist policy.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed great skepticism as to whether we had succeeded
                            in making this matter clear to the Japanese. To explain what he meant,
                            he referred briefly to his well-known speech on the peaceful uses of
                            atomic energy. Despite the content of this speech, polls recently taken
                            in a variety of foreign nations indicated that not more than one percent
                            of the population of these nations actually believed that the United
                            States was earnestly concerned with promoting the peaceful uses of
                            atomic energy. Thus, while the “big shots” in the Japanese Government
                            may be quite aware that it was the Communists and not the United States
                            which was responsible for Japan’s inability <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48"
                                facs="0076"/>to sell its consumers goods in China, the President
                            doubted very much whether the “little people” in Japan really understood
                            this fact and realized that the Communists were at fault.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> suggested that
                            progress might be made in this area through the creation of a Joint
                            U.S-Japanese commission on trade and commerce. The President did not
                            seem to react positively to this proposal. He reverted to his point that
                            the Japanese blamed us more for the restrictions on their trade than
                            they did the Russians. They listened to speeches by Senator Knowland and
                            other Members of Congress, and thought that these speeches represented
                            the Administration’s policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> commented at the end of
                            the discussion that while the President’s point of view had validity
                            from the propaganda angle, he doubted if it was valid from a practical
                            point of view. After all, the consumers goods that the President wanted
                            the Japanese to sell—such as rubber shoes, straw hats and the like—would
                            not be sold directly to the people of Communist China; if they were sold
                            at all they would be sold to a Chinese Communist government monopoly,
                            which would then resell them to the population. Accordingly, there was
                            very little likelihood that trade between Japan and Communist China
                            would help to advance understanding among peoples.</p>

                        <p>2559. Pass Defense. At Prime Minister’s request, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> and I called on him and
                            had hour’s conversation yesterday morning. During first part of
                            conversation Hatoyama stressed his deep friendship for US and his desire
                            to work closely and in complete accord with US. He recalled his many
                            public statements in the past as well as his private statement to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in 1951 that he
                            sincerely believed in necessity for Japan to rearm and to this end for
                            the Japanese Constitution to be amended. He had hoped that in the recent
                            election the conservatives would get two-thirds of Diet seats thus
                            making possible an amendment of the Constitution. However, this had not
                            come to pass and instead Socialists had strengthened their position.
                            Since election, according to Hatoyama, Socialists have increased their
                            popularity among the people and are taking much more intransigent stand
                            than had been anticipated. To date Liberal Party has apppeared more
                            interested in embarrassing Hatoyama government, even if this means
                            working with Socialists, than working for true best interests of Japan.
                            Hatoyama’s policy and his many public statements have been designed to
                            cut ground from under Socialists by appearing to embrace many of their
                            objectives particularly in field of social welfare. It is essential,
                            according to Prime Minister, for his government to get through present
                            situation of Diet and this cannot take place if they fail to pass the
                            budget. If it is impossible to secure US agreement to reduction in
                            Japan’s defense contribution or to a sufficient reduction, it will be
                            impossible to pass the budget and the government will probably fall.
                            Should this happen it can benefit no one but the left wing. On the other
                            hand, if US will understand Japan’s position, have faith in Hatoyama,
                            and make such concessions as necessary to get budget through Diet,
                            Hatoyama maintains he will then be able to begin to achieve his
                            objectives of increased armament and close cooperation with U.S. One of
                            first steps will be effort to achieve amendment of <pb n="50"
                                xml:id="pg_50" facs="0078"/>election law providing for smaller
                            one-man districts as it is believed this will ensure at least two-thirds
                            conservative majority next Diet. Hatoyama also said that if government
                            succeeded in getting budget through Diet and surviving present session
                            it would then be possible to work for conservative merger and he would
                            do all in his power to bring this about. At present Prime Minister
                            claimed that the government is in an extremely shaky position and he
                            stated action of Foreign Affairs Committee of Lower House (see Embtel
                            2546) <note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2"><p>According to telegram 2546, April
                                    7, the Committee had on April 6 passed a resolution reading in
                                    translation as follows:</p>
                                <p>“The Hatoyama Cabinet in diplomatic activities has lacked a
                                    unanimity of opinion within the Cabinet.</p>
                                <p>“Besides, its careless handling of diplomatic affairs has greatly
                                    soiled the prestige of Japan in the world community.</p>
                                <p>“Thus, the government has made a serious blunder. This Committee
                                    demands that the government reflect sincerely upon its own
                                    conduct so that same mistake will not be repeated.” (<hi
                                        rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 794.13/4–755)</p></note> in
                            passing admonishing resolution against government over failure of
                            proposed <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> trip was most
                            unfortunate and was an indication of weakness of government’s position.
                            I intervened at this juncture to point out that if government had
                            prevented premature publicity of decision to send <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> to Washington, problem would
                            not have arisen. At least in same degree. Hatoyama then explained that
                            he greatly regretted this premature publicity and that he had assumed
                            from what <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> had said in
                            Cabinet meeting that groundwork for trip had already been laid. It had
                            come as surprise to him that first notice Embassy had had to [<hi
                                rend="italic">of</hi>] trip was less than 24 hours prior to
                            newspaper stories. Hatoyama’s original intent had been to send <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTF1">Matsumoto</persName> as an informal envoy to U.S.
                            for purpose of talking with his many friends there and endeavoring to
                            explain Hatoyama’s true intentions with regard to U.S.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (131/2 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>During the course of the above remarks by Hatoyama both <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> and I intervened at
                            several points to explain the American position. We stressed several
                            times the two basic principles (1) that U.S. could not agree to
                            reduction in Japan’s contribution to U.S. forces Japan except on the
                            basis of an effective increase in Japan’s own defense effort, and (2)
                            that while U.S would share cost of any increase it would not pay the
                            whole cost of such increase.</p>
                        <p>Hatoyama apparently was under the impression that mere increase in
                            numbers was what we wanted but <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General
                                Taylor</persName> pointed out that such an increase meant nothing
                            unless there were funds available for the equipping and training of
                            increased personnel. It was made clear that a soldier without a uniform
                            or a gun was not of much use. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General
                                Taylor</persName> also made clear that the only sound basis upon
                            which we could judge whether or not there was an increase in Japan’s <pb
                                n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0079"/>defense effort was the budgetary
                            criterion. It was pointed out that last year Japan spent on its own
                            forces approximately 74 billion yen and that therefore proposals which
                            had so far been made to us by the Japanese did not indicate, in our
                            opinion, an increase of 20 billion yen but at most an increase of some 6
                            billion yen.</p>
                        <p>I also took occasion to point out to the Prime Minister as I had
                            previously to Foreign Minister and Finance Minister, that it is
                            important to consider what Japan is doing defense-wise in overall
                            context of American-Japan relations and that looked at from this point
                            of view Japan’s record was not good. I referred to delay on <gloss
                                target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> negotiations, treatment of
                            American traders and investors, Japan’s attitude on civil air agreement,
                            as well as several other items. Hatoyama expressed surprise at this and
                            said he had not realized what the situation was! I therefore left with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTF1">Matsumoto</persName>, who was
                            interpreting, an informal statement on these problems. <note n="3"
                                xml:id="d27fn3">Not found.</note> In closing Hatoyama again pleaded
                            for our patience and understanding and said that if we could only go
                            along with him this year every thing would be all right next year. I
                            pointed out that the U.S. had agreed to a reduction last year in Japan’s
                            defense contribution on the basis of certain promises as to future
                            performances but that the Japanese Government had unilaterally defaulted
                            on these promises and it was therefore most difficult for us to agree
                            now to anything based on future performance. I said that we would of
                            course give most careful consideration to the problem confronting the
                            Japanese Cabinet but that in my opinion it would be most unlikely that
                            the U.S. could agree to any solution which did not correspond with the
                            two principles mentioned above. While we had now come to realize that
                            there could not be a large increase in Japan’s defense effort this year,
                            we could find it extremely difficult to agree to no increase of any
                            sort.</p>
                        <p>Apparently our conversation has had some slight effect inasmuch as this
                            morning’s press stories about our interview imply for the first time
                            that government’s original hopes for cutback of 20 billion yen in
                            Japan’s defense contribution might be impossible and that not more than
                            between 6 and 10 billion yen could be expected.</p>
                        <p>However, at same time government is doing everything possible to impress
                            upon Embassy shakiness of its position and probability that if we do not
                            make great concessions Cabinet will fall. At Prime Minister’s garden
                            party for <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss> delegation yesterday
                            afternoon not only <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tani</persName> but also
                            former Career Diplomat Amau who now has no official position in
                            government, took me aside and spoke of seriousness of Cabinet’s position
                            and what a tragedy it would be if U.S. action should cause fall of
                            government. Because of crowds present it was not possible <pb n="52"
                                xml:id="pg_52" facs="0080"/>for me to make any considered reply to
                            these observations. I therefore contented myself with listening.
                            However, in my opinion if government should fall it has only itself to
                            blame.</p>
                        <p>We are now preparing further analysis of situation which I hope to
                            forward shortly. <note n="4" xml:id="d27fn4">Not further identified; no

                                    the period 1955–57. [Footnote in the source text.]</note></p>
                            <p>1. Japan’s relations with the United States will continue to be
                                heavily influenced by its dependence upon the United States for
                                economic, military, and diplomatic support; by its estimate as to
                                whether the United States will continue to demonstrate its will and
                                ability to resist Communist aggression without seriously endangering
                                Japan; by the fact that the United States is Japan’s largest foreign
                                customer and source of supply (20% of its export trade and 40% of
                                its imports); and to a lesser extent by a still substantial residue
                                of good will for the United States. Accordingly, Japan will almost
                                certainly seek to maintain its present alignment with the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>2. Japan will endeavor to reduce its dependence on the United States
                                and will seek greater freedom of international action, including
                                expanded relations with the USSR and Communist China.</p>
                            <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0082"/>
                            <p>3. Japan has the potential to assume a leading and stabilizing role
                                in Asia. It is unlikely to acquire sufficient strength to do so in
                                the next few years. The rapidity with which Japan attains such
                                strength will depend not only on its own efforts but also on the
                                nature and magnitude of United States support and assistance.</p>
                            <p>4. Japan will continue to move toward modification of the Occupation
                                reforms, particularly toward increasing centralization of
                                governmental power, but Japan will remain democratic with many
                                differences from prewar authoritarian and imperialistic
                                patterns.</p>
                            <p>5. Moderate conservative forces, which will be hampered by factional
                                differences and will tend toward greater nationalism, will probably
                                continue to dominate Japanese government and politics.
                                Left-of-center forces will probably offer stronger opposition than
                                in the past few years. The gradual revival of ultra-nationalist
                                forces will continue. A strong and effective government is not
                                likely to emerge during the next few years.</p>
                            <p>6. Although the Japanese Communist Party is not likely to gain
                                substantial parliamentary strength, it will continue to exercise an
                                important influence through its ability to aggravate popular
                                grievances, to exploit and infiltrate mass organizations and the
                                intellectual leadership of the non-Communist left, and to infiltrate
                                the government.</p>
                            <p>7. Japan does not appear to have an immediate balance of payments
                                problem, partly due to substantial though diminishing United States
                                special expenditures, and its economic position improved during
                                calendar year 1954. Over the long term, however, particularly in the
                                face of further decreases in United States special expenditures,
                                Japan faces a difficult economic situation of providing employment
                                and adequate living standards for its growing population through an
                                expansion of exports and development of its limited domestic
                                resources.</p>
                            <p>8. Japan will continue to develop its over-all defense forces at a
                                slow rate, and will seek to adjust the balance of these forces by
                                emphasizing the development of the air and naval components. Japan
                                will continue to rely upon substantial military aid from the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Basic United States
                                Interests</hi></p>
                            <p>9. The strategic location and military and industrial potential of
                                Japan are such that the security of the United States would require
                                us to fight to prevent hostile forces from gaining control of any
                                part of Japan by attack. Similarly, we would be obliged to assist
                                the Japanese Government, if necessary, to counter subversion or
                                insurrection.</p>
                            <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0083"/>
                            <p>10. United States interests would best be served by a strong Japan,
                                firmly allied with the United States, and better able to serve as a
                                counterweight to Communist China and contribute to free world
                                strength in the Far East.</p>
                            <p>11. For the present, Japan’s alignment with the United States is
                                based partly on dependence on our support. As Japan’s strength
                                grows, dependence will lessen and should be replaced by a new sense
                                of common purpose, mutual interests and working partnership. A major
                                effort must be made to persuade Japan’s dominant conservative forces
                                that the satisfaction of the nation’s economic and defense
                                requirements and desire for prestige, as well as the stability of
                                the conservative position, depend on continuing cooperation with the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>12. If a sense of mutuality does not develop as Japan’s strength
                                increases, basic United States interests with respect to Japan will
                                have to be reassessed. At present, however, it appears that a strong
                                Japan is a better risk than a weak Japan.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Basic Japanese Interests and
                                    Objectives</hi></p>
                            <p>13. Japan’s immediate objective is to strengthen its economic
                                position, with a probable long-term objective of recovering a
                                position of international influence and prestige. Japan considers
                                that increase of defense strength is of lower priority, partly
                                because it believes that its defense will be assured by the United
                                States. While political stability is desired by most Japanese, sharp
                                and persisting conflicts between rival personalities and factions
                                seriously retard its development.</p>
                            <p>14. Japan currently considers alignment with the United States and
                                cooperation with the democratic nations to be in its national
                                interest, because it believes that in this way it is more likely to
                                attain a position of international importance and economic strength
                                and because it expects that the United States will if necessary
                                defend Japan against attack.</p>
                            <p>15. At the same time, Japan believes that, within the limits of its
                                alignment with the United States and despite its historical fear of
                                Russia and strong dislike of Communism, it should seek to ease
                                friction, develop trade and broaden relations with Communist China
                                and the Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>16. Japan is beginning to display a desire for greater freedom of
                                international action. This tendency reflects a nationalist trend,
                                rooted in racial pride, a longing for national prestige and a desire
                                for greater maneuverability in the event of conflict between

                                as a major power. Accommodation of this nationalism within the

                                policy.</p>

                                    States and Japanese Interests and Objectives</hi></p>
                            <p>17. <hi rend="italic">U.S. Bases.</hi> Japan recognizes the need for
                                continued military protection by the United States. However, Japan
                                does not regard the threat of aggression against it as seriously as
                                does the United States. Consequently, while the Japanese look upon
                                U.S. bases in Japan as protection for Japan, they also regard them
                                as serving U.S. strategic interests and as dangerously exposing
                                Japan to nuclear attack in the event of war. Furthermore, Japanese
                                policy is colored by serious doubt as to whether an acceptable
                                defense of Japan is possible in the event of nuclear war.</p>
                            <p>18. <hi rend="italic">Japanese Rearmament.</hi> Partly because it
                                discounts the danger of direct aggression, Japan puts the
                                development of political stability and economic strength ahead of
                                the development of military power, and resists U.S. efforts to
                                increase total Japanese defense expenditures.</p>
                            <p>19. <hi rend="italic">Communist China.</hi> Japan’s development of
                                closer relations with the Communist bloc will probably eventually
                                cause serious friction with the United States. The Japanese believe
                                their international interests will be served through early
                                development of closer contacts and expanded trade with the Communist
                                bloc. Pressures in this direction will continue. Currently Japan is
                                restrained from going beyond certain limits by the possible effect
                                on relations with the United States and on trade with Nationalist
                                China and the Republic of Korea.</p>

                                Strength</hi></p>
                            <p>21. Japan has limited economic, political and psychological resources
                                with which to accomplish the demanding tasks of rebuilding internal
                                political strength, economic viability and defense capacity. There
                                is inevitable competition for these limited resources among social,
                                economic and defense programs. A domestic political struggle over an
                                increase in the defense forces is creating cleavages within the
                                country and weakening the political position of the conservative
                                elements. Both economic austerity and the defense program are
                                essentially unpopular with many segments of the Japanese public, and
                                require major political efforts if they are to be achieved.</p>
                            <p>22. The United States has limited capacity to influence Japanese
                                action. Our bargaining tools and resources of good will and
                                persuasion should be fully applied but carefully apportioned to
                                accomplish our objectives most effectively.</p>
                            <p>23. While the requirement for an optimum level of defense readiness
                                will continue to exist, it must be recognized that the Japanese
                                Government will in fact determine the total size and composition of
                                the military forces which Japan will support.</p>
                            <p>24. The security interests of both Japan and the United States
                                require continuing progress by the Japanese toward greater political
                                stability, economic viability and defense strength. Achievement of
                                greater conservative political stability will mean that a Japanese
                                Government can take austere and sometimes unpopular measures
                                necessary to build economic strength and defense forces. Achievement
                                of greater economic strength will mean increased resources available
                                to devote to defense purposes. The amount and timing of the build-up
                                of Japanese military forces should be related to the necessity for
                                developing political and economic stability, as well as military
                                strength, in Japan. The United States should avoid pressing the
                                Japanese to increase their military forces to the prejudice of
                                political and economic stability.</p>

                                long-run economic problem and to its ability to assume an increasing
                                role in strengthening and stabilizing Asia.</p>

                                Far East; countermeasures to be taken by Japan, the United States

                                with the USSR, but does oppose establishment of diplomatic relations
                                with Communist China and would object strongly to political
                                association by Japan with Communist nations in such actions as
                                non-aggression pacts or efforts to facilitate entry of Communist

                                possible no later than the beginning of 1956.</p>
                            <p>47. Continue to press efforts to gain Japan’s fuller association with

                            <p>48. Encourage and assist Japan to develop military forces which will
                                eventually be capable of assuming primary responsibility for the
                                defense of Japan. The amount and timing of the build-up of Japanese
                                military forces should be related to the necessity for developing
                                political and economic stability, as well as military strength, in
                                Japan. The United States should avoid pressing the Japanese to
                                increase their military forces to the prejudice of political and
                                economic stability.</p>
                            <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0088"/>
                            <p>49. Consult with the Japanese Government about the rate of Japan’s
                                defense build-up and the scope of United States military assistance,
                                in order to make a realistic appraisal of what forces Japan is
                                willing to support.</p>
                            <p>50. Based upon such an appraisal, reexamine United States goals for
                                Japanese forces and the timing for their achievement, United States
                                military assistance programs to Japan, and the deployment of United
                                States forces in the area; in order to ensure that the minimum
                                requirements for the security of Japan are met.</p>
                            <p>51. Develop with the Japanese Government a general understanding on a
                                long-range plan for the build-up of Japanese defense forces, a
                                phased withdrawal from Japan of United States forces as consistent
                                with United States and Japanese security interests, and related
                                reductions of the Japanese contribution to the support of United
                                States forces in Japan; and make such understanding public at a
                                suitable time. In such understanding, seek to obtain Japanese
                                agreement that the amounts released by any reductions in Japanese
                                contributions to the support of U.S. forces in Japan will be devoted
                                to the development of Japanese defense forces.</p>
                            <p>52. Maintain ground, naval and air facilities in Japan which, with
                                the cooperation of Japanese forces, will serve to deter or resist
                                aggression.</p>
                            <p>53. Continue to develop arrangements with Japan for coordinated
                                military planning and operations, and transfer responsibilities to
                                Japan’s defense forces as rapidly as consistent with United States
                                security interests.</p>
                            <p>54. During the present international tensions in the Far East,
                                maintain the degree of control and authority over the Ryukyu and
                                Bonin Islands now exercised pursuant to Article 3 of the Peace
                                Treaty with Japan. In the interest of good relations with Japan,
                                consider Japanese requests for fuller relations with the Ryukyu and
                                Bonin Islands in such areas as trade, cultural relations, and
                                interchange of nationals, and accede to such requests so far as
                                consistent with United States security or other interests in the
                                area.</p>
                            <p>55. Work with the Japanese Government in seeking to improve labor
                                relations involving indigenous personnel furnished to United States
                                facilities.</p>
                            <p>56. Develop with Japan a program for Japanese development of defense
                                and defense-supporting industries and support such a program by
                                offshore procurement with Defense and Mutual Security funds.</p>

                                the strength of the free nations of Asia.</p>
                            <p>58. Encourage the Japanese Government to continue and strengthen
                                appropriate measures of self-help to eliminate non-essential

                                public credit to Japan, the use of technical assistance, the use of
                                local currency proceeds of agricultural surpluses and the widening
                                of opportunities for the investment of Japanese capital.</p>
                            <p>61. Promote the expansion of Japan’s trade through United States
                                participation in programs of economic development in free Asia; give

                                upon Communist areas for essential food and raw material supplies

                                prejudiced, to help Japan to get as much as possible out of the
                                Soviet Union, and to avoid direct involvement or criticism for

                                broad objectives are to weaken Japan’s alliance with the United
                                States, to establish a mission and possibly consular offices in
                                Japan, and to get confirmation of their territorial position in the
                                Kuriles and South Sakhalin. Japan’s objectives are to relax tensions
                                with the Soviet Union, to obtain return of the Habomais and Shikotan
                                and possibly part of the Kuriles, and to develop commercial and

                                the Soviet Union will be difficult. Japan, however, is eager to
                                normalize relations with the USSR; the Hatoyama Government is
                                committed to this policy and must appear to make progress toward its
                                realization or risk loss of support to leftist elements. Japan may
                                press for a Soviet declaration of termination of war before
                                substantive talks start. The Soviet Union appears to be under no
                                pressure to reach an early agreement or to terminate the state of
                                war and will probably rely on Japanese internal pressures in order
                                to obtain concessions.</item>

                                                not part of the Kuriles. It is unlikely the Soviets
                                                will agree to this. If they should agree they may
                                                resort to some device giving them control for an
                                                indefinite period, perhaps on a theory comparable to
                                                our control over the Ryukyus and Bonins. The
                                                Japanese also would like to assert control over all
                                                or part of the Kurile Islands, probably on the
                                                theory that their renunciation of these islands in
                                                the San Francisco Treaty does not give any benefits
                                                to the Soviet Union, which did not sign the treaty,
                                                and that Japan should not be required to give up
                                                territories it did not acquire by greed or violence,

                                                will probably also claim that the words “Kurile
                                                Islands” in the Peace Treaty refer only to the
                                                “northern Kurile Islands” and do not include the two
                                                southern islands of Kunashiri and Etorofu, which
                                                historically were never under Russian
                                                sovereignty.</p>

                                                should continue to support Japan’s claim to the
                                                Habomais and Shikotan on the theory that they are
                                                not part of the Kuriles and remain part of Japan. It
                                                is our view that under the San Francisco Treaty,
                                                Japan renounced all claim to the Kuriles and South
                                                Sakhalin and that disposition of these territories
                                                is pending. The Soviet Union has attempted formally
                                                to annex them. There are strong political reasons
                                                for encourgaging Japan’s claim to at least part of
                                                the Kuriles: the Kuriles are strategically important
                                                to the free world; Japan and the Soviet Union are
                                                the only two logical contenders for the Kuriles
                                                although some form of international control is
                                                theoretically possible; continued inaction on the
                                                part of Japan and the other free nations may
                                                constitute tacit recognition of the Soviet
                                                occupation. There are also reasons why we should not
                                                seek to change the status quo: any United States
                                                action supporting Japan’s claim to the Kuriles might
                                                appear to reflect on our position under the San
                                                Francisco Treaty in the Ryukyus and might affect the
                                                status of Formosa, which Japan also renounced under
                                                the treaty; encouragement of Japanese irredentism in
                                                the north might also encourage it in the south; the
                                                hostile presence of the Soviet Union on Japan’s
                                                northern border will serve as a constant irritant in
                                                their relations. On balance, however, it would
                                                appear desirable that as a minimum we offer no
                                                objection to efforts on the part of Japan to get all
                                                or part of the Kuriles, either as part of a deal
                                                whereby Japan might recognize a valid Soviet claim
                                                to South Sakhalin (along the lines of the
                                                Japan–Russia treaty of exchange of 1875) or even on
                                                the basis of a Soviet recognition of Japan’s
                                                residual sovereignty over all or part of the
                                                Kuriles, comparable to our position in the Ryukyus
                                                and the Bonins. We should also support any proposal
                                                by Japan to refer territorial issues to the

                        <p>2741. With agreement reached on defense budget, I believe this is good
                            time to evaluate impact of negotiations on US interests in Japan.
                            Evaluation may also be helpful in Congressional presentation of Japan
                                <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> program. Negotiations brought
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">General Taylor</persName> and myself
                            into close, and often daily, contact with the top officials of the
                            Japanese Government. They were conducted in tough, tense, and
                            occasionally heated atmosphere and were quite revealing about capacities
                            Japanese Government. It is useful initially review those aspects of
                            agreement which furthered US interests here.</p>
                        <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0097"/>
                        <p>First, when the Japanese made a firm commitment to complete its part of
                            the runaway extension program during the next fiscal year, we solved
                            major defense problem with Japan and obtained opportunity for important
                            increase in <gloss target="#t_FEAF1">FEAF</gloss> capability to operate
                            against USSR-Chinese Air Forces. In past, Japanese have been willing to
                            make commitment on furnishing land for runways “in principle” but not
                            tied to specific schedule. Second, Japanese defense program has for
                            first time been given real momentum, not only this fiscal year but in
                            future. While Japanese commitment for <gloss target="#t_JFY1"
                                >JFY</gloss> 56 and thereafter is, and could be no more than, a
                            statement of intentions, it is widely viewed both by the press and
                            responsible conservative circles as first substantial commitment Japan
                            has made in post-war to strengthen its defense forces. Indicative of
                            prospect for real Japanese defense effort this year is enthusiasm and
                            optimism expressed by their top defense officials. They cite not only
                            the defense budget of 86.8 billion yen but greatly increased contract
                            authority and receipt of full carryover (about 22.7 billion yen) from
                            last year’s defense funds (they had expected to lose 10 billion yen in
                            unobligated <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 54 funds). Third, with
                            respect to future, Japanese have at last recognized publicly not only
                            need for devoting increased resources to defense but also principle that
                            this year’s yen contribution reduction will not be carried over to next
                            year and is extraordinary measure of US cooperation based upon Japanese
                            financial difficulties this year. Fourth, possibility of unilateral
                            reductions during year in defense expenditures at behest of Finance
                            Ministry is reduced considerably by positive commitment not to reduce
                            Defense Agency budget except by mutual agreement. Fifth, Japanese have
                            now recognized that development of defense industry, specifically F–86
                            and T–33 program, must be outside regular Defense Agency expenditures.
                            Sixth, we obtained restitution of 4.5 billion yen as contract
                            authorization and wiped off books unilateral violation of commitment to
                            US in way which avoided local political consequences. <note n="2"
                                xml:id="d32fn2">“Contract authorization” lay outside the defense
                                budget proper. In telegram 2678 from Tokyo, April 19, the Embassy
                                reported it had been informed by the Japanese Government that it had
                                approved, for submission to the Diet, additional contract
                                authorization for the National Defense Agency in the amount of 4.5
                                billion yen. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 794.5/4–1955) This 4.5
                                billion yen figure was not published, but formed part of the total
                                of 15.4 billion yen for contract authorization (including the F–86
                                and T–33 programs) mentioned in numbered paragraph 2 of the
                                Agreement effected by exchange of notes on August 19.</note></p>
                        <p>In addition to these benefits directly related to the defense effort, it
                            is also useful to cite other recent developments flowing at least in
                            part from defense budget negotiations. Refusal to agree to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> visit and generally tough
                            bargaining sessions proved rude awakening to Hatoyama government which
                            up to now had been inclined to pay only lip service to need for good
                            Japanese-US relations. Hatoyama personally and those around him have
                            belatedly begun to realize that <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0098"
                            />US cannot be taken for granted, that Japan is perhaps not so important
                            to US as Japanese had come to believe. There are small, but perhaps not
                            entirely transitory, signs of greater Japanese cooperation: Japanese
                            alignment with Free World at Bandung conference has been closer than we
                            would have assumed probable month ago; Communist China Trade Mission has
                            been given pretty much of cold shoulder by responsible government and
                            business circles and Murata (head of the Association to Promote Trade
                            with China) is complaining bitterly, according to informed sources,
                            about the reversal of the Japanese Government position on China trade;
                            and recently there has been far less wishful thinking about forthcoming
                            USSR-Japan negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Defense budget talks have also served as partial catalyst for increased
                            interest in conservative merger. After elections, Democrats riding on
                            Hatoyama’s personal popularity tended to overlook their essentially weak
                            Diet position. However, faced now with need for Diet approval of defense
                            arrangement, there is greater necessity for both joint Diet action with
                            liberals and preparations for subsequent merger.</p>
                        <p>There is always question of whether we could have gotten greater
                            concessions from the Hatoyama government in the defense negotiations.
                            When Japanese initially considered defense budget negotiations to be
                            held after February 27 election they hoped for compromise which would
                            keep defense budget within framework of last year’s budget of 132.7
                            billion yen. However, it is now evident that, as election campaign grew
                            in intensity, Ichimada and others in thirst for victory made public and
                            private commitments on housing, social welfare, etc. impossible to
                            fulfill unless the defense budget were cut back from 132.7 to about 120
                            billion yen. In fact, Ichimada who saw personal political advantage to
                            breaking free from US involvement in Defense Agency budget and to
                            devoting savings to social welfare purposes would have preferred to let
                            defense negotiations break down and to reduce Defense Agency budget to
                            60 billion yen with another 60 going to United States for contribution
                            and rental of facilities. This is evident from what occurred in final
                            week of negotiations. After top-level meeting on April 13 when Japanese
                            side led by Ichimada raised major objections to our proposal of April
                            11, <note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">Forwarded to the Department in telegram

                            ascertaining if we had retreated position, reported impasse negotiations
                            to Hatoyama and presented his resignation (according to <persName

                            US). Hatoyama was thus presented with alternatives of (1) accepting
                            resignation and risking fall of government (2) rejecting it and letting
                            negotiations fail or (3) rejecting it and seeking through <persName

                                38 billion yen. (Telegram 2632 from Tokyo, April 14; Department of
                                State, Central Files, 794.5/4–1455)</note> which made agreement
                            possible within 132.7 billion limit. But to obtain it they had to make
                            concessions which entail political liabilities both present and
                            future.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, even with those aspects of arrangement favorable to
                            government, most notably the 17.8 billion yen reduction in support costs
                            (for US forces which may in any event be materially reduced in <gloss
                                target="#t_USFY1">USFY</gloss> 56), government faces extremely
                            difficult task in getting Diet to approve budget. There has been
                            considerable press criticism of overall budget for lack of substantially
                            larger expenditures for social welfare. In addition liberals, whose
                            support is required, are not particularly inclined to back new defense
                            agreement. Embassy has been informed by reliable sources that some
                            liberals are privately quite critical, particularly of commitments made
                            on future defense expenditures and runway extension. Liberals plan let
                            Socialists carry burden of attack on defense agreement, while
                            concentrating their direction overall budget—although short of actually
                            forcing Cabinet resignation or Diet dissolution. Democrats are, on other
                            hand, not in strong position to defend arrangement. My negotiations with
                            top Cabinet officials left me with impression of complete lack of
                            coordination, and often lack of knowledge, on part of top Ministers.
                            Ichimada’s dissatisfaction with agreement has already been mentioned
                            (Alsop told me he had heard Ichimada still annoyed with me for
                            discomfiting him on campaign pledges and hence his own ambition).
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> threatened with
                            non-confidence motion. And finally Hatoyama lacks knowledge and physical
                            strength to make dynamic fight in defense of budget.</p>
                        <p>In view above, arrangement negotiated seems best we could reasonably
                            expect from weak government. Had we pushed Japanese government farther I
                            was convinced, even before we began to get confirmation from Japanese
                            sources, it would have led to Cabinet’s fall. Cabinet collapse would not
                            have been consistent with policy set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> paper (paras 24 &amp; 48).<note n="5" xml:id="d32fn5"

                            fell, it would have been perhaps months before we would have negotiated

                        <p>Such arrangement likely to have provided for minimum defense effort on
                            part of Japan, and in any event arrangement far less satisfactory than
                            was agreed. Finally there was always possibility that fall of Hatoyama
                            might lead shortly to socialist government which could be expected to
                            deemphasize defense efforts.</p>

                            our relations and strong undercurrent of criticism about US
                            interference—specifically inability sovereign Japanese Government to
                            reach decisions on budget or even to submit any budget to their
                            legislature [without?] lengthy negotiations with US. Japanese believe
                            that root of problem is provisions Article 25 Administrative Agreement
                            which require such bilateral consultations prior to government decisions
                            on budget. Japanese feel that provisions for contribution to US forces
                            are special obligation imposed only on former occupied areas, i.e. Japan
                            and Germany and are therefore carryover from the occupation period.
                            Already half a dozen Japanese bureaucrats (including Foreign Vice
                            Minister Kadowaki) have told Embassy officers that for sake of future
                            US-Japanese relations we must never have repetition of this year’s
                            negotiation. There is distinct possibility that this attitude will lead
                            to demand for revision of Article 25.</p>
                        <p>If this can be done without real cost to US it may well be desirable
                            since I feel that US-Japanese relations cannot stand too many more of
                            these annual defense negotiations. We have annual budget review with
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries but there the
                            background and history of voluntary partnership is altogether different
                            to say nothing of multilateral framework of discussions and radically
                            different circumstances in Europe and Far East. In view of my concern
                            and in light paragraph 51 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper,
                            I have therefore asked my staff to look into the question of alternative
                            arrangements which protect US interests and are, at the same time,
                            conducive to more mutually beneficial discussions on the defense
                            question. I believe that this is subject which rates Washington
                            consideration and help.<note n="6" xml:id="d32fn6"><persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> called at his own
                            request on the Secretary at 4:30 p.m. on June 21. His purpose was to
                            continue their private, informal, wide ranging exchange of views.</p>
                        <p>There was considerable discussion of Japan and its position. The
                            Secretary expressed his disappointment at the failure of the Japanese to
                            pull themselves together for a role of greatness as the Germans were
                            doing under Adenauer. In earlier years the rivalries of Russia, China
                            and Japan maintained an uneasy equilibrium of power in the Asian
                            mainland. Now with Russia and China allied and Japan inert and lacking
                            power, the United States had to maintain more military power in the
                            Pacific area than it would otherwise choose. Were we to withdraw, one
                            could look for a substantial expansion of Communist power throughout the
                            Far East. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> agreed. He
                            raised the difficult economic problem of Japan and suggested that its
                            natural markets might lie in China. The Secretary pointed out that
                            historically Japan’s trade with mainland China had been relatively
                            limited and suggested that the most profitable outlets for Japan lay in
                            Southeast Asia. In these countries, however, the memories of the
                            Japanese occupation were bitter which complicated the development of
                            trade. There was some discussion of the problem that Japan constituted
                            for both Great Britain and the United States rising from its entry into
                            our markets with low-cost, inferior manufactured goods.</p>

                                Tokyo, July 9, that the contents, if used publicly, should not be
                                attributed to the United States. “We are concerned Japanese make and
                                support their own case without possibility shifting on us failure
                                negotiations to U.S. ‘Interface’ in talks.” The United States was,
                                however, prepared to indicate support of a Japanese public position
                                based on the substance of the aide-mémoire. (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>I called Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> July 18
                            and advised him that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"

                                Radford</persName> had talked with me about it; that State had
                            agreed to the move in principle; but it would have to be handled with
                            extreme delicacy in Japan. We all recognized that the reduction should
                            be kept in complete confidence at the present time. Our Embassy and
                            military in Tokyo were being consulted on the best method of handling it
                            with the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that the publicity out of Washington, before we had had a
                            chance to advise the Japanese Government, would make the task more
                            difficult. I also stated that there might be repercussions in <pb n="76"

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he had
                            been guided primarily by budgetary considerations in making the
                            announcement.</p>
                        <p>I promised to keep him advised of progress in our conversations with the
                            Japanese, and hoped that no further announcements or amplification would
                            be forthcoming until we reached a later stage.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bob</hi>: I appreciated receiving the
                            information on <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                            Lemnitzer</persName>’s cable C–73002 of June 19 <note n="2"
                                xml:id="d36fn2">Not printed.</note> regarding his recommendation to
                            retain installations in Japan for two divisions even after the ground
                            forces are re-deployed. As you surmised, the cable was not brought to
                            the attention of the Embassy by the Command.</p>
                        <p>I wonder what the status of this recommendation is in view of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s announcement at

                            surprising (and confusing) the Command as well as ourselves. (I would
                            gather that you, too, had no previous warning.) In fact, Jeff <note

                            Rogers that the Command, on instructions from <gloss target="#t_DA1"
                                >DA</gloss>, and despite Presidential approval of redeployment
                            plans, has been working on alternative redeployment plans involving the
                            retention of some ground forces units in Japan, in addition to the
                            airborne RCT. The fact that this planning has been going on was not
                            disclosed to us until today and then only in the context of clearing
                            Embtel 151. <note n="4" xml:id="d36fn4">Telegram 151, July 19, reported
                                on the impact in Japan of the redeployment decision and on the

                                representatives. (Department of State, Central Files,

                            mention <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName>’s plan
                            to retain installation here if the ground forces are eventually pulled
                            out.</p>
                        <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0105"/>
                        <p>Our hunch is that, if the Army fails—as is apparent—to gain a reversal of
                            the redeployment decision, it will drive hard for a compromise
                            permitting it to retain bases here on the contingency that by <gloss
                                target="#t_USFY1">USFY</gloss> ‘57 circumstances will permit it to
                            bring back from Korea all or part of the ground forces now stationed
                            there. Since this plan may appear attractive both from certain military
                            considerations and as a bureaucratic compromise to appease the Army, I
                            am afraid the Pentagon may be inclined to go along with <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName>’s recommendation.
                            This would be most regrettable since, in effect, the Japanese would be
                            asked to make the major sacrifices in order to satisfy the conflicting
                            “appetites” of our military. It is most unrealistic to assume that the
                            Japanese will docilely agree to our retention of “idle bases” for a
                            rainy day; on the contrary, the Japanese would increasingly insist that
                            bases here must serve Japanese interests only, i.e. not U.S. purposes
                            only indirectly concerned with the defense of the Japanese homeland. The
                            continual land hunger of the Japanese opens such a policy to vigorous
                            and widespread criticism. Renewed vigor in the Japanese drive to
                            contract our facilities has also resulted from the runway extension
                            program. As noted in our telegram 152, <note n="5" xml:id="d36fn5">Dated
                                July 19, not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note> the
                            government is on the brink of a major effort, for face-saving purposes,
                            to secure return of all unused facilities.</p>
                        <p>I think we must face up to the fact that in general the trend is
                            definitely in the direction of restricting, rather than broadening, U.S.
                            rights and bases in Japan. While the government will probably carry
                            through on its commitment on the runways, it is likely to be very
                            resistant toward any more such commitments or any base policies which
                            promise to arouse public criticism. Furthermore, any effort we make to
                            fight this trend head on by insisting on our “rights” is not likely to
                            be successful and can only result in further aggravating our current
                            relations with Japan to the detriment of our long-term base position
                            here.</p>
                        <p>In view of <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName>’s
                            position on this issue, I do not believe that there is much possibility
                            for pressure from Tokyo to block his plan to retain facilities. Although
                            we will contribute any items which might be helpful, it would appear
                            that the burden of this issue falls on you in your contacts with OSD
                            which, I would hope, could be backed up in the weekly meetings between
                            State and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. Let us know if we can

                                Defense Treaty with the United States to replace the present

                        </list>
                        <p>This proposal is summarized in Tab A. It is a proposal which has been in
                            the wind for a long time and directly and indirectly has been mentioned
                            to us and to the Embassy in Japan informally over the last two years by
                            Japanese government officials, Diet members and private citizens.
                            Japanese Socialists and Conservatives alike have expressed themselves
                            either publicly or privately or both as believing that the present
                            treaty is unequal and that it should be revised. In my view we can, if
                            necessary, maintain the present arrangements with Japan for some little
                            time to come. But the pressure for modification of the arrangements will
                            continue to arise. We should therefore consider seriously whether it is
                            to our interest to explore secretly with the Japanese at this time the
                            possibility of a mutual defense treaty. Some of the factors which need
                            to be considered are: <list>

                                <item>Our present rights are wider than any we can possibly get.
                                    However, Tokyo’s 201 points out that to some extent these rights
                                    are illusory, as has been evidenced in the recent difficulties

                                    Government is strong enough to get a treaty of this sort through
                                    the Diet. Certainly before any public indication that such a

                                    Liberals and Democrats in Japan would unite to support the

                                    mutual defense, they already have an authorized strength of
                                    193,000 men in the armed forces, as compared with less than
                                    100,000 for the Philippines. And the present Japanese Government
                                    is committed to a series of further increases over the next few

                                    have told the Russians that they do not intend to break their

                                    highly useful to us and a serious blow to Russian objectives in
                                    the Far East if the Japanese were in the relatively near future
                                    to go beyond the present security treaty and commit themselves
                                    to a mutual defense arrangement with us.</item>

                                TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES TO REPLACE PRESENT SECURITY TREATY
                                    <note n="5" xml:id="d37fn5">Top Secret.</note></p>
                            <p>The basic treaty would consist of mutual defense provisions like
                                those of the Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines or the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> treaty. The treaty would
                                be valid for 25 years in order to cope with the Soviet-Communist
                                Chinese alliance which runs until 1980. It would be renewable every
                                five years thereafter.</p>
                            <p>In addition, certain supplementary arrangements or agreements would
                                be involved:</p>
                            <p>1. Transitional arrangements for the withdrawal of United States
                                ground forces within six years.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This is in accord with present <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy which provides for “a phased
                                withdrawal from Japan of United States forces as consistent with
                                United States and Japanese security interests”. (Paragraph <pb
                                    n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0108"/>51, Tab B) The difficult
                                problem would be for us to retain the right—if Defense considered it
                                necessary or desirable to do so—to send our forces back in in case
                                of emergency.</p>
                            <p>2. Mutual agreement on the date of withdrawal of United States air
                                and naval forces, but at the latest six years after completion of
                                the withdrawal of the ground forces.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> General thinking here had been that
                                United States air and naval bases would be retained in Japan
                                indefinitely. Subject to advice from Defense, this is a point on
                                which we would want a good deal more favorable arrangements than
                                contained in this Japanese proposal.</p>
                            <p>3. United States bases in Japan and United States forces there to be
                                utilized for mutual defense purposes only, under arrangements
                                similar to those with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                countries.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The explicit limitation on the use of
                                the bases which the present security treaty allows us to use “to
                                contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security in
                                the Far East” is clearly undesirable.</p>
                            <p>4. No further Japanese contribution to the support of United States
                                forces in Japan.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Paragraph 51 of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper (see Tab B) provides that we
                                should accept reductions of the Japanese contribution in relation to
                                the buildup of the Japanese defense forces and the withdrawal of our
                                own forces. Here it would probably be possible to negotiate a
                                specific phased reduction over a period of years which would avoid
                                the annual wrangle about the Japanese defense budget. We could also
                                probably set some understanding that the amounts thus released would
                                be devoted to the development of the Japanese defense forces.</p>

                                regard to deployment of atomic-capable weapons in Japan and Okinawa.

                                    be paroled by April 1956; (3) a Soviet promise at the London
                                    talks between the Soviet Union and Japan to release war
                                    criminals in its custody following normalization of relations:
                                    (4) the policy on the question set forth in <gloss
                                        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5516/1; and (5) the

                                Japanese war criminals subject to our control be reduced to a hard
                                core of approximately 50 by the end of the year by expediting
                                present procedures of the Clemency and Parole Board or, failing in
                                this, that you authorize a recommendation to the President for mass
                                parole to the desired level. There are presently 210 Japanese war
                                criminals subject to United States jurisdiction as opposed to 66
                                Germans. The alternative to these recommendations is to maintain
                                present procedures which will delay the elimination of this issue
                                for more than two years but will maintain judicial forms.</item>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> explained that the
                            purpose of the meeting was to prepare US positions for the three
                            business sessions with the Japanese Delegation, headed by Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>. He noted that
                            the Japanese representation was complicated by questions of Japanese
                            domestic politics, i.e., Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            would in fact be a representative of the Japanese Democratic Party, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTF1">Matsumoto</persName>, the personal
                            representative of Prime Minister Hatoyama, and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> would play a more <pb n="85"

                                xml:id="d42fn2"><p><persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>
                                    submitted a lengthy evaluation of <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                        >Shigemitsu</persName>’s political standing in telegram 409
                                    from Tokyo, August 12. He commented on the visit as follows:</p>
                                <p>“On Japanese side, <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                        >Shigemitsu</persName> visit to Washington is primarily
                                    internal political move, which he hopes will better his personal
                                    chances here, and which some other politicians support as means
                                    of bolstering position of Hatoyama and Democratic Party. This
                                    political ambition largely explains timing of visits by
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> and <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to overlap <persName
                                        corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>’s. Various
                                    individuals and cliques want to keep eye on each other, prevent
                                    rivals from monopolizing any political gains which may result
                                    from Washington talks. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                        >Shigemitsu</persName> visit, however, will also of course
                                    be intended at same time to serve Japanese foreign policy
                                    purposes, which he sincerely pursues except where his personal
                                    ambitions conflict.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central
                                    Files, 033.9411/8–1255)</p></note> We had, however, instructed
                            Tokyo to inform Hatoyama that <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> as head of the delegation would decide who
                            attended meetings.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary raised the question of the necessity of translation
                            facilities and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>
                            indicated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> was
                            able to conduct negotiations in English and that in any case he would
                            have <persName corresp="#p_MTF1">Frank Matsumoto</persName>, fluent in
                            English, along with him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1"
                                >Sebald</persName> said he wanted to avoid point-by-point
                            translation in Japanese.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Agenda</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> pointed out that it had
                            not been felt necessary to prepare briefing papers for the Secretary on
                            the results of the Geneva meeting and on the Ambassadorial talks with
                            the Chinese or on the October Foreign Ministers meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJ1">McClurkin</persName> stated that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> would like to
                            receive from the Secretary a general picture of the world situation with
                            emphasis on the Far East and in turn would give his views based
                            particularly on his long experience in China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> stated that an informal
                            agenda had been prepared based on several exchanges of cables with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>, although
                            there was no final agreement with the Japanese on the agenda. The talks
                            would probably afford an opportunity to draw out the Japanese on several
                            issues including relations with the USSR and Red China trade.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about Mr. <persName>Kase</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">Ambassador Toshikazu Kase, Permanent
                                Observer at the United Nations.</note> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> indicated that he was the right
                            hand man to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> and that
                            the Secretary had seen him recently prior to Kase’s going to New York as
                            Japanese Observer to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Mutual Security Treaty</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary posed the question of our negotiating a mutual security
                            treaty with the Japanese, perhaps superimposing it on the present
                            security treaty.</p>
                        <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0114"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> stressed the
                            overwhelming desire of the Japanese to get American troops out of their
                            country. He also stated that it was very doubtful that the present
                            government had the strength to accede to a mutual defense type of
                            agreement unless they could obtain a politically attractive quid pro
                            quo.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that a U.S. obligation to defend Japan would meet
                            this point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> stated that the
                            Japanese believe that in practice they already have this, or at least do
                            not appreciate the lack of such an obligation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJ1">McClurkin</persName> stressed the
                            inadvisability of unnecessarily reopening negotiations on the status of
                            forces agreement under which we had our bases rights.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName> noted that under
                            this agreement we had the right to dispose an unlimited number of troops
                            in Japan—a situation which did not obtain in Korea or in the Philippines
                            where consultation was required. This right to consult might provide a
                            bargaining point with the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJ1">McClurkin</persName> noted the recent
                            campaign by Minister of Defense <persName corresp="#p_SS2"
                                >Sunada</persName>, for Japanese rearmament and US withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FRB1">Finn</persName> stated that at one point
                            (1950) there were 185,000 troops in Japan, that there were now
                            approximately 113,000 and that the figure would be cut to 76,000 in the
                            next twelve months. This figure included Air and Navy as well as
                            Army.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJ1">McClurkin</persName> added that the
                            reduction for the next twelve months did not include a cut in air and
                            naval forces and that the Japanese envisaged our retaining air and navy
                            bases after the departure of US land forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FRB1">Finn</persName> stated that the Japanese
                            probably would contemplate limiting their commitments under any mutual
                            defense agreement to Japan and to the US territories in the West Pacific
                            excluding Korea and Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that this was a step forward in that we at
                            present have no commitments at all from the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FRB1">Finn</persName> indicated that the
                            Japanese had made it clear to Embassy officials that in event of a new
                            outbreak of hostilities in Korea or fighting on Formosa the Japanese
                            would not consider themselves bound to afford us the use of our bases
                            and that a new exchange of notes similar to that undertaken in 1951
                            would be required. <note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">Reference is to the
                                exchange of notes on September 8, 1951; see <ref target="#d8fn4"

                        <p>The Secretary noted that the 1951 exchange of notes had to do not with US
                            uses of Japanese bases but their use by <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> forces; that the Japanese had no jurisdictional basis
                            for questioning our use of the bases, regardless of what political
                            interpretation they might choose to put on the agreement.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> stressed the importance
                            of the defense aspects of the visit and the need to reach an
                            understanding with the Japanese on the reduction of our forces and a
                            concomitant reduction in the Japanese financial contribution.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether it was clear that the Japanese wanted the
                            withdrawal of American forces in Japan, stressing the importance of
                            these forces as a source of dollars.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName> estimated that 500
                            million dollars had reached the Japanese economy by this means last year
                            but that the sum would be smaller this year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJ1">McClurkin</persName> noted that the
                            Japanese have not asked for reduction in either air or naval forces.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that a basic question was whether the Hatoyama
                            Government was strong enough that we wished, by concessions in
                            forthcoming negotiations, to give it a political livelihood. If it was
                            likely to fall in the near future, there was no point in using up our
                            ammunition only to face a later government which would simply raise the
                            ante. It might be desirable to play our cards close to the chest as we
                            had done with <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> estimated <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>’s political future as most
                            doubtful as well as that of Hatoyama himself. He thought there would be
                            no harm in a commitment to sit down and talk over matters in the near
                            future. Our real problem was the annual negotiations on the Japanese
                            contribution to defense costs. The negotiations last year had put an
                            unbearable strain on Japanese-US relations, almost bringing down the
                            Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName>, noting that the
                            Hatoyama Government was following the same policies on defense as had
                            the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> Government, stated
                            that our aim should be a three or four year schedule of payments to be
                            negotiated between now and November. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJ1"
                                >McClurkin</persName> noted that the present Japanese contribution
                            was $105,000,000.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if an agreement of this sort would be honored by
                            subsequent Japanese Governments. He suggested that the Japanese have not
                            made up their minds what their future role in the Far East should be and
                            that they are presently operating on a very short term basis seeking
                            maximum concessions on each issue.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJ1">McClurkin</persName> stated that an

                            policy and intent relating to Japanese contribution, the size of
                            American forces and the magnitude of Japan’s own defense

                        <p>The Secretary asked if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> would raise the question of war criminals. He
                            noted that there was a split position within the Department and that the
                            issue as presented was too complicated to decide at the briefing
                            session.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> stressed the overriding
                            importance of political considerations and the invidious comparison
                            between the number of Japanese still in prison and the number of Germans
                            similarly held.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary characterized the comparison of numbers as a stick with
                            which to beat the dog. The real political issue was not whether there
                            were 150 or 50 prisoners still in Sugamo but whether there were any at
                            all and the impression abroad that this constituted an example of the
                            victor imposing his will on the vanquished. The Secretary also said he
                            did not see why the problem of Japanese war criminals should be
                            necessarily tied to that of the Germans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary raised the possibility of turning the remaining prisoners
                            over to the Japanese Government for handling on their own
                            responsibility. The Japanese actions would thus of course be subject to
                            judgment by world opinion.</p>

                            in the attached radio are essentially that Hatoyama has authorized the
                            release of much important information on Japanese defense planning in
                            order to help <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> in
                            Washington and that this attitude indicates that the time is propitious
                            for the United States to press the Japanese for two important
                            understandings: (1) Assurance that Japan will continue to develop its
                            ground forces beyond the 180,000 level now planned including sufficient
                            supporting forces and (2) recognition by Japan that the United States
                            must retain air, naval and ground-logistical bases in Japan on a
                            long-term basis.</p>
                        <p>The favorable developments cited by <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> are Hatoyama’s declaration that he hopes
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> can gain the
                            confidence of the United States regarding Japan’s long-term defense
                            program and a number of statements by Japan’s new Minister in Charge of
                            Defense, <persName corresp="#p_SS2">Sunada</persName>, to the effect
                            that a six-year defense plan calling for build-up of ground forces to
                            180,000 within three years on condition of “withdrawal of United States
                            Security Forces in Japan” has been approved, that Japan should spend
                            about 15 billion yen more each year on defense, and that the Defense
                            Agency should be elevated to the level of a Ministry.</p>

                                willing to make at this time. To get a Japanese assurance now that
                                it will develop beyond 180,000 is highly unrealistic, although I
                                believe we may be able to get such an assurance in several years if
                                the climate in Japan continues to improve.</item>

                            <item>Japan’s six-year plan is being formulated largely on the
                                assumption that it will pave the way for withdrawal first of our
                                ground forces and later of our air and naval forces. It will,
                                therefore, be difficult to persuade the Japanese of the necessity of
                                our retaining air, naval and particularly ground-logistical bases on
                                a long-term basis. Our long-term needs in Japan, especially for
                                ground force installations, require careful study.</item>

                                paying off and that we should allow the climate in Japan to continue
                                to improve before we press for a better Japanese effort.</item>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that he had been looking forward to meeting
                            the Secretary personally and that this meeting would give him real
                            pleasure. He noted that the Secretary had been the principal architect
                            of the friendly relations now existing between the United States and
                            Japan and said that on behalf of the people of Japan he wished to
                            express lasting gratitude.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed pleasure at the opportunity of meeting the
                            Foreign Minister and his associates, adding that he is always interested
                            to meet friends from Japan because he takes a lively interest in
                            Japanese matters as a result of having worked to bring about the Treaty
                            of Peace. He commented that the Treaty is unique for its spirit of
                            reconciliation and absence of vengefulness. The Secretary said that the
                            United States desired a treaty of this sort because of its high regard
                            for Japan’s potential as a great nation able to exert a constructive
                            influence. He observed that despite small differences wide areas of
                            agreement exist between Japan and the United States and that each
                            respects the motives and purposes of the other.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that during the morning he had talked on the telephone
                            with the President, who had asked him to convey his regards to the
                            Foreign Minister and to the people of Japan, had expressed regret that
                            he could not be present and had asked the Secretary to convey his hope
                            that the discussions would help promote even better and closer relations
                            in the future.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then read a general statement summarizing points he
                            desired to discuss. A copy of this statement is attached. <note n="2"

                        <p>The Secretary said he would like to make some general observations in

                            of Soviet policies and not because of their success. The Soviets had for
                            ten years tried to overrun Europe and Asia by tough tactics. They had
                            had some initial successes in Europe due to the presence of their
                            occupation troops and had had a considerable success in China. Their
                            policies had recently met reverses and after the death of Stalin they
                            considered a change of policy. For several years there was a division in
                            Soviet thinking as to how to proceed. They had continued their tough
                            policies in an effort to frustrate the entry of the Federal Republic of
                            Germany into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and had used every
                            means short of war. With the failure of these efforts they took a series
                            of steps which had clearly been prepared in advance: they signed the
                            Austrian Peace Treaty; they made peace with Tito despite their seven
                            years of threatening and abusing him; they submitted a disarmament
                            proposal on May 10 at variance with their previous position and partly
                            accepting the position of the Western Powers; they invited Adenauer, who
                            they had previously treated as an outcast, to go to Moscow; they
                            proposed the peace negotiations with Japan; and they issued new orders
                            of the day requiring their representatives to be all smiles and
                            cordiality. Their internal situation has also been causing the Soviet
                            leaders concern: they had been placing an almost intolerable burden on
                            their people by devoting such a large proportion of their efforts to
                            military expansion and capital development. Modern armament is very
                            costly, and on the basis of comparative economic strength the USSR would
                            have to spend each year about $150 billion for military activity to
                            equal the United States effort. This burden is very heavy even for a
                            police state, and as Stalin had said the Communist nations occasionally
                            need a respite.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the free nations are willing to give the
                            Communists a respite but on a very provisional basis. The Soviets have
                            not yet paid the price to end the Cold War, and Geneva was not <pb
                                n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0120"/>the end of a period but merely
                            the beginning. The spirit of Geneva must be injected into a number of
                            other situations, such as the unification of Germany, the Soviet
                            treatment of the satellite nations, its efforts to spread international
                            communism, and its attitude toward inspection in the interest of
                            disarmament, before the spirit becomes really genuine. The meetings of
                            the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee now starting in New York
                                <note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4">For documentation, see <ref

                            will be one test of the spirit of Geneva, and the Foreign Ministers’
                            meeting in October will provide a fuller test.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Disarmament.</hi> The Secretary said he did not propose
                            to go in to a full review of the European situation but believed a
                            discussion of disarmament would be useful. The United States believes
                            today that a system of inspection and control can provide an effective
                            step toward disarmament. The greatest insurance against a major war is
                            the capacity of the free nations for retaliation, since a nation
                            starting a war will itself suffer grievous damage through the other
                            side’s power to retaliate. The United States has the capacity for
                            retaliation largely because of its supremacy in the atomic field and
                            because of its agreements with friendly nations for the maintenance of
                            air bases available to strike the Soviet Union. The danger exists that
                            the Soviet Union can develop a powerful atomic capability and through a
                            surprise attack destroy the capacity of the free nations to retaliate.
                            It is unlikely that the Soviet Union can catch up to the United States
                            in the development of atomic weapons, but they may be able to develop a
                            capacity for a surprise attack which could destroy any effort at
                            retaliation. The United States believes that inspection, particularly
                            aerial inspection and some ground inspection, could provide knowledge of
                            the build-up for an attack of this magnitude and thus eliminate the
                            possibility of an attack which could wipe out our retaliatory power.
                            Thus our deterrent to such an attack would remain. This is the approach
                            which the United States is taking at the United Nations Disarmament
                            Subcommittee, and it will be interesting to see whether the Soviet Union
                            will agree.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he realized that the issue of atomic weapons is very
                            important and sensitive in Japan. He commented that atomic weapons are
                            here to stay and that even if it were possible to abolish them, as the
                            Soviet Union would like to do, it is doubtful whether abolition would be
                            desirable from the point of view of the free nations, although we hope
                            their use can be prevented. But if atomic weapons were banned, the chief
                            deterrent against Communist aggression would vanish. The United States
                            itself might not be so easily attacked in such a situation, but
                            countries more readily accessible to vast Soviet land armies would be in
                            great danger.</p>
                        <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0121"/>
                        <p>The Secretary added that developments in the field of atomic science now
                            make it impossible to prevent the development of atomic weapons, since
                            fissionable material necessary for weapons is developed even through
                            ordinary peaceful uses of atomic energy. Abolition of atomic weapons is
                            thus not feasible. The key to disarmament is primarily one of preventing
                            a surprise attack. If the danger of a surprise attack can be diminished,
                            reduction of armaments may follow.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Communist China.</hi> The United States does not
                            believe that the policies of Communist China are such as to entitle it
                            to a seat in the United Nations or to recognition by the United States.
                            This is not because the mainland government is Communist, since the
                            United States has relations with a number of Communist countries. The
                            Communist regime in China came into being through force and still
                            believes in the use of force in its international relations.
                            Consequently we believe that anything the United States might do to
                            enhance the power or prestige of Communist China would be against our
                            interests. The Communist revolution in China was a more extensive one in
                            time than the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. The Chinese Communists
                            have consistently resorted to force—in Korea, and in Indochina, and they
                            had intended to seize Formosa by force. To meet the Communist threat to
                            Indochina the United States had proposed a multilateral security treaty
                            to certain of the nations directly concerned in Southeast Asia. The
                            French and the United Kingdom, however, felt that the Geneva Conference
                            on an armistice should take place first and be followed by a Security
                            Treaty. The Manila Pact was concluded just about one year ago and has
                            contributed measurably to peace and order in Asia even though conditions
                            are still far from ideal. The Communists then shifted their interests
                            from Indochina to Taiwan, and the United States took strong measures of
                            its own including a Mutual Security Treaty with the Republic of China
                            covering Taiwan and the Pescadores and a joint resolution by the
                            Congress with only three dissenting votes in each House authorizing the
                            President to use force if he deemed it necessary for the defense of
                            Taiwan, the Pescadores or related areas. The Secretary commented that he
                            had felt at that time that the chances of war were even, but he had
                            believed that the chance had to be taken since failure to stand up to
                            the Communists would have been most unfortunate.</p>

                            which Japan had attended, the United States urged friendly governments
                            to press upon the Chinese Communists the danger of their pursuing
                            forceful means. Bandung had had a very wholesome influence on the
                            Communists in persuading them that the nations of Asia would not support
                            their use of force. <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0122"/><persName

                            the United States, and the Secretary had replied that the United States
                            was prepared to talk on matters of direct concern to the two governments
                            but not on matters involving third countries. For several months various
                            intermediaries stepped in, but the United States was not satisfied as to
                            the motives and reliability of some of these intermediaries. The United
                            States, therefore, started direct talks with the Chinese Communists at
                            Geneva one month ago on the subject of repatriation of civilians, but
                            unfortunately there had not been much progress. The Chinese Communists
                            are not certain whether their interests are served by giving up the
                            American civilians they hold or by keeping them as hostages. In response
                            to the Foreign Minister’s question the Secretary said the Chinese are
                            holding 41 or 42, mostly in jail or under ignominious conditions, not
                            counting turncoats whose return the United States does not want.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had recently been expounding at his press
                            conferences and elsewhere the doctrine of non-use of force. He said he
                            thinks the Chinese Communists now realize it will be futile to use force
                            to attempt to unify Korea. Although the status of Formosa has not been
                            decided, there are a number of other divided countries such as Korea and
                            Germany, and the important thing is to get acceptance of the doctrine of
                            non-use of force. The only way to get countries like Communist China to
                            adopt a more acceptable way of international life is to use methods
                            which will bring them around to this. There have been two conflicting
                            views on how to treat Communist China—either to bring it into the United
                            Nations in the hope that it will behave better or to keep it out until
                            it does behave better. The United States believes in the latter theory.
                            The United Nations Charter was drafted in 1945 in such a way as to
                            impose certain requirements on nations entering the United Nations, and
                            although some mistakes may have been made in 1945 in allowing certain
                            countries to enter the United Nations, the requirements of the Charter
                            should be maintained.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said in summary that the policies of the United States are
                            to give support to non-Communist countries, to be prepared if necessary
                            to fight if these countries are attacked, to give these countries
                            economic aid and assistance as needed, and to seek to bring about
                            changes in the character and attitude of the Communist countries. The
                            Secretary said that he believed some progress was being made but that
                            progress requires the free nations to stand firm and solid and to make
                            it clear to the Communist nations that they must change their
                            policies.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Role of Japan.</hi> The Secretary said that the United
                            States, although it has permanent interests in the Western Pacific, is
                            not an Asian power while Japan is an Asian power and a very great one.
                            It would be normal if Japan were exerting a greater influence and the
                            United States <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0123"/>were exerting less
                            influence in Asia. The United States does not desire to act as a sort of
                            balance-of-power in Asia. Japan should do this and the United States
                            would be happier in this event. Some nations feel the United States is
                            exerting itself in various parts of the world out of ambition but the
                            idea of aggrandizement does not for a moment enter into the thinking of
                            the United States. The United States does not stand in the way of any
                            nation desiring to exercise a constructive role. The Secretary stressed
                            that he has always sought to accelerate the time when Japan would use
                            its potential influence in Asia in a healthy way.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that this is the objective of his Government
                            and that this is the duty and responsibility of Japan.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Japan’s negotiations with the Soviet Union.</hi> In
                            reply to the Secretary’s question, the Foreign Minister said that these
                            talks were not making much progress. The Foreign Minister handed the
                            Secretary a prepared paper summarizing the positions of Japan and the
                            Soviet Union (copy attached). <note n="6" xml:id="d44fn6"
                                >“Japanese-Soviet Negotiations”, dated August 29, not
                                printed.</note> The Secretary noted a reference in the Japanese
                            paper to the Kuriles and South Sakhalin <note n="7" xml:id="d44fn7">In
                                the paper, Japan contended that there were no international
                                instruments that provided for the transfer of Japan’s title to the
                                Kuriles and/or South Sakhalin to the Soviet Union.</note> and
                            commented that he had inserted a provision into the Japanese Peace
                            Treaty (Article 25) stating that no right, title, or interest of Japan
                            shall be deemed to diminished or prejudiced by any provision of the
                            Treaty in favor of a state which did not sign it. This provision had
                            been inserted to insure that nonsignatories did not get any advantage
                            from the Treaty. The Secretary noted that all of Japan’s detainees in
                            the Soviet Union were also alleged to be in prison and commented that
                            this was a favorite Communist device. The Secretary observed that it
                            looked as if Japan’s negotiations with the Soviet Union had a long way
                            to go and said he thought Japan is handling the talks very well. He
                            observed that on the basis of his experience very little is achieved by
                            making concessions to the Soviets on small points. Soviet leaders decide
                            on the basis of fundamental considerations whether they want an
                            agreement or not, and their attitude is not influenced by minor
                            concessions. The negotiations of the Western Powers with Austria was a
                            clear illustration of the Soviet method. The Foreign Minister asked the
                            Secretary whether he thought the Soviets wanted a treaty with Japan. The
                            Secretary replied yes and said he thought the Soviets would make some
                            concessions to get it, adding that they would probably attempt to tire
                            the Japanese out.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Domestic Political Situation in Japan.</hi> The Foreign
                            Minister stressed the determination of his Government to construct a new
                            Japan and to build up his country in a proper way. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> are working hard for the unification of the
                            constructive forces in Japan, <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0124"
                            />realizing that internal and external politics have a close connection.
                            The Government has also developed a six-year economic plan and a
                            six-year defense plan, but to realize these plans the Government will
                            need unified forces within Japan and a thorough understanding with us.
                            The Secretary commented that it seems to us, looking at it from the
                            outside and not wanting at all to interfere in a Japanese domestic
                            problem, that it is necessary to draw together the Conservative forces
                            within Japan and to develop unity of action. He hoped that steps in this
                            direction could be taken and would soon succeed. At the Foreign
                            Minister’s request <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> stated
                            that the general policies Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> had been describing were not only the
                            viewpoints of the Hatoyama Government but of all the conservative groups
                            in Japan. Therefore a consolidation of these forces was desirable in
                            order to make it possible to bring about the desired goals. Mr. Hatoyama
                            agrees. He and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> were
                            working with the Liberals to try to accomplish this unification. The
                            Secretary said that if there were a solidly unified Government within
                            Japan it might be easier for us to act when we are asked to do something
                            to help. Now it seems we are often asked to do things which will help
                            one Government or one individual stay in power and we find difficulty in
                            meeting such requests. If the Japanese could unify their Government it
                            would undoubtedly be found much easier to get along with us. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> responded that that
                            was exactly the job that they are trying to do.</p>

                            read a prepared statement on this subject (copy attached). <note n="3"

                                    text</hi>] was not declassified.</note> The Foreign Minister
                            requested the Secretary’s views.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he wished to make several general observations
                            and that <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> would
                            make some detailed comments. It is the present policy of the United
                            States to withdraw its armed forces gradually from Japan as Japan’s
                            forces increase. The United States has no desire to keep its forces,
                            particularly ground forces, in Japan if they are not needed and if Japan
                            can replace them. As United States forces are reduced, the United States
                            will consider the feasibility of a comparable reduction of Japan’s
                            contribution for their maintenance.</p>
                        <p>Regarding replacement of the present Security Treaty by another treaty,
                            the Secretary thought it was premature to consider this at the moment,
                            since it is not yet clear to the United States that a new treaty would
                            be accepted and carried out by Japan with the solid backing and support
                            which would be required. The Secretary said that he had been both
                            impressed and depressed by the Foreign Minister’s presentation on August
                            29, which pointed up the difficulties faced by the Japanese Government
                            in meeting the Communist threat. As the Foreign Minister had said, the
                            Japanese Government was finding it extremely difficult to deal with the
                            Communists under the Constitution and laws passed during the Occupation.
                            The Secretary referred to the Foreign Minister’s statement that
                            socialists and other leftists had been able to defeat certain bills
                            desired by the Government and to attack the Government’s policy at every
                            turn. The Secretary said that this made him wonder whether a new treaty
                            arrangement would have the effective <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98"
                                facs="0126"/>support it would require. The important thing for a
                            mutual security treaty is a solid basis for cooperation. The Secretary
                            was not confident that the Japanese Government had the unity, cohesion
                            and capacity to operate under a new treaty arrangement. The United
                            States would not like to move from something that now exists to
                            something speculative. The Japanese Diet had ratified the peace and
                            security treaties by large margins and these treaties therefore had a
                            solid juridical and constitutional basis. A new treaty might possibly be
                            ratified, but support for it might not be sufficiently wholehearted to
                            be helpful to Japan-United States relations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the question is not one of fundamental policy so
                            much as of timing. The United States wants a Japan which is able and
                            willing to do what is stated in the preamble of the Security Treaty,
                            namely, to assume increasing responsibility for its defense. As the
                            Foreign Minister said, Japan has not yet reached this position. The
                            Secretary said that Japan had already made great progress in this
                            direction and he did not want to minimize Japan’s efforts to overcome
                            various political and economic difficulties. The United States has
                            always hoped that the Security Treaty can be translated into a different
                            form of treaty when Japan has developed the capacity to defend itself.
                            The time for this has not yet come. Japan’s political situation is very
                            confused, and unfriendly elements in the Diet can block the Government’s
                            efforts to build up its defense system.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that the Foreign Minister might argue that a
                            change in the treaty could alter Japan’s attitude. The Secretary said he
                            doubted this. Opposition in Japan is not to the form of the treaty but
                            to the fact of partnership with the United States. Pro-Communists and
                            neutralist elements would attack a revised treaty. At the moment,
                            therefore, the Secretary questioned whether the time is ripe for
                            negotiations to substitute a new treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the main danger to Japan is indirect
                            aggression. Japan must cope with Communist propaganda and with Communist
                            influences, which will increase under the present treaty system. Japan
                            wants weapons to combat the Communists and this is what the Foreign
                            Minister wants to get by revising the Security Treaty. Japan must have a
                            new treaty system to replace the old one, which is inadequate to cope
                            with internal difficulties posed by the leftists. The Foreign Minister
                            said that he realized a change could not be made overnight and proposed
                            that the fundamental problems be studied and a constructive solution
                            devised.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized his view that a new type of treaty should
                            develop from the conditions contemplated by the present treaty, namely
                            when Japan makes an adequate contribution to its own defense, when a
                            healthy spirit of partnership with the United States has been created,
                            and when anti-Communist elements are strong <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99"
                                facs="0127"/>enough to ensure passage of their programs and an
                            attitude of cooperation with the United States. The Secretary reiterated
                            that Communists everywhere attack security treaties entered into by free
                            nations with the United States, charging vassalage and subordination. A
                            change of treaties in Japan will not eliminate such Communist
                            attacks.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister agreed but said that the attitude of the Japanese
                            people as a whole must be considered. To educate the people of Japan may
                            seem easy but is in fact very difficult. The danger exists that
                            Communist influence in Japan will increase gradually and may become so
                            great that the Government will not be able to cope with it. The
                            situation in Japan differs from that in Formosa and the Philippines,
                            since the Japanese people do not believe that they are being treated as
                            equals under the present arrangements. The Secretary replied that
                            Communists everywhere were trying to force the United States and its
                            partners in the free world to break up and become isolated. The
                            Secretary noted that the United States has a base agreement with the
                            Philippines. The Foreign Minister replied that Japan would like to be in
                            the same position, adding that Japan had to rely on the United States
                            when the Security Treaty was concluded because it had no defense force
                            but that now it does have a defense force. The Secretary commented that
                            Japan’s present force is inadequate. The Foreign Minister replied that
                            Japan will build up its force. The Secretary said that it would be a
                            different matter to talk about changing the treaty at such time as
                            Japan’s defense force is adequate.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that it is premature to talk of changing the
                            present treaty at this time but that it is not premature to consider
                            what conditions would be necessary for concluding a new treaty. He
                            agreed that both governments should cooperate so that Japan could build
                            up its forces and that United States forces should be reduced as Japan
                            was able to assume increased defense responsibilities. The Foreign
                            Minister said that he thought it would take at least three years for
                            Japan to complete its defense program but that the time had now come to
                            study improvements in the present treaty system.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the drafting of a new treaty would be a
                            relatively simple matter. The real problem, however, is to assist Japan
                            in its development of defense capacity and for this much preparatory
                            work is needed. The Secretary suggested that <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> comment on the
                            Japanese defense plan.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Adequacy of Japan’s Forces.</hi><persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff believe that the Japanese defense plan is not adequate
                            for the defense of Japan and that the military threat to Japan cannot be
                            countered by the forces planned. Japan would need assistance to counter
                            this threat and presumably United States assistance would be expected.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that he
                            assumed the Japanese referred to combat forces when they talked about
                            withdrawal of United States <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0128"
                            />ground forces. He pointed out that almost one-half of the United
                            States ground forces in Japan of about 70,000 are support forces with
                            logistic functions. He said that the Japanese plan did not appear
                            adequately to take into account these logistic functions and that
                            Japanese military planners were evidently being restricted in their
                            efforts to plan for the manning of logistic functions even though they
                            appreciated the problems. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> also commented that the air and naval forces
                            planned by Japan were not rounded out. He said that Japan should enlarge
                            its force plan in order to count on withdrawal of United States forces.
                            He agreed that Japan is developing forces larger than some countries in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Manila Pact but said
                            that Japan’s economic and industrial capability is greater than those
                            countries. The United States is planning to reduce the number of its
                            combat ground forces in Japan as Japan develops its forces; because of
                            our own necessities, this reduction may even be faster than Japan’s
                            build-up of ground forces.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister asked about the manner in which Japan should develop
                            support forces. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            replied that consultation in Tokyo would be the best way to work this
                            out and that military men in Tokyo were already consulting on a partial
                            basis. The Foreign Minister asked whether the United States was
                            satisfied with this, and <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> said he thought the consultation could be
                            improved. The Foreign Minister said Japan would make it better and the
                            two countries in close collaboration could move ahead on defense
                            problems in the future. He added that treaty questions should of course
                            be kept under consideration.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Joint Consultation.</hi> The Secretary said that it
                            might be helpful if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName>,
                            the Deputy Secretary of Defense, could talk about consultation between
                            the two governments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName>
                            said that the suggestion had been made that a United States–Japan Joint
                            Committee on Defense might be set up. The United States would be
                            agreeable to this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName>
                            said that the United States might be represented by the Ambassador and
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> who would be assisted by
                            experts as necessary. He commented that such a committee should not, of
                            course, conflict with existing arrangements under the Administrative
                            Agreement but that this committee could have fruitful discussions on
                            joint defense problems of a military nature.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he thought such a committee should not be
                            at a government level but should merely make recommendations to the two
                            governments. In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s question the Foreign Minister said that
                            Japan would probably be represented by experts from the Defense Agency.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> agreed that this
                            should be an advisory committee. The Foreign Minister suggested that the
                            committee might also consider a future treaty organization. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> replied that the
                            committee’s primary work should be <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101"
                                facs="0129"/>devoted to defense problems but that the committee
                            could have the effect of expediting Japan’s development of defense
                            strength so that time for consideration of a new treaty would be
                            accelerated. The Foreign Minister commented that perhaps the American
                            Ambassador in Tokyo and the Foreign Office could consider various treaty
                            problems.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Runway Extensions.</hi> The Secretary suggested that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName>, the Assistant
                            Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, might discuss
                            certain special problems. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>
                            said that the Defense Department is concerned about runway extensions in
                            Japan. Agreements on this have been made with the Japanese Government
                            and the Defense Department is encouraged to hear that the Japanese
                            Government is now planning special measures to carry out this program.
                            On the other hand the scope and organization of demonstrations in
                            opposition to this program have been discouraging. It is important that
                            the Japanese people understand that this program is in their own
                            interest, particularly since Japanese aircraft will eventually need the
                            extended space for their operations. Countermeasures against the current
                            demonstrations are desirable and the United States is willing to
                            assist.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister agreed that we should take measures to keep the
                            Communists down but said that use of force in this situation could be
                            dangerous. He emphasized that the Occupation had abolished all laws for
                            effectively dealing with Communists and that it is now almost impossible
                            to handle them. The only power available to the Japanese Government at
                            present is that of persuasion, and the Government must develop solid
                            anti-Communist strength in order to muster its power of persuasion. The
                            Foreign Minister stated that he is ready to accept a Joint Defense
                            Committee but emphasized that Japan and the United States must go
                            farther and talk about their fundamental treaty position in order to
                            make clear that Japan is not on an unequal basis. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> commented that such a
                            committee would be further evidence of cooperation between the two
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> observed that Mr.

                            extension was that the people of Japan should be convinced of the need
                            for this program in the interest of their own defense. The Foreign
                            Minister responded that the Japanese people do not listen to the
                            Government, which has promised to extend the runways and may even be
                            forced to confiscate the necessary land. This, however, might play into
                            the hands of the leftists. The Foreign Minister added that the
                            opposition to runway extensions is not genuine and is
                            Communist-inspired.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Constitutional Interpretation.</hi> The Secretary then
                            inquired whether Japan could send forces outside of Japan to help the
                            United States if it were attacked, adding that this appeared doubtful
                            and that the Japanese <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0130"
                            />Government would have to be stronger before a basis of mutuality
                            existed. The Secretary commented that the situation would be different
                            when Japan had adequate forces, a sufficient legal framework and an
                            amended constitution. He asked specifically whether Japan could go to
                            the defense of the United States if Guam were attacked. The Foreign
                            Minister replied that Japan could do so and that under its present
                            system Japan can organize forces for self-defense. The Secretary said
                            that this would not be a case of the self-defense of Japan but rather of
                            defense of the United States. The Foreign Minister replied that in such
                            a situation Japan would first consult with the United States and would
                            then decide whether or not to use its forces. The Secretary said that he
                            was not clear as to the Foreign Minister’s interpretation of the
                            Japanese Constitution and added that he had thought the broadest
                            commitment Japan could make would be to use its forces for the defense
                            of Japan. The Foreign Minister replied that Japan’s forces must be used
                            for self-defense and that Japan could consult, in the case of an attack
                            in connection with a treaty, regarding the use of its forces.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that consultation would not mean very much if the
                            constitution prevented the sending of forces abroad. The Foreign
                            Minister answered that Japan’s interpretation included the use of forces
                            for self-defense and consultation as to whether or not forces should be
                            sent abroad. He commented that Japan would like to have a treaty like
                            the United States-Phillippine treaty and that this is possible even
                            under the present constitution. The Secretary said that he had not
                            previously realized that Japan thought it could do this.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister emphasized that Japan wanted to be an equal partner
                            like other countries having mutual security treaties with the United
                            States and said that Japan is determined to move ahead with its defense.
                            The Secretary said that he thought appropriate language could be worked
                            out in the joint communiqué to cover the ideas of both sides.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he wanted to be sure that the United
                            States did not intend to keep Japan in a semi-independent position. The
                            Secretary said that this was not the case, that Japan had made a treaty
                            which had been overwhelmingly approved by the Diet and that this did not
                            mean a semi-independent position. He emphasized that every treaty
                            involves a partial surrender of sovereignty and that interdependence and
                            cooperation rather than independence are the requirements. For Japan to
                            consider itself as unequal is wrong; this is not the way the United
                            States treats Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that every year Japan must negotiate with the
                            United States regarding its budget. The Secretary replied that we should
                            get away from the unnecessary difficulties of these negotiations. He
                            then pointed out that every year the United States and the <pb n="103"
                                xml:id="pg_103" facs="0131"/><gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries have a budget review in December and that this process is part
                            and parcel of the collective security system. Of course we should arrive
                            at a system by which the yearly budget debates with Japan might be less
                            acriminous and we should try to reach some automatic formula. Changing
                            the treaty, however, would not accomplish this. Wherever there is a
                            joint or composite effort, there must be joint discussion of the
                            respective contributions. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> commented that this problem appeared to have been
                            covered earlier when the Secretary suggested that as Japan’s forces went
                            up, its contributions would go down. The Foreign Minister said that
                            Japan desired to know the size of the American forces in Japan and plans
                            for their reduction, adding that there had been conflicting reports on
                            this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> commented that a joint
                            committee in Tokyo could go into this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that he was elated
                            to know that the United States would discuss the question of treaty
                            revision when the time is ripe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> stressed that it is essential to improve the
                            economic livelihood of the people of Japan and to eliminate unsettled
                            conditions which produce communism. It is essential to consolidate the
                            conservative forces in Japan and to devise economic plans to combat
                            communism and to strengthen Japan’s defense program. This will
                            facilitate withdrawal of the United States forces and revision of
                            Japan’s constitution. The joint committee should discuss measures for
                            the defense of Japan at minimum cost. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> said that as a member of the Democratic Party he
                            wished to make these observations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> then said that he
                            would like to recapitulate the discussion in order to make sure that his
                            understanding was correct. Although the Secretary had said that the time
                            was not ripe for the immediate conclusion of a new defense treaty, the
                            Foreign Minister understood that the Secretary was in agreement so far
                            as its principle was concerned. On the other hand the internal situation
                            in Japan makes it imperative to establish a system of defense based on a
                            new defense treaty with the United States on the basis of mutuality. The
                            Foreign Minister, therefore, proposed to begin forthwith work to prepare
                            for a new mutual defense treaty to replace the existing security treaty
                            as soon as Japan’s defense forces have reached the size deemed adequate
                            for national defense. Such work might be continued through normal
                            diplomatic channels. The Secretary said that he would like to study this
                            recapitulation of the discussion further.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that no nation is as eager to see Japan resume
                            its rightful place as is the United States. A weak Japan is the contrary
                            of everything the United States wants and has been working for. The
                            United States would not have taken so many measures to assist the
                            recovery of Japan if it had not wanted to see a strong vigorous Japan
                            resume its rightful place in Asia. The Secretary said <pb n="104"
                                xml:id="pg_104" facs="0132"/>that he was concerned to hear that the
                            only way Japan could assert itself is by turning against the United
                            States, which is trying in every way to help Japan. The Secretary said
                            he did not think this was a wise course. He expressed the hope that the
                            situation in Japan would change and that conditions necessary for
                            mutuality would develop. He added that the United States should not be
                            required to provide security for the Philippines and for Formosa. Japan
                            should be doing this, and the United States could withdraw its
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he had no illusions regarding these
                            matters and that he was grateful to have the Secretary’s views. The
                            Secretary commented that we would both be better off with a strong,
                            vigorous Japan. The Foreign Minister reiterated that Japan wants to
                            fight Communist influence and that that is the reason Japan is making
                            its proposal regarding the treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and the Foreign Minister briefly discussed and agreed on
                            the text of a press statement regarding the meeting.</p>

                                corresp="#p_MTF1">Matsumoto</persName> called on Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> at their request at 10 a.m. on
                            August 31. The meeting lasted just over one hour; Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, who had another appointment and
                            had to leave early, did most of the talking for the first part of the
                            meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> entered into the
                            discussion only after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            departure.</p>
                        <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0133"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> opened the discussion by
                            outlining the purpose of the visit: to discuss fully and frankly the
                            future of US–Japan relations. The official meetings with the Secretary
                            on August 29 and 30 had been extremely useful. However, he and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> hoped that they could now
                            take off their coats and speak with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1"
                                >Sebald</persName> somewhat more frankly on an unofficial basis.
                            They wished to know US views regarding Japan, our opinions and hopes for
                            Japan’s future. But at the same time they wished to make clear to us
                            Japan’s own views and hopes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> said that he was
                            delighted at the opportunity to speak with Japanese leaders on an
                            unofficial basis. It was of course necessary for us to confer with the
                            official representative of Japan, but he was sure such unofficial
                            meetings as the present one could be most valuable in improving our
                            mutual understanding. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>
                            said that, while he had nothing particular to say at the moment
                            regarding US “requests” of Japan, he did wish to ask some questions
                            regarding Japan’s internal political situation. Actually Japan’s
                            complicated internal political situation created a serious problem for
                            the US in connection with the present Washington meetings. For instance,
                            even if it were possible to reach a complete meeting of minds on various
                            issues in US–Japan relations, we frankly did not know how long the
                            present government would last, or whether it represented the Japanese
                            people. We simply could not foresee the Japanese political future.
                            However, he did have the impression that the Japanese conservatives,
                            instead of closing their ranks and forming a strong government, were
                            divided into factions and were fighting among themselves. Unless the
                            conservatives could get together he feared that the Socialists would
                            come to power. If this happened Japan would rapidly go down hill.
                            Moreover, as the Secretary had said in an earlier meeting, it would be
                            impossible to carry out essential projects, e.g., establishment of a
                            strong military force and enactment of adequate security measures,
                            unless there is strong leadership in Japan, with power in the hands of a
                            strong government supported by a working Diet majority.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Japan’s internal situation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> said that he personally disagreed with the Foreign
                            Minister as to the extent of the Communist threat. He felt that in
                            discussions with the Secretary yesterday the Foreign Minister had
                            greatly exaggerated the danger. The threat could certainly not be
                            ignored, but it was not as serious as the Foreign Mininster had depicted
                            it. The basic problem in combatting communism in Japan was to create a
                            strong union of the conservative forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName>, Bukichi Miki <note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">An
                                adviser to Prime Minister Hatoyama.</note> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> himself, were working hard to
                            achieve a conservative union. He could make no definite promise as to
                            when the goal might be achieved; however, Japanese public opinion was
                            strongly in favor of a union of the conservative forces, and with <pb
                                n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0134"/>public support he was confident
                            that they would be successful. In this connection Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> took pains to point out that he
                            had accompanied the Foreign Minister to Washington at Prime Minister
                            Hatoyama’s specific request. Mr. Hatoyama had wished him to make clear
                            that the viewpoints being expressed were those of all conservatives, not
                            merely the Foreign Minister alone, and that they would be essentially
                            the same no matter who was Prime Minister of Japan. In an earlier
                            meeting the Secretary had mentioned that many missions appeared to have
                            been sent to Washington to strengthen the hand of one political leader
                            or group against rival forces at home. This certainly was not true of
                            the present mission. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>
                            said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s comments
                            were most reassuring.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that he would like
                            to express his own views as to Japan’s basic problems which were perhaps
                            somewhat different from those of the Foreign Minister. He believed that
                            Japan’s number one problem was the stabilization of her economy; without
                            economic stability as a basis there was little point in talking of
                            fighting communism, conservative unification or a possible new alliance
                            with the US. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> felt that
                            the purpose of the present meeting should not be to ask for a new treaty
                            or to discuss other abstract matters, but to exchange views frankly and
                            concretely as to what the US and Japan could do to their mutual
                            advantage, principally in the economic sphere, concerning which Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> as former Minister of
                            Commerce and Industry felt he could speak with some authority. In the
                            official meeting today the Japanese delegation intended to take up the
                            matter of economic planning for Japan, specifically the six-year
                            economic plan which the Government had prepared. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> emphasized that he was thinking
                            not in terms of a controlled economy on the socialist pattern, but
                            rather a planned economy, and he hoped the blueprint to be presented
                            would help clarify Japan’s economic situation and prospects. Though
                            there had been a marked improvement in the Japanese economy in the 10
                            years since the war, basic problems remain to be solved—for example, the
                            tremendous population pressure, the possibility of expanding Japan’s
                            markets in Southeast Asia, possible increase of trade with Communist
                            China. It would not be possible for Japan to achieve the goals of the
                            six-year economic plan without the understanding and active cooperation
                            of the United States, and without United States investments and
                            technical assistance. As an example, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> cited the problem created by the expansion of
                            Japan’s productive facilities to meet United States requirements in the
                            Korean war. These industries now lacked orders and were facing serious
                            financial difficulties. However, Japan wished to retain these industrial
                            facilities for her own use, possibly under government ownership and
                            management. The United States could assist Japan in maintaining these
                            facilities through <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> orders to provide
                            military equipment for countries of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0135"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> observed that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s proposal regarding
                                <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> orders was well worth exploring,
                            though there were many technical problems involved. He went on to say
                            that one of the cardinal points of United States policy toward Japan was
                            to assist Japan in every possible way to achieve a viable economy. The
                            United States had made great efforts to bring about Japan’s accession to
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and had assisted in a great
                            many other ways. One of the difficulties, of course, was that these
                            problems were not solely economic but had political implications as
                            well.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that before leaving
                            he wished to summarize his views as to the three major sources of
                            friction between Japan and the United States and the means of
                            eliminating them. The first of these was that arising from the existence
                            of numerous United States bases and the presence of large numbers of
                            American troops in Japan. The way to solve this problem, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> believed, was for Japan to
                            increase her own military strength as rapidly as possible in order to
                            bring about the withdrawal of United States ground forces in Japan. The
                            second problem centered around the annual haggling over Japan’s defense
                            budget and Japan’s contribution to the support of United States forces
                            in Japan. These negotiations created the unfortunate impression that
                            Japan could not form her own budget without United States consent. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> believed that the
                            general principles outlined by the Secretary in yesterday’s session
                            offered an excellent means of overcoming this problem. The third major
                            irritant was the fact that numbers of Japanese war criminals were still
                            held in detention ten years after the end of the war. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> hoped that the United States would
                            take a “bold stand” and settle this problem once and for all. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> remarked that he and the
                            Foreign Minister had spent some time in Sugamo Prison and could not but
                            be emotionally concerned in obtaining the release of those still in
                            prison as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Following Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s departure Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTF1">Matsumoto</persName> said that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and himself did not wish to create
                            the impression that they were putting their nose into other people’s
                            affairs. Actually they were cooperating fully and wholeheartedly with
                            the Foreign Minister in his mission. It was true they had not received
                            full cooperation from Ambassador Kase and some other members of the
                            Foreign Minister’s party. For example, papers prepared for the
                            discussions had not been made available to them until some time after
                            the discussions had been completed. However, he could assure us that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and himself had every intention of
                            cooperating fully with the Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>, who had occasionally
                            nodded in agreement but otherwise had not participated in the
                            discussions while Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> was
                            present, now began to express his own views. He said first of all that
                            he intended to be even more frank than Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> had been. He had long <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108"
                                facs="0136"/>been handicapped in seeking to understand the United
                            States and United States views because of his inability to speak English
                            and until coming to Washington had not had any clear ideas as to United
                            States thinking. This ignorance regarding United States policies and
                            intentions was a great handicap to a Japanese political leader. If he
                            really knew what the United States’ precise ideas and objectives really
                            were, his task as a Japanese political leader was much easier. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that as a result of
                            his visit to the United States he had learned a great deal about United
                            States objectives and views regarding Japan and would be in a position
                            to work for our mutual goals more effectively than in the past. In this
                            connection he remarked that if Mr. Hatoyama and Mr. Ogata (who were
                            actually on much closer terms than we might imagine) were well informed
                            regarding United States thinking, they would no longer be groping in the
                            dark and their task would be much easier.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that he believed the
                            Foreign Minister in his talk with the Secretary had overdone the danger
                            of the Communist threat in Japan. The Foreign Minister had perhaps done
                            so because he misunderstood the United States views on the Communist
                            threat and how to combat it. If Japanese leaders knew precisely what
                            United States views were regarding the internal and external Communist
                            threat to Japan, their task would be much easier. The same was true of
                            Japan’s defense program: if Japanese leaders had United States views
                            thoroughly in mind they would not have to operate by trial and error.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> thought much of the
                            difficulty arose from the fact that diplomats and petty officials were
                            in the habit of bargaining over minor issues and missed the significant
                            points which in any event were not accurately conveyed to Japan’s real
                            leaders. Once clear and mutual understanding had been reached on
                            objectives, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> and his
                            colleagues would know what tactical course to follow in order to achieve
                            them in Japan—e.g., shaping public opinion, etc.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the domestic political situation in Japan, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that in last February’s
                            elections the conservatives had been working under severe handicaps: the
                            Liberals had been badly hurt by the scandals, and the newly formed
                            Democratic Party had not had sufficient time to prepare for the
                            campaign. If there was time to prepare, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> was confident that when elections are held again
                            the conservatives could easily win a two-thirds Diet majority, then
                            amend the constitution and carry out other essential neasures. Here
                            again, though, a great source of difficulty was the fact that Japan’s
                            political leaders did not clearly understand the United States views
                            regarding Japan’s political situation (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> said that Bukichi Miki shared his concern in this
                            regard). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> remarked that
                            yesterday’s “argument” between the Secretary and the Foreign Minister
                            was the result of such misunderstanding. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> himself actually had found that <pb n="109"
                                xml:id="pg_109" facs="0137"/>the Secretary’s presentation was much
                            more logical and reasonable than that of the Foreign Minister. In this
                            connection he was confident that the formula proposed by the Secretary
                            would be agreeable to Prime Minister Hatoyama.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> at this point referred
                            briefly to the joint consultative committee which had been proposed at
                            yesterday’s meeting and said that the United States thought of the
                            committee as a high level group which would thrash out various problems
                            arising between our two countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> said there had been at first some misunderstanding
                            on his part as to the nature of the joint committee. He had originally
                            understood that the committee, which he himself had first proposed, was
                            to be at the technical level. Then he had heard that it was to be at the
                            highest level, which would create the impression in Japan that the
                            United States was interfering in Japan’s internal affairs. Now it
                            appeared that the committee was to be at a somewhat lower level.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> pointed out that many
                            problems which arose were not wholly military or political in character.
                            For this reason it had been proposed that both the Ambassador and <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> be on the committee. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> said that of course
                            it was not our intention that the committee would make policy decisions;
                            rather the United States representatives would discuss problems with
                            such representatives from Defense, Finance, and the Foreign Ministry as
                            the Japanese Government might designate. The committee would make
                            recommendations, but final decisions would of course be left to the two
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that he did not
                            believe the committee should be at too high a level or that it should
                            include cabinet ministers. Perhaps representation at the vice-minister
                            level would be satisfactory. If really important problems arose,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> could talk to
                            him directly, and he could see that satisfactory cabinet action was
                            taken. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> agreed
                            that representation at the cabinet level perhaps was not necessary; he
                            did believe however that Japanese representatives should be at a
                            sufficiently high level to reflect accurately the Japanese Government’s
                            views.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that he had been at a
                            loss to understand why the Foreign Minister had been so interested in
                            establishing the consultative committee, and at first had thought that
                            the Foreign Minister was using the proposal as a bargaining weapon to
                            bring about the revison of the Security Treaty. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said he agreed that the time was
                            not yet ripe for the revision of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> emphasized
                            that when problems of major importance arose it would be well to take
                            them up directly with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>,
                            Bukichi Miki, or himself. They were the three men who presently control
                            the Japanese Government and they all had Prime Minister Hatoyama’s full
                            confidence. If necessary one of the three could be <pb n="110"
                                xml:id="pg_110" facs="0138"/>sent back to Washington or Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> could approach them
                            in Tokyo. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>
                            suggested that after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> and
                            his colleagues had returned to Tokyo and after they had reviewed the
                            situation it might be well to get together with him for further
                            discussions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> appeared to
                            agree. As a final example of the importance of frank, direct discussion
                            at the highest level, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>
                            said the difficulties arising over Japan’s purchase of surplus
                            agricultural products could have been easily avoided if the matter had
                            been taken up with him directly rather than with lesser officials. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> agreed that the
                            important thing was to understand each other fully and to recognize each
                            other’s problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> indicated he would like to
                            have further talks with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1"
                                >Sebald</persName>. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTF1"
                                >Matsumoto</persName> would probably be leaving and there was no
                            other interpreter whom he could fully trust.</p>
                        <p>In a brief conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LRH1"
                                >Lamb</persName> immediately following the meeting with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTF1">Matsumoto</persName> said that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, and himself had been greatly disturbed at the
                            Foreign Minister’s presentation in his discussion with the Secretary on
                            August 30. The Foreign Minister’s approach, his exaggeration of the
                            Communist threat, had been all wrong; it had certainly not been worthy
                            of a professional diplomat. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTF1"
                                >Matsumoto</persName> and his colleagues were at a loss to know why
                            the Foreign Minister had taken this approach, concerning which they had
                            no knowledge. At first Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTF1"
                                >Matsumoto</persName> had suspected that the Foreign Minister had
                            some special motive. He was now inclined to believe however that the
                            Foreign Minister had simply been “boxed in” and said things he had not
                            intended to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTF1">Matsumoto</persName> also said that Prime
                            Minister Hatoyama had instructed him to see that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> were brought fully into discussions with United
                            States leaders, and that they were given an opportunity to gain a
                            thorough understanding of United States views and overall thinking
                            regarding Japan. <note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">In telegram 467 to Tokyo,

                        <p>The Secretary invited the Foreign Minister to continue his
                            presentation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said he had a number
                            of observations on economic subjects. He presented and read a paper
                            (attached) <note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">Not printed. It asked that the
                                United States not impose any new tariff or quantitative restrictions
                                on Japanese goods, that Japanese capital goods be purchased in the

                            and read a paper (attached) <note n="3" xml:id="d47fn3">Not
                                printed.</note> entitled “Resumption of Japanese Enterprises in the
                            South Sea Islands Formerly Under Japanese Mandate”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he would comment briefly on
                            these two papers and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                                >Hollister</persName> would comment at length if he desired. He
                            appreciated the difficult economic position of Japan with its growing
                            population and its small natural resources. As he had said at dinner
                            with the Foreign Minister, Japan had to make its living from its human
                            resources rather than its natural resources. The United States has not
                            only recognized this problem but has tried to do something about it,
                            which is more than some can say. The United States has tried to avoid
                            the imposition of restrictions upon Japan’s exports to the United States
                            and is glad to recognize that the Japanese Government has exerted its
                            influence on Japanese industrialists and exporters to avoid flooding the
                            American market. Speaking to representatives of another country, the
                            Secretary had recently had occasion to point out that if they had been
                            content with a reasonable share of the American market the restrictive
                            measures on the United States side would not have happened. No country
                            can be expected to allow a complete monopoly of the market by a foreign
                            country in a given line. The foreign country must be content with a
                            reasonable access to the American market, and he was glad to note that
                            Japan appeared to recognize this fact. The anti-trust laws had also to
                            be considered but voluntary self-restraint is not illegal and can be
                            very helpful.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary welcomed Japan’s admission as a full member of the General
                            Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States had taken the lead in
                            the recent tariff negotiations leading to Japan’s full accession, <note

                                ff.</note> he said, and hoped that the efforts which this country is
                            prepared to make to develop capital improvements in Asia can be
                            conducted in a way which will afford opportunity for Japan, as the only
                            industrialized country in the area. United States expenditures for
                            economic development in Asia can thus accomplish several purposes if
                            they are handled in the right way. The arrangements with respect to sale
                            of agricultural commodities have to some extent been handled in this
                            way. The United States has Japan’s economic position very much in mind
                            in examining the problems of economic development in Asia. The gap in
                            Japan’s direct trade with the U.S. is considerable and has been met by
                            U.S. military expenditures in Japan. Offshore procurement connected with
                            the hostilities in Korea has naturally declined with the termination of
                            hostilities. The U.S. of course does not want to see resumption of the
                            war, and that particular kind of expenditure therefore cannot be
                            expected to recur. The Secretary recognized that <pb n="113"
                                xml:id="pg_113" facs="0141"/>Japan has taken austerity measures to
                            limit its consumption and improve its foreign trade—belatedly, to be
                            sure, but the measures have been taken. He recalled that when he was in
                            Tokyo some years ago Japan was a luxury market in which almost anything
                            could be bought. Now Japan has taken certain austerity measures to
                            control luxury imports and this has helped to balance its foreign trade
                            position. The Secretary suggested that there will always be an imbalance
                            in Japan’s direct trade with the U.S. which would be made up by
                            invisible earnings and earnings from three-cornered transactions. This
                            is also the case with the U.K. and is not abnormal.</p>
                        <p>With respect to trade with Communist China the Secretary said he had the
                            feeling that this was more of a psychological than an economic factor.
                            Japan never had a big trade with China proper, independent of its
                            domination there. Korea and Manchuria were big markets after Japan’s
                            political influence was established there, but in the main China is a
                            poor area and does not have much to export. The general experience of
                            countries that have tried to trade with China is that they get nothing
                            worthwhile except in return for highly strategic goods for which the
                            Communists are willing to make a sacrifice in exchange. The Secretary
                            doubted that a change in the control list would have great economic
                            results. You may say, he added, that if that is so, shouldn’t we modify
                            the list to conform to the European list. The other side of the picture
                            is that it is not easy to make a change unless it is occasioned by some
                            act on the part of the Chinese which seems to call for some recognition
                            on the part of the free nations. The Ambassadorial talks going on in
                            Geneva have so far been unproductive. And at present the United States
                            considers that there should be no relaxation of trade controls. He
                            appreciated that the problem in Japan is partly political rather than
                            economic but believed that Japan should cooperate with the United States
                            because Japan also has a stake. Sooner or later some revision of the
                            export list is inevitable but the time has not yet come.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> said that there was
                            little that he could add to the Secretary’s remarks. It was only a few
                            weeks since the Congress had approved the legislation establishing the
                            Presidential fund for regional economic development. The Congress had
                            reduced the amount of the fund by one-half and had approved it as a
                            three-year program. The authorities concerned will have to study
                            carefully the proposals for use of the fund. Such studies are now going
                            forward with particular reference to the regional aspect. He would be
                            interested to have any Japanese suggestions with respect to the
                            utilization of the fund.</p>
                        <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0142"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the resumption of Japanese enterprises in the
                            South Sea Islands posed problems relating primarily to security. The
                            Department of Defense has strong views on this subject. The Department
                            of State would take it up again with the Department of Defense and see
                            if there has been any change in their views.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said that if there
                            was any information which could be conveyed about U.S. thinking on
                            economic cooperation in South and Southeast Asia, Japan would always
                            appreciate receiving it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked the Foreign Minister whether Japan is now selling
                            more in Southeast Asia. He recalled that when the French were in
                            authority in Indochina the U.S. gave considerable financial assistance
                            to France which was reflected in the availability of francs locally in
                            Indochina. Now United States assistance goes to this area directly and
                            the Secretary wondered if this did not lead to some increase in Japan’s
                            trade with Indochina.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said that trade with
                            the area had increased and that on the whole the U.S. economic
                            assistance to Southeast Asia had helped Japan’s exports considerably.
                            Mr. Yukawa said that in 1954 Japan had exported $480 million worth of
                            goods to the area representing 32% of its exports and had imported $380
                            million worth representing 20% of its total imports.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>
                            suggested that the figures for 1955 should reflect an increase.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said that they hoped
                            for such an increase. As for China trade, he asked if the U.S. thought
                            it was too early to consider a change. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            said yes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if any of the approximately 290 items referred to in
                            the Japanese paper which are exportable to the European-Soviet Bloc but
                            embargoed to Communist China were of particular importance to Japan. Mr.
                            Yukawa referred to galvanized iron sheets. The Secretary suggested that
                            Japan’s experts might discuss particular items with U.S. experts and let
                            the U.S. Government know which ones if any were of particular
                            importance. The Foreign Minister said that this would be done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> then presented and
                            read a paper on war criminals (attached). <note n="5" xml:id="d47fn5"
                                >Not printed. It contained a request that the United States release
                                all Japanese under its jurisdiction who were still in
                                confinement.</note></p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the announcement being made that day with
                            respect to the parole of an additional 22 persons under U.S.
                            jurisdiction. <note n="6" xml:id="d47fn6">The announcement contained the
                                names of all those paroled. For text, see Department of State <hi

                            He handed the Foreign Minister a copy of the list of persons to be
                            paroled. He suggested that this was at least a step in the direction
                            desired by Japan.</p>
                        <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0143"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> expressed thanks but
                            said that he hoped for further steps.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it was a very difficult situation because the
                            persons who are still in custody have committed what the Japanese would
                            recognize as grievous crimes. The Japanese might say that crimes were
                            committed during the war on both sides. This may be true to some extent
                            but the actual records in this case give rise to some very real concern.
                            The U.S. is trying to work this problem out as best it can. Granting
                            that it may tend to create anti-American feeling for the U.S. to
                            continue to detain these persons, it is also important to bear in mind
                            that if there were a spectacular blanket release there would be protests
                            by various organizations and individuals in this country and this would
                            tend to revive anti-Japanese feeling here. The way out of this dilemma
                            is not easy to find but it has been solved so far without stimulating
                            anti-Japanese sentiment. The U.S. Government is trying to continue to
                            handle it in a way to accomplish Japanese desires without incurring
                            liabilities here which are not in the U.S. or Japanese interest.
                            Therefore, it is not possible to promise a general parole but the U.S.
                            Government is working in this direction with due regard to what its own
                            people consider to be just and to averting a public outcry which could
                            revive feelings in the U.S. which have been beneath the surface—but not
                            far beneath. The whole problem has been given careful thought, has been
                            considered personally by both the President and the Secretary and has
                            been reconsidered from time to time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added that with respect to the seven persons convicted by
                            the International Tribunal, there is now agreement among the countries
                            concerned that the sentences can be reduced within the near future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> expressed
                            appreciation for U.S. consideration of this subject. He then presented
                            and read a paper on the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands (attached). <note n="7"
                                xml:id="d47fn7">Not printed. It contained arguments for the
                                restoration of both groups of islands to Japan.</note></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he thought it should be made clear in the
                            interest of mutual understanding that the U.S. is not prepared at this
                            time to give any consideration to a change in the status of the Ryukyu
                            and Bonin Islands. The U.S. drew the line in the Treaty farther south
                            than was originally intended and thereafter returned the Amami Islands
                            to Japanese administration. That is all that the U.S. is prepared to do
                            with respect to a change in the status of the islands. The U.S. is
                            making large defense expenditures in these areas and it does not appear
                            to be in the common interest for their status to be agitated. With
                            respect to Japan’s residual sovereignty the Secretary said that he was
                            prepared as Secretary of State to stand by his statement as Delegate <pb
                                n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0144"/>of the U.S. to the Peace
                            Conference at San Francisco. With respect to the nationality of the
                            inhabitants he did not know that the U.S. had made any statement on this
                            point. It was a complicated subject which it might be possible to
                            clarify but it will have to be studied with our legal experts. He said
                            that this would be done and the Japanese would be further advised. With
                            respect to the return of inhabitants to the Bonins, he was not very
                            familiar with this matter and preferred not to comment. The Defense
                            Department had very much opposed their return and it was his
                            recollection that they had valid security objections. It would be
                            discussed with the Defense Department again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said that of the
                            Bonin Islands, Iwo Jima was the only one that was fortified.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then read the draft of a final joint statement which had
                            been prepared by representatives of the two sides and it was agreed with
                            minor drafting changes.</p>
                        <p>In the course of consideration of the final statement the Secretary
                            commented, on reading the sentence on settlement for economic
                            assistance, that he “was very glad to know that”. <note n="8"
                                xml:id="d47fn8">In the joint statement as released on August 31, the
                                sentence reads: “It was agreed that no major obstacles remain to
                                settlement for economic assistance rendered to Japan during the
                                occupation and that utmost efforts will be made to bring the
                                negotiations in Tokyo on this subject to an early conclusion.” For

                        <p>The Sec. referred to the Japanese visiting him. G, does not know how many
                            and said he would get them at the nearest airport. The Sec. said he
                            thinks that very nice. G. thinks it will be general and noticed what
                            they said today. The Sec. said we have just concluded our talks here and
                            they have been very satisfactory. He thinks they will push ahead with
                            their own military establishments and relieve us of responsibilities
                            there. That is the main thing we talked about. They are interested in
                            trade business. The Sec. said they are being pretty good in taking steps
                            not to flood the American market with Japanese goods. They are trying to
                            do that and the Sec. said G. might usefully emphasize that. G. will and
                            asked if there is anything else the Sec. can suggest. The Sec. said the
                            only other thing to emphasize is that they don’t gain anything by making
                            concessions to the Commies. Also, they want a new form of security
                            treaty. The Sec. said when they are entitled to it, they can get it, but
                            they should not think that with a new form of treaty, the Commies will
                            be stilled. As long as they are working with us, they will be shouting
                            they are an American colony. They needn’t think they can change that
                            situation by changing the treaty. G. agreed. G. said we would have to
                            stand by if trouble came. The Sec. indicated agreement. The Sec. said we
                            have agreed on a communiqué and suggested someone going tomorrow might
                            take it. G. will be glad to have it, as he knew nothing about the fact
                            they were due in.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a brief discussion of the Middle East.]</p>
                        <p>G. said he supposes the Japanese are anxious to extend their trade in
                            some areas where they think they would have profitable trade—SEA. The
                            Sec. said we want to see that happen. The Sec. said he was going on
                            vacation tommorow.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> expressed most
                            warmly his appreciation for his treatment here and felt that the talks
                            had been of inestimable value.</p>
                        <p>He asked whether or not we were giving thought to a possible Far Eastern
                            conference. I said no, that one obstacle was the anti-Japanese attitude
                            of <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Syngman Rhee</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> was very difficult to deal with;
                            that they had tried to be conciliatory but without any result.</p>
                        <p>I said that if ever the Japanese Government felt that a Far Eastern
                            conference would be useful, I hoped that they would feel free to make
                            the suggestion to us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said that if ever
                            anything happened in Japan that we did not like, please to let him know
                            through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said that he thought
                            that sooner or later it would be necessary to recognize the fact of the
                            Communist regime on the mainland, but that he hoped that we would not
                            ever let the Communists get hold of Formosa. He said that that would
                            have a very bad effect on the Philippines and, in that way, upon the
                            whole Western Pacific situation.</p>
                        <p>I reaffirmed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> what
                            I had said the night before at the dinner when speaking with <persName

                                >Kishi</persName> that basic United States policy was to have Japan
                            develop again into a great power; that we wanted the relationship to be
                            one where the United States was backing Japan in the Western Pacific and
                            not a relationship where we were wanting Japan to back us. <note n="2"

                                    present was good, because they represent much political power.
                                    The important thing for us is to get the right-wing parties to
                                    consolidate and not tear each other apart and seek popularity by
                                    joining in the ‘American go home’ theme. I believe our talks
                                    impressed them with the need to consolidate on a platform of
                                    cooperation with the United States. I hope the impression will
                                    survive long enough for it to produce some political results.

                            issuance communiqué. <note n="4" xml:id="d50fn4">The pertinent paragraph
                                of the joint statement reads as follows:<p>“It was agreed that
                                    efforts should be made, whenever practicable on a cooperative
                                    basis, to establish conditions such that Japan could, as rapidly
                                    as possible, assume primary responsibility for the defense of
                                    its homeland and be able to contribute to the preservation of
                                    international peace and security in the Western Pacific. It was
                                    also agreed that when such conditions are brought about it would
                                    be appropriate to replace the present Security Treaty with one
                                    of greater mutuality.”</p></note></p>
                        <p>To question whether reference to contribution to peace security Western
                            Pacific “means during conversations you both had in mind some time in
                            future Japanese troops will be sent outside Japan for preservation

                            Clarified later during briefing as follows:</p>
                        <p>Query: With regard to sending forces abroad did Japanese discuss matter
                            with that in mind? Were they ready and willing do that?</p>
                        <p>Reply: They recognized quite clearly, I think, that this is possibility
                            which would arise if there were change in form of treaty. This clearly
                            not something imminent any more than change in form of treaty imminent
                            but is kind of problem which arises if form of treaty changed so that
                            Japan incurs obligation for mutual or collective defense in area.</p>
                        <p>Query: Was that predicated on change in constitution?</p>
                        <p>Reply: That was one of things talked about as possibly necessary.</p>
                        <p>Query: Is that considered prerequisite by U.S.?</p>
                        <p>Reply: We have no judgment. Question is whether Japanese think it is
                            possible under constitution or whether change required before they
                                can.<note n="5" xml:id="d50fn5">In telegram 491 to Tokyo, September
                                3, the Department stated that it was advising newsmen that no
                                commitments existed between the United States and Japan on the
                                sending of Japanese troops abroad and that the subject had been
                                discussed only in a hypothetical way. If asked, the Department said,
                                it would state that it concurred in a statement made in New York on
                                September 2 by <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> that
                                no such understanding existed. In conclusion, the Department briefly
                                summarized discussion of the issue in the August 30 conversation
                                between <persName>Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SM1"

                        <p>With reference to six year plan and force levels stated our military
                            think larger forces, ground forces in particular, would be necessary in
                            Japan to meet what they conceive strategic requirement to be.</p>
                        <p>Query: Some years ago Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said it was our belief they needed 10 divisions
                            and 350,000 troops. Is that still our thinking that is what strategic
                            requirements are?</p>
                        <p>Reply: Roughly that number men. I wouldn’t use number of divisions
                            because divisions can be handled various ways. I think they tend think
                            more rather than less divisions.</p>
                        <p>Query: In other words, we don’t think it feasible to withdraw our forces
                            from Japan until strategic requirement of 350,000 men achieved?</p>
                        <p>Reply: That does not necessarily follow.</p>
                        <p>Query: Did U.S. argue for 350,000 figure and try to force it on
                            Japanese?</p>
                        <p>Reply: No.</p>
                        <p>Query: That is the American thinking—the military people?</p>
                        <p>Reply: I wasn’t citing that as something which was discussed but as a
                            long known U.S position which has been been talked about for long period
                            of time but this was not subject of discussion at all.</p>
                        <p>Query: You have talked about infantry forces. What can you tell us about
                            discussion of Japanese air and naval forces?</p>
                        <p>Reply: Not very much because it wasn’t mentioned. There wasn’t that kind
                            of detailed discussion.</p>
                        <p>Query: Did anybody say “We have got to have 100 jet interceptors” or
                            anything like that?</p>
                        <p>Reply: No.</p>
                        <p>Query: Six year plan could include buildup of Japanese air force?</p>
                        <p>Reply: Yes, and to that extent there was presentation of what thinking of
                            Japanese defense authorities has been. <note n="6" xml:id="d50fn6">In

                                been signed; the Soviet Union will support Japan’s application for
                                entry into the United Nations; detailed arrangements for a
                                commercial agreement and a fisheries agreement will be negotiated

                            <item>The major issues outstanding are: (a) the Soviet Union wants Japan
                                to recognize its sovereignty over the Kuriles and South Sakhalin,
                                while Japan is still claiming sovereignty over the southernmost
                                Kuriles and wants disposition of the remaining disputed territories
                                to be decided later by the Allied Powers involved; (b) the Soviet
                                Union wants Japan to prohibit passage through all straits connecting
                                with the Sea of Japan by non-riparian powers, while Japan objects to
                                this provision; and (c) the Soviet condition that the Habomais and
                                Shikotan be demilitarized.</item>

                            <item>Hatoyama may well decide that the time has come for Japan to reach
                                agreement with the Soviets. We have had information from Tokyo that
                                Hatoyama may be in a mood for compromise, particularly in view of
                                his shaky political position and the recent decline in the influence
                                of <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>, who has been
                                the most outspoken advocate of hard bargaining with the Soviets. The

                            <item>Our policy has been to avoid any appearance of interfering with
                                the talks, although we have given Japan advice on a number of points
                                and have made clear that any agreements between Japan and the Soviet
                                Union must not conflict with the San Francisco Treaty and our
                                Security Treaty. Japan will almost certainly continue to reject the
                                Soviet position on the straits as outlined in paragraph 3(b). This
                                is probably a bargaining point on the part of the Soviets.</item>

                                proposal to prohibit entry into the Japan Sea by warships of
                                non-riparian powers violates international law and would virtually
                                nullify the naval aspects of the US-Japan Security Treaty, <note

                                    modification by the Secretary, in telegram 609, this sentence
                                    reads: “Soviet proposal prohibit entry warships non-riparian

                                of the Habomais and Shikotan would appear to be an unjustifiable

                            <item>While not feeling strongly, <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> does
                                not believe we should give any advice to Japan regarding the Kuriles
                                and South Sakhalin at this time (point (a) above) on the ground that
                                Japan will probably be unwilling in any case to recognize Soviet
                                sovereignty over these areas. I believe, however, that it is
                                advisable to make perfectly clear to the Japanese our view that
                                Japan should do nothing implying recognition of the Soviet claim and
                                that the future disposition of these areas, like Formosa, should
                                await future international decision. I also believe that it is in
                                the United States interest to do what we can to prevent the Soviets
                                from strengthening their color of title to the Kuriles and Sakhalin.

                                the Department of Defense on the size of U.S. forces in Japan and
                                the size of the Japanese contribution to their support. (<hi

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                                >Gordon</persName></hi>: During my two-day visit to Japan starting
                            October 3, I expect to be asked a number of questions on defense
                            matters. I do not propose to negotiate with the Japanese on any of these
                            but I think it will be necessary for me to have the current thinking of
                            the Department of Defense on two major problems—the size of our forces
                            in Japan and Japan’s contribution to their support.</p>
                        <p>Any change in the strength of our forces in Japan will have an important
                            bearing on Japan’s economy and on the Japanese attitude toward their
                            defense contribution to us. As I understand our plans on the basis of
                            preparations for the talks with <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName>, we intend by July 1956 to reduce our ground
                            forces in Japan from about 66,500 men to about 29,000, while our air
                            strength of 39,000 and naval strength of 8,100 will remain about the
                            same. This would mean a reduction from a total of about 113,000 men to
                            about 76,000. I would appreciate confirmation of these figures as well
                            as any comments you care to make on our plans for reduction over the
                            next couple of years.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese will almost certainly press for a further reduction in their
                            contribution to our forces under Article XIV of the Administrative
                            Agreement. I believe that a repetition of last year’s prolonged and
                            acrimonious negotiations with the Japanese on this issue would prejudice
                            our efforts in accordance with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            policy to build political stability in Japan and encourage their
                            cooperation with us on defense matters. Therefore we should try to reach
                            a rapid settlement this year. It is my opinion that Japan will be most
                            reluctant to spend more than 140 billion yen for all defense purposes in
                            its coming fiscal year, an increase of 7.3 billion yen from the current
                            132.7, and that it will not substantially increase the figure of about
                            103 billion yen tentatively set in its current plans for the Japan
                            Defense Agency. I have accordingly attached two alternative schedules
                            either of which could be the position which the United States would seek
                            to achieve in negotiating with Japan on its JFY56 defense expenditures.
                            These schedules also provide for defense spending by Japan through
                                <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1959, although of course <pb
                                n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0153"/>the figures beyond <gloss
                                target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 56 would be subject to subsequent
                            negotiation and might then be revised upwards. I realize that the
                            implications of last year’s understanding with the Japanese could lead
                            us to press them for a considerably higher defense budget next year, but
                            I believe that it would be politically most unwise for us to do so. I
                            should therefore appreciate your concurrence in these schedules, either
                            of which reflects the kind of understanding I believe we should seek to
                            obtain.</p>
                        <p>Since I plan to leave on September 29 I should appreciate hearing from
                            you as soon as possible. If you wish I should be glad, before I go, to
                            meet with you to discuss these problems.</p>

                            <p>(Under its tentative six-year defense plan Japan plans to increase
                                spending for its Defense Agency by about 15–20 billion yen annually
                                and by <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1960 will reach somewhat
                                less than 200 billion yen. The estimated Defense Agency budget for
                                    <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 56 is 103 billion yen or an
                                increase of 16.2 billion yen over <gloss target="#t_JFY1"

                            <p>A. If the Japanese Government will alter its defense plan to include
                                an annual increase of ten billion yen in total defense costs now set
                                at 132.7 billion yen, the U.S. will agree to phase out support for
                                U.S. forces by <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1959 by accepting
                                an annual reduction of one-quarter of the funds allocated to the

                        <p>Secun 11. From <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>. I called on
                            Prime Minister this morning accompanied by Ambassador, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>. Meeting lasted well over
                            hour, during which Hatoyama exceptionally cordial but rather vague,
                            seeming miss point altogether on some occasions, dodged direct answer on
                            others. Following is summary his comments on principal points
                            raised:</p>
                        <p>US relations: Hatoyama several times stressed that he considered close
                            and friendly US: Japanese cooperation keystone his policy, was most
                            pleased with results recent Washington talks. Also said he considered
                            fact that he had emphasized and expanded basis for such cooperation was
                            principal reason for his continued popularity with Japanese people.</p>
                        <p>Japan-Soviet negotiations: He had impression negotiations would be
                            settled soon. Although liberals and some of public were pressing for
                            return Kuriles and South Sakhalin he believed that Japan had
                            relinquished her rights to these at signing San Francisco treaty.
                            However Japan would insist on return Habomai and Shikotan “without
                            conditions”, would not accede to Russian insistence on limited
                            navigation rights Japan Sea and other waters. He did not believe
                            Japanese detainees would be returned prior to making treaty settlement.
                            I counseled patience pointing out that Soviet negotiators would
                            undoubtedly follow customary tactic of refusing make agreement until
                            last possible concession extracted from Japanese, but Hatoyama only
                            nodded agreement and did not comment.</p>
                        <p>Conservative unity: I mentioned deep US interest in seeing some solution
                            to problem political stability in Japan and asked about progress
                            conservative merger. Hatoyama replied that success current
                            Democratic-Liberal negotiations still very much in doubt. He admitted
                            fact that Liberals anxious avoid dissolution was factor favoring merger
                            and said he hoped it could be achieved. However, he continued believe
                            that merger based on shaky foundation (with possibility future split)
                            would be useless. He said he would much prefer have election and
                            increase strength Democratic Party. If merger became impossible he
                            considered it best hold election “as soon as possible.” Prime Minister
                            believed Democrats would be better prepared for elections this time,
                            might not win decisive majority but could gain at least 40 seats. He
                            pointed to results recent public opinion polls which indicated both he
                            and Democratic Party still extremely popular.</p>

                        <p>Trade with Communist China: I stressed fact US public opinion very
                            sensitive on question Communist China and that any indication Japan
                            intended enter into relations with mainland government would create
                            unfavorable reaction. While I explained we understood Japan’s desire
                            expand trade, I pointed out that Japanese Government should take pains
                            to put any such arrangements into proper context in order avoid
                            misunderstanding. Hatoyama replied that trade with Chinese Nationalists
                            now greatly exceeded that with mainland but that Japan urgently felt
                            need recapture lost markets in Commie China. He said he understood
                            feeling US people because of Communist Chinese participation Korean war
                            and said Japan did not intend “go any further” than expansion trade
                            relations. He added he believed Japanese public opinion valued good
                            Japanese-American relations more than anything else and said government
                            would exercise caution in dealing with Communist Chinese.</p>

                            pointed out US aid program in Far East expanding and that considerable
                            buying would naturally be done Japan. He pointed out that now would be
                            time for Japanese industry to develop to meet this demand as substitute
                            for offshore procurement. Hatoyama made vague reply, suggesting he would
                            like fit in such program with Philippine and Indonesian reparations
                            problems. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> continued
                            that of course capital essential for such development and that

                            in order allow Japan get fair share trade. We both pointed out little
                            basis for fear foreign economic domination through these means.</p>
                        <p>Hatoyama agreed that encouragement foreign capital investment “vitally
                            important,” said he had been impressed by Sakuma Dam project where US
                            technical assistance had produced amazing results. He said he also
                            keenly aware necessity for Japan recapture South East Asian market from
                            Communist China and other countries who have moved in.</p>

                                thereafter. I emphasized we had no concern with Japanese internal
                                affairs but were aware of vital importance of stable political base
                                in meeting Communist threat. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"

                                to our plans. I observed we felt we had identity of interest with
                                Japan, that we both had same goal in mind—to see Japan able to stand
                                firmly on its own feet. In discussion defense problem with <persName

                            for Conservative Party merger, he commented that there was virtually no

                            international issues. On defense matters, <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName>’s principal comment was that defense forces
                            agreement should be concluded soonest. When he brought up subject of
                            Japanese-Russian negotiations, I observed that experience had taught us
                            to remain firm and patient and related the Austrian experience as
                            illustration.</p>

                            stand ready to cooperate with Korea when opportunity presented itself.

                        <p>On September 27, 1955, the Intelligence Advisory Committee approved an
                            estimate on probable developments in Japan over the next decade. The
                            principal conclusions are as follows:</p>
                        <p>Japan is unlikely within the next ten years to develop sufficient power
                            and prestige to play a major role as a leader or defender of the
                            non-Communist Far East. Given favorable international circumstances,
                            however, it should make gradual progress in overcoming its serious
                            political and economic problems and become a valuable adjunct of free
                            world power in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Because of its security and economic needs Japan will remain basically
                            aligned with the US. But in its quest for a more independent position it
                            will become more assertive towards the US and will seek to improve its
                            relations with the Communist bloc and with the countries of free
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese must expand their economy considerably to sustain a large
                            and growing population at tolerable levels of consumption and
                            employment. The requisite export expansion will depend importantly on
                            factors beyond Japan’s control such as the level of world trade, the
                            reduction of trade barriers, and the rate of economic growth in
                            underdeveloped areas. Because of its imbalance in dollar trade Japan
                            will need US assistance for at least the next few years.</p>
                        <p>Japan will continue to rely on the US for strategic security but will
                            seek an equal voice in arrangements for the defense of Japan and is
                            unlikely over the long term to agree to the continuation in Japan of
                            bases under exclusive US control. It will strengthen its own defense
                            forces, with emphasis on the air force and navy, but its over-all effort
                            will be limited.</p>
                        <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0161"/>
                        <p>The conservatives will probably remain in office during the next decade
                            except possibly for brief interludes of Socialist control. However, they
                            will probably not provide strong leadership for some time to come.</p>
                        <p>Prolonged economic distress would weaken moderate political forces,
                            encourage extremist parties of both right and left, and probably lead
                            eventually to an ultra-nationalist resurgence. In the event of an
                            imminent threat of general war, Japan might attempt to assume a neutral
                            position in an effort to avoid nuclear destruction.</p>

                            have discussed at length problem of Japanese defense budget with
                            particular reference to Japanese contribution to <gloss
                                target="#t_USFJ1">USFJ</gloss>. We agree that last August exchange
                            of notes made clear that reduction in Japanese contribution to 38
                            billion yen was for one year only and that para 9 of confidential
                            Japanese note of August 20 clearly stated that any reduction in next
                            fiscal year would be from the full amount of 55.8 billion yen ($155
                            million), and that appropriation of more than 86.3 billion for <gloss
                                target="#t_JDA1">JDA</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>
                            56 would be the basis for considering any reduction of the yen
                            contribution in <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 56.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, we are convinced, as result of rereading August exchange
                            of notes, that if we propose in first instance position previously
                            advocated by Embassy, <note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">In telegram 921 from

                                    <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1955 yen contributions and
                                Japanese defense spending were ambiguous enough so that it was not
                                obligatory for the parties to compute the reduction of the yen
                                contribution for <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1956 from the
                                old ($155 million) base figure:<p>“Basic objection to reversion to
                                    $155 million is that it appears make impossible increase in
                                    Defense Agency budget over <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>
                                    55 figure of 86.3. Defense position would allow increase in
                                        <gloss target="#t_DA1">DA</gloss> budget only if total
                                    defense budget exceeds 149 billion yen whereas, regardless their
                                    economic capabilities, Japanese not willing accede to budget
                                    much over 140 billion yen. Even if US agreed to reduction from
                                    155 million equivalent to full increase (without 50–50 sharing)
                                    in Defense Agency budget and additional defense costs, total
                                    budget would still be at minimum about 150 billion yen.” (<hi

                            thereby officially imply that <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0162"
                            />we take lightly formal inter-governmental agreements less than six
                            months old. We might thereby also cast doubt on all future agreements we
                            may sign, in light clear understanding given Japanese in agreement and
                            negotiations that concessions for <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 55
                            “extraordinary measure”, not to be anticipated in future.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand we also agree that the present political situation in
                            Japan makes it most unlikely that the present Japanese Government will
                            or can agree to a total defense budget including contribution to <gloss
                                target="#t_USFJ1">USFJ</gloss> of more than the minimum figure
                            mentioned involved in the exchange of notes of August 1955, i.e., 148.1
                            billion yen including 6 billion for rentals of facilities used by US
                            Forces Japan which the Japanese were told would be basis from which to
                            consider any reduction in yen contribution.</p>
                        <p>In fact, Japanese press reports (undoubtedly inspired by the Japanese
                            Government) indicate that the Japanese intend to propose a figure even
                            lower than that called for by the August notes. Published estimates of
                            103 billion yen for <gloss target="#t_JDA1">JDA</gloss> and 30 billion
                            for <gloss target="#t_USFJ1">USFJ</gloss> would indicate a Japanese
                            total figure of around 139 to 143 billion yen, depending on the size of
                            the rentals appropriation.</p>
                        <p>The principal risk involved in prolonged pressure on our part to get a
                            substantially greater defense appropriation is that the Japanese people
                            tend increasingly to interpret such pressure as interference in Japanese
                            internal affairs. The publicity engendered [by?] unduly protracted
                            negotiations will inevitably be adverse publicity from US viewpoint. At
                            worst, protracted unproductive negotiations might provoke a Cabinet
                            crisis and delay merger of conservative forces. In essence, the problem
                            is to weigh the military value of a defense increase against the
                            political cost to the US. We agree that negotiations should not be
                            prolonged beyond the point at which there is no reasonable hope of an
                            increase in defense expenditures of sufficient magnitude to outweigh the
                            political damage to our position and to that of the conservatives.</p>
                        <p>We, therefore, request approval of the following courses of action:</p>

                            probably predicated in good part on belief agreement on general formula
                            will offset criticism of budgetary increase. US failure to seek agreed

                            Cabinet would be considerably changed. He also commented that the merger
                            of the two parties was a hopeful development, and that the single
                            conservative party would have a good working majority in the Japanese
                            Diet.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>’s briefing,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he wished
                            to make a statement. He said that some months ago we had discussed our
                            military deployments in Japan, as had the Secretary of State, with Prime
                            Minister Hatoyama. <note n="5" xml:id="d60fn5">Perhaps a reference to

                            discussions the Defense Department had come to feel that it would be
                            desirable to withdraw some of our forces from Japan, By doing so we
                            should help the Japanese to get forward with their own efforts to build
                            a defensive military establishment. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName>, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName>, agrees with this line of thought.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> estimated that we
                            now had approximately 117,000 Army troops in the Far East. The initial
                            plan was that this number should be reduced to approximately 90,000.
                            Very recently, however, the Army had informed Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> that they would prefer the level
                            of Army forces in the Far East to stand at 98,000. The Defense
                            Department, however, wants to stick to the 90,000 figure. Accordingly,
                            the authorities in the Defense Department are currently talking of
                            leaving two Army divisions in Korea, a regiment in Okinawa, and two
                            regiments in Japan. Altogether this accounted for three divisions. The
                            Marine Corps personnel will be brought back and stationed in Hawaii.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> indicated that
                            he was now in the process of trying to secure agreement within the
                            Pentagon that this was the right program for deployment of Army forces
                            in the Far East, and that he would appreciate support from the State
                            Department for this program.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> commented that
                            carrying out the program would amount to a net reduction of 30,000 in
                            the total of U.S. Army forces in Japan. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added that this would leave
                            about 35,000 in Japan, or approximately half the present strength of
                            Army personnel based in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said that he
                            believed that the State Department would agree in general with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s program. At the
                            present time, however, the State Department was heavily engaged in
                            financial negotiations with Japan, and he wanted advice as to whether to
                            tell the Japanese of our redeployment plans during the negotiations or
                            after their conclusion. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> said he believed that it was <pb n="139"
                                xml:id="pg_139" facs="0167"/>fairer to tell the Japanese of our
                            plans prior to the conclusion of the negotiations. We would certainly
                            want any reduction of the Japanese yen contribution to maintaining U. S.
                            forces in Japan to be transferred to the maintenance of their own
                            defense establishment.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired whether it was not customary for the
                            President to give approval to plans involving deployment or redeployment
                            of U.S. forces. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            replied that the President had already indicated general agreement to
                            the proposed redeployment plans for Japan. The reason that the issue had
                            come up again was the Army’s desire to change the over-all figure from
                            90,000 to 98,000.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that he presumed that if the State Department
                            went along with the program there would be no difficulty.</p>

                            parties, the Democratic Party of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_HI1">Ichiro Hatoyama</persName> and the Liberal Party of
                            Taketora Ogata, merged on November 15 to form a unified
                            “Liberal-Democratic Party”. All Democratic members of the Diet joined
                            the unified party whereas three Liberals, including former Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName>, chose to remain
                            outside the new party. The election of a party president has been
                            deferred until April, when presumably Hatoyama will retire and Ogata
                            will take over. In the interim a caretaker “proxy committee” consisting
                            of Hatoyama (D), Ogata (L), Miki (D),<note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3">Takeo

                                May–July 1954.</note> will administer party affairs. At a meeting of
                            Hatoyama and Ogata on the 14th, it was <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140"
                                facs="0168"/>agreed that Hatoyama would head the new cabinet and
                            would be in charge of governmental business while Ogata would be
                            responsible for party affairs. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> (D), who visited the United States with Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>, is the
                            Secretary-General of the new party. It is planned that the present
                            Cabinet will resign on November 21 and that Hatoyama will be re-elected
                            as Prime Minister when the extraordinary session of the Diet is convoked
                            on the 22nd. The new Cabinet reportedly will be composed of nine former
                            Democrats and seven former Liberals, and <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> will continue as Foreign Minister and Deputy
                            Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the merger the unified Liberal-Democratic Party now holds
                            300 out of 467 seats in the House of Representatives and 118 out of 250
                            in the House of Councillors. As a result of the unification of the
                            Socialists on October 13, the Socialists hold 155 and 69 seats
                            respectively. The conservative “Green Breeze Club” in the House of
                            Councillors (47 members) will probably support the
                            Liberal-Democrats.</p>

                                    been postponed, not settled. There is no single strong man to
                                    enforce party discipline. However, the external threat of the
                                    Socialists will probably prevent the breaking up of the

                                    necessary. United States “advice” or pressure in regard to
                                    defense would probably be ineffective. A majority conservative
                                    government is likely to have an increased sense of
                                    self-confidence, independence and determination to carry out its
                                    own decisions. Conservative leaders will, without undue
                                    deference to the United States, feel that the United States is
                                    obliged to cooperate with and support them regardless of our
                                    approval or disapproval of their methods and timing, since
                                    presumably we have no one else to whom we can turn. This will be
                                    partially offset by the fact that conservative leaders know that
                                    Japan must rely heavily on the United States in the

                                files.</note> which I hope may be of use to you on the Bonin
                            question. For a few Department eyes only I would like to add the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>The basic difficulty is and always has been the rooted determination of
                            the Navy to keep foreigners, particularly Japanese, out of the islands
                            they administer. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> has
                            personally been committed to this for years. The Navy simply dug in
                            right after the war and has fought tooth and nail ever since to hold the
                            line. This makes me suspect that alleged “security” considerations are
                            really rationalizations in defense of Navy policy, rather than reasons
                            on which national policy should logically be decided. One line of
                            thought which I imagine is present though seldom if ever put on paper
                            is: returning residents to former Japanese islands promotes reversionism
                            and is therefore an entering wedge for eventual loss of control whereas
                            the islands might some day be valuable to us. <note n="3"

                                    Islanders it would seem that the Japanese Government had some
                                    other motive in urging for repatriation. Mr. Tanaka replied that
                                    repatriation was all the Japanese Government wished at the
                                    present time but that it wished to make good its claim for the
                                    future to both the Ryukyus and the Bonins and would very much
                                    like the United States Government to announce that the Ryukyus
                                    and the Bonins would be returned to Japan in the future.”

                            so, the argument should be frankly laid on the table by the Navy,
                            specifying what they want the islands for and when. Then these purposes
                            could be weighed against our other national objectives.</p>

                        <p>In addition, so many of the arguments which are adduced, like the one
                            mentioned in the enclosed letter, are so obviously flimsy that the whole
                            subject needs airing before an impartial tribunal. I would like to
                            suggest the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> for this purpose. It is
                            unusually well adapted for short-circuiting obstructions in the
                            Pentagon. Also it could effectively handle one of the cleverest of the
                            Navy’s stratagems—the interest of another agency in the Bonins, which is
                            sometimes cited.</p>

                                    unabashedly based their opposition to the return of the Japanese

                                    Western descent should constitute a security threat when the
                                    return of those of Western descent did not constitute such a
                                    threat. They were frank in stating that the difference in

                            which would have set the Japanese defense budget at 163 billion yen. The
                            Japanese Government, however, owing largely to the position of the
                            Finance Ministry, was leaning in mid-December to a total just under $140

                        <p>(c) Defense wants the Japanese to be advised of the importance of an
                            adequate Japanese defense effort and of the prospect that we can place
                                <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> orders in Japan up to $20

                            specific figures where congressional action on the very delicate problem
                            of foreign aid is involved.</p>
                        <p>(d) Because the Japanese Cabinet believes that Japan can not spend more
                            than 140 billion yen for defense in the next fiscal year (Tokyo’s 1407,
                            Tab C)<note n="6" xml:id="d65fn6">See <ref target="#d63">Document
                                    63</ref>.</note> and because of the need to help the
                            conservatives in Japan achieve greater stability, I believe that we
                            should be prepared to settle quickly at the figure of 140 billion yen if
                            the Japanese do not accept the proposal of 142.7 billion yen. Defense is
                            not happy at the prospect of going any lower than the figure last
                            recommended by the Ambassador and <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName>. Defense however agreed to paragraph four of

                            140 billion yen if Tokyo reports that this is necessary to reach prompt
                            agreement.</p>

                            sufficiently covers the points contained in Tokyo’s 1435 but we have not
                            yet had a chance to consult with Defense. I have however added a
                            paragraph to the outgoing telegram to the effect that we might think our
                            message covers the points made in 1435.</p>

                            resumption of Japanese economic activities in the trust area, and the
                            release of Japanese war criminals, and left a brief informal memorandum
                            on these subjects. <note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">Attached to the source
                                text, but not printed. In the section on the Bonins, the memorandum
                                stated the Japanese Government had recently requested the
                                repatriation of 2,639 islanders whose return was particularly
                                desired. If this was found difficult for military or security
                                reasons, Japan desired, according to the memorandum, the
                                repatriation of a smaller number on a trial basis in a manner that
                                would not prejudice the security of U.S. forces in the area.</note>
                            He said that the Japanese Government had raised the first two problems
                            with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, and
                            understood that the Department would consult with other Government
                            agencies in an endeavor to find a solution to these problems. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName> confirmed that this
                            was correct. The Secretary commented that these are difficult security
                            problems, but that we would look into them with the other Departments
                            concerned. In the case of war criminals, the Secretary thought that we
                            had made considerable progress but pointed out that difficulties had
                            arisen in connection with the release of German war criminals.</p>

                        <p>1596. Reference: Embtel 1595. <note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">In telegram
                                1595, January 13, the Embassy reported in part that the Japanese
                                Government appeared to be so opposed to the U.S. version of a
                                general formula for progressive annual reduction in the yen
                                contribution to maintenance of U.S. forces in Japan that it was
                                willing, rather than accept the U.S. proposal, to risk commencing
                                negotiations the following year on the basis of the old $155 million
                                figure. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 794.5/1–1356)</note> As
                            indicated in reference telegram, we have now reached impasse on problem
                            of general formula. Three basic courses of action are open to us: (1) to
                            accept formula proposed by Japanese; (2) to stipulate in notes that next
                            year’s negotiations start from $155 million as provided in
                            administrative agreement; and (3) to agree that starting point for next
                            year will be 30 billion yen, recognizing thereby that previous
                            reductions in yen contribution are final.</p>
                        <p>Third alternative appears least desirable since it would provide
                            concession desired by Japanese without parallel agreement on their part
                            to matching principle which would assure that at least 50 percent of
                            increase in defense agency budget will be borne by Japanese.</p>
                        <p>With respect first two alternatives, advantages and disadvantages need be
                            carefully weighed. Principal reasons for accepting Japanese formula are
                            those that motivated my initial support for general formula, namely
                            desirability of placing US-Japanese defense relationships on smoother
                            basis and avoiding danger of acrimonious annual negotiations implicit
                            under current arrangement. In addition, from practical viewpoint, it
                            will be increasingly difficult secure Japanese agreement in future years
                            to yen contribution greater than previous year irrespective of
                            provisions annual note. <gloss target="#t_USFJ1">USFJ</gloss> yen costs
                            are declining and furthermore Japanese are fully cognizant of German
                            efforts to eliminate entirely contribution to allied forces. Japanese
                            agreement to matching principle also would in effect provide more
                            favorable agreement than we have obtained in negotiations during past
                            two years.</p>
                        <p>On other hand, I am reluctant to make another concession to Japanese
                            since it is not absolutely required in terms of political stability
                            despite desirability of formula arrangement from viewpoint overall
                            US-Japanese relations. Furthermore, Japanese next year will probably be
                            in stronger position politically and economically and therefore able to
                            take pressure from us on defense matters without affecting political <pb
                                n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0181"/>stability. Finally, US proposed
                            formula is more consistent with last year’s agreement than is Japanese
                            formula—a point of importance to <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                            >FEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>While I would be inclined on balance to go along with Japanese on their
                            proposed general formula, I am not in position to secure <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName>’s agreement to a
                            joint recommendation along these lines. In securing previous joint
                            recommendations, I have overruled his serious objections made on
                            military grounds to the proposed concessions to the Japanese. I do not
                            feel that I can again ask for concessions to the Japanese without
                            endangering the goodwill existing between Embassy and Command. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> has previously gone
                            along with our views on the grounds that these concessions were required
                            to avoid an immediate threat to the political stability of the Japanese
                            Government. Since the Japanese may be willing to delay or even forego
                            agreement on a formula, it is difficult to justify to <gloss
                                target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> a further concession on similar
                            grounds.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, if the Department agrees that a general formula, if need be on
                            Japanese terms, should be sought during current negotiations, it will
                            have to come at its initiative and on basis of its assessment of overall
                            situation, including developments in Germany on similar problem of local
                            contributions.</p>
                        <p>Since foregoing was drafted I have learned from Suzuki of Finance
                            Ministry that Japanese Government does consider general formula (theirs,
                            not ours) <note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3"><persName corresp="#p_SM1"

                                i.e., net increase of JDAY and facility expenses. Formula proposed

                        <p>*Appropriations required to support six-year defense plan. (Government
                            approval of plan still contingent upon legislation establishing National

                        <p>2. The Embassy and <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> state that
                            acceptance of the Japanese formula would have the following advantages:
                            (a) Reduce Japanese pressure for revision of the Administrative
                            Agreement; (b) Retain matching principle which would provide inducement
                            for continued increase in Defense Agency budget; (c) Would facilitate
                            smoother working relationship with Japanese on defense matters. This
                            arrangement <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0183"/>is also more
                            favorable than that prescribed in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> policy for Japan, which simply says that we should seek
                            to ensure that Japan applies to its own forces any amount by which its
                            contribution to us is reduced.</p>
                        <p>3. The joint message lists the following as unfavorable considerations:
                            (a) The adoption of the formula would result in future reductions in the
                            yen contribution being from that of the previous year rather than from
                            the full support contribution of $155 million (55.8 billion yen) as
                            specified in the Administrative Agreement—It is our view that the
                            abandonment of this unrealistic negotiating position, which has been
                            adopted in the past without useful results, will do much to obviate the
                            possibility of prolonged and acrimonious negotiations, (b) Should the
                            Japanese seek reductions in addition to those provided for in the
                            formula, our initial position will be weaker than if we had started with
                            $155 million—We could counter the concession of agreeing to their
                            proposed formula, (c) We might be in a somewhat less advantageous
                            position to exert direct pressure on their Defense effort—The <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper provides that we should not press
                            Japan to increase its military strength to the prejudice of political
                            and economic stability.</p>
                        <p>4. We feel that agreement to the Japanese proposed formula would greatly
                            reduce exacerbations in future defense negotiations and make a
                            significant contribution to furthering our political objectives in Japan
                            by indicating United States agreement to a planned phase-out of the
                            Japanese contribution to our forces, which is viewed in Japan as the
                            continuation of an Occupation-type relationship.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary began by analyzing in some detail the changes in Soviet
                            policy over the past ten months, the possible reasons for the changes,
                            and their significance. Soviet policy in the ten years after World War
                            II had been based on the belief that Soviet goals could be accomplished
                            only by violence; when this policy failed, different policies had been
                            adopted. The change was apparent in the field of foreign policy and was
                            most recently evident in the doctrinal changes and in the rejection of
                            Stalinism at the 20th Party Congress. Though one could not be certain as
                            to the reasons for this drastic change of course, several things seemed
                            evident:</p>

                                Soviet Union, there must have been important internal pressures

                            <item>In the field of foreign policy the change must have been brought
                                about in large part by the growth and strengthening of collective
                                defense organizations among free nations, and the recognition that
                                the Soviet could not attack one nation without risking involvement
                                of the United States.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In the Secretary’s view, however, the change was a tactical one; Soviet
                            objectives remained the same. Soviet tactics now apparently were to
                            infiltrate neighboring countries, utilizing the large supply of
                            technicians and the industrial capabilities which the Soviets have built
                            up, and thereby to accomplish indirectly what they could not accomplish
                            by open assault.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, there was no assurance that the Soviets would not revert to
                            their old policy of violence if the free nations weakened in their
                            determination and failed to maintain their strength. The Secretary was
                            aware that the Japanese were particularly sensitive on the issue of
                            atomic and nuclear weapons, but it was essential that the United States
                            never permit the Soviets to gain supremacy in this field; our continued
                            supremacy in fact was the only real defense of the free world. The
                            development of nuclear weapons had now reached the point where our goal
                            was not to develop increased destructive power but to control their use
                            and make them more precise as weapons in order to limit the damage in
                            their use ever became necessary.</p>
                        <p>One of the primary purposes of the Secretary’s trip had been to appraise
                            the effect of the new Soviet policies in Southeast Asia. The Secretary
                            had found in Southeast Asia a clear awareness of the danger of Soviet
                            penetration and the risks involved in accepting Soviet aid. As a result
                            of his trip, he had concluded that the Soviet economic penetration
                            tactics were not likely to be successful, except in those cases where
                            the Soviets were able to exploit emotions aroused over historical
                            disputes, as had been the case with Egypt’s acceptance of Soviet aid to
                            strengthen her hand against Israel. In general, though there were
                            dangerous elements in the situation, e.g., in the hostility between
                            Pakistan and India, the Secretary had been pretty well satisfied that
                            the nations he visited were aware of the Soviet danger and were strongly
                            anti-Communist. On balance, the situation was better than he had thought
                            before visiting the area.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, the most striking change for the better he had noticed was
                            in Viet Nam. A year ago the situation had appeared all but hopeless;
                            however, President Diem had worked near miracles over the past year.
                            Viet Nam problems were not all solved, but they now appear to be of
                            manageable proportions.</p>
                        <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0186"/>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister asked what the Secretary’s impression had been in
                            Taiwan and the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary had found a greater degree of composure and confidence in
                            Taiwan than was the case a year ago, when there was great nervousness
                            that the offshore islands and Taiwan itself were about to be attacked.
                            Of course, there was no certainty even now that attacks would not take
                            place, but there was considerably more confidence in Taiwan, stemming of
                            course in large part from the fact that the security of Taiwan was
                            safeguarded through the Republic of China’s mutual defense treaty with
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>In Korea the Secretary had noted that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, whom he had not seen for 2½ years,
                            had aged perceptibly in the interval. The President had not been so
                            vigorously and even violently argumentative as in the past—even
                            concerning Japan. His sentiments probably had not changed; but he was
                            not so strong in pressing his views. There would perhaps be problems
                            when President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> left the
                            center of the Korean political scene, but the Secretary believed that
                            his successor would be likely to maintain the same close ties with the
                            United States as at present. The Secretary hoped, however, that a
                            successor regime would be less strongly anti-Japanese.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then outlined some of the basic principles of United States
                            policy in Asia. The Secretary recalled that our Atlantic policy, as
                            demonstrated by our action in the two World Wars, had been to prevent
                            hostile forces from gaining control of the far side of the Atlantic. We
                            have now developed a Pacific policy which in essence was the same as our
                            Atlantic policy: we sought to have friendly powers on the western shores
                            of the Pacific. Our participation in the Korean war, in addition to our
                            moral obligation under the U.N. Charter, had been in part motivated by
                            this belief; the Secretary had feared that if the Communists were
                            permitted to over-run the Korean peninsula, the situation might well
                            have developed into another world war.</p>
                        <p>Communist China had not concealed her ambition to control the Korean
                            peninsula, Formosa, the Philippines, Indo China, Indonesia. She thus
                            challenged the basic policy of the United States; and so long as
                            Communist China’s hostile policy continued, the United States would not
                            help her, economically or morally. Though the United States has been
                            accused of being “unrealistic” for not recognizing the existence of
                            Communist China, we recognized its existence all right; the question was
                            whether we should extend recognition and admission to the United Nations
                            and thereby strengthen her moral position. It was argued also that if we
                            adopted a different policy, Communist China would become more friendly
                            and amiable. We preferred, however, to have the Communists first
                            demonstrate their friendliness. We simply could not take the risk—any
                            more than we could have in the case of Hitler. Some argued also that it
                            was inevitable that Communist <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0187"
                            />China, as a major continental power, should dominate peninsular and
                            island countries on the continental periphery. History, however, taught
                            us exactly the opposite, as in the case of Greece, Britain, and the
                            European “peninsula” to the Asian land mass. In any event, we did not
                            accept it as inevitable that Communist China would dominate the western
                            Pacific, and we were determined to use our power to prevent such a thing
                            from happening. Our mutual defense pacts with free nations in the area,
                            including Japan, were indications of our determination in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>Turning to another subject, the Secretary said he was aware how deeply
                            Japan desired to be admitted to the United Nations. It was the
                            Secretary’s opinion that Japan would be likely to gain admission if the
                            Japanese firmly expressed their indignation toward the Russians for
                            excluding Japan and equating Japan with Outer Mongolia. The Soviets were
                            most anxious to establish close relations with Japan; and if Japan’s
                            indignation were made clear to them, the Secretary did not feel that
                            they would long block Japan’s admission.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that
                            unfortunately the Japanese people did not react this way; they were used
                            to having the Russians do strange, unreasonable things and could not
                            seem to build up any resentment over such cases of Russian
                            intransigence. Rather they tended in the case of the U.N. to put the
                            blame on the Taiwan Government for Japan’s exclusion. The same was true
                            with regard to the Japan-Soviet negotiations; the Soviets’ unreasonable
                            behavior aroused little resentment among the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that Japan had been a great nation, which had
                            played a great role in this part of the world. In the past Japan had
                            demonstrated her superiority over the Russians and over China when that
                            country acted alone, it was time for Japan to think again of being and
                            acting like a Great Power, and not accepting these insults from the
                            Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Chief Cabinet Secretary Nemoto said this was all very well in theory, but
                            that in practice Japan was much too weak and helpless even in relation
                            to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to do anything to protect her
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that ever since he had worked on the Peace Treaty in
                            Japan in 1951 he had been greatly impressed by the ability of the
                            Japanese people and their capabilities for exercising influence for
                            good. One of the major purposes of the United States was to see Japan
                            come back again as a Great Power in this part of the world. The
                            Secretary looked forward to the day when the United States would not
                            have to play such a large role here and Japan could resume her position
                            of leadership.</p>
                        <p>Defense Agency Director <persName corresp="#p_FN1">Funada</persName> said
                            that while Japan appreciated the generous peace treaty which had been
                            negotiated under the Secretary’s leadership, it was regrettable that the
                            Occupation-enacted <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0188"/>Constitution
                            had been permitted to remain in force, and the revision had been made so
                            difficult. A large share of Japan’s present troubles, especially in the
                            area of defense, stemmed from the restrictions which the Constitution
                            imposed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that, while he had not been in a position of
                            responsibility when the Constitution was prepared and was not aware of
                            the details of its formulation, he did realize that it constituted a
                            serious legal and psychological impediment for Japan. When the Foreign
                            Minister had visited Washington last summer, discussion had taken place
                            concerning the possibility of substituting a mutual security treaty for
                            the somewhat one-sided Security Treaty presently in force.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d70fn3">See <ref target="#d45">Document 45</ref>.</note> It
                            had been apparent however that Japan was not prepared spiritually, nor
                            did her Constitution permit her, to assume the equal responsibilities
                            which a truly mutual security treaty involved. It was academic though at
                            this stage to express regrets over the Constitution as formulated under
                            the Occupation. In the long run, a nation’s growth had never been
                            impeded by the restrictions of a Constitution; the Constitution must
                            adjust to the nation and its needs, rather than the nation to the
                            Constitution.</p>

                            the case of the joint communiqué in Washington last year,<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d70fn6">See <ref target="#d50">Document 50</ref>.</note>
                            that Japan was being called on to send her troops abroad to fight. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said he was sure the
                            Socialists would raise this matter in the Diet, and he wondered if the
                            Secretary would permit a denial that any such implication was contained
                            in the Secretary’s statement.</p>
                        <p>It developed that there had been a misunderstanding in translation of the
                            word “strategic”—the nearest Japanese equivalent for which has an
                            exclusively military connotation. The Secretary explained that in his
                            statement he had been thinking of “strategy” in its broader meaning—in
                            the sense of planning and policy in all fields including economic
                            matters. He had not meant to imply that in the military area Japan
                            should assume any greater obligation than she now has, namely, to
                            contribute increasingly to her own defense. The Secretary authorized the
                            Japanese to make public clarification of this <pb n="161"
                                xml:id="pg_161" facs="0189"/>point, and it was agreed that after
                            consulting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1"
                                >Allison</persName>, Chief Cabinet Secretary Nemoto would make a
                            statement to the press after the meeting ended.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> recalled jokingly
                            that when in Washington last summer he and his colleagues had promised
                            that a conservative merger would be realized before they met the
                            Secretary again. Well, they had done it. What would the Secretary like
                            to have them promise now?</p>
                        <p>In reply the Secretary said only that the United States regarded the
                            conservative merger as a very important achievement for Japan; if it had
                            not been achieved, he felt there might have been a real danger that
                            Japan would simply fall apart.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Japan-Soviet negotiations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> said that they were not going very well. From a
                            variety of sources, including Domnitsky of the former Soviet Mission, it
                            had been reported that the Soviets were seriously considering “drawing a
                            line” on the high seas to exclude Japanese fishermen from North Pacific
                            fishing areas; it had also been reported that because of Soviet naval
                            maneuvers Japanese operations in the Sea of Okhotsk might not be
                            permitted. These threats, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>
                            understood, were designed to “force” Japanese acceptance of Soviet terms
                            in negotiating a peace treaty. If these threats were carried out, the
                            effect on the Japanese fishing industry would be far more serious than
                            that resulting from Korean enforcement of the <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> Line.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was not familiar with the details of Japan’s
                            negotiations with the Soviets. However, if there appeared to be a real
                            possibility of the Soviets taking such action on the high seas, it might
                            be well for Japan and the United States to sit down together, study the
                            problem and see what could be done. The Secretary pointed out that the
                            United States had experienced considerable difficulty with some Latin
                            American nations over assertion of territorial sovereignty on the high
                            seas, and that in this respect the interests of Japan and the United
                            States largely coincided.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> then
                            suggested that some discussion should be devoted to Japan’s pressing
                            economic problem, made more urgent by the need to support Japan’s large
                            and expanding population. In the Foreign Minister’s view the problem,
                            particularly in Southeast Asia, could be effectively dealt with only
                            through close cooperation with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Minister Ichimada said that one important means of countering the
                            Communist threat was to raise the level of living conditions in
                            Southeast Asia. The trouble was that Southeast Asia badly needed
                            capital, without which there was a danger that Japan’s reparations
                            payments to the area might go to waste. In this connection, Mr. Ichimada
                            had been most favorably impressed by Eric Johnston’s proposals during
                            his recent visit to Tokyo. The Finance Minister hoped to <pb n="162"
                                xml:id="pg_162" facs="0190"/>discuss the problems in detail later
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName>; at this time
                            he wished only to emphasize that the Southeast Asian area was of vital
                            importance, and that it deserved a larger share of capital investment
                            than it was receiving. He noted that of World Bank loans, only 12% was
                            allotted to Southeast Asian areas.</p>
                        <p>Minister Takasaki pointed out that a reparations settlement had already
                            been reached with Burma, and that agreements with the Philippines and
                            Indonesia would be reached soon. This would mean that Japan would be
                            sending into the area sixty to seventy million dollars in capital goods
                            as reparations every year. However, these nations did not have
                            sufficient capital of their own to utilize the reparations payments
                            effectively; Mr. Takasaki noted that of the interim reparations shipped
                            to these areas immediately after the war, the major portion had been
                            allowed to go to waste. Capital in these countries was therefore badly
                            needed. If Japan were to offer it, however, she would naturally be
                            suspected of attempting to “infiltrate” and “dominate” the area. Similar
                            suspicions toward Britain and the United States might develop in these
                            countries which have so recently won their independence if either of
                            these nations were to sponsor a unilateral investment program. The need
                            in Mr. Takasaki’s view was for a joint capital investment and loan
                            program, in which all free nations with interest in the area would
                            participate, thereby removing suspicion that any single nation was
                            attempting to dominate the receiving nation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Takasaki</persName> said further that there was an urgent
                            need to develop Southeast Asia’s export potentialities. As it was now,
                            the area had little to export but rice. But if basic raw material
                            industries were developed, e.g., iron ore mines in the Philippines,
                            these nations would have something valuable to sell Japan, and would of
                            course be able to greatly expand their purchase of Japanese goods in
                            return.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out in the first place that by far the greater
                            share of direct economic aid under the American aid program went to
                            these areas, and that this more than balanced the fact that their share
                            of World Bank loans was relatively limited. The Secretary was not
                            familiar with Eric Johnston’s proposals and could not comment on them.
                            However, the idea of cooperation in this field appealed to him strongly,
                            and in principle he believed it might be useful to study the possibility
                            of coordinating United States economic assistance with the reparations
                            program.</p>
                        <p>As the meeting ended, the Secretary said the talk today had been most
                            informative and useful—more so in fact than any talk he had had in Japan
                            since his work on the Japan Peace Treaty in 1951. Foreign <pb n="163"

                                >Shigemitsu</persName> in return expressed his deep appreciation for
                            the opportunity to speak frankly and exchange views with the
                                Secretary.<note n="7" xml:id="d70fn7"><p>In <gloss

                                <p>“It was the best talk I have ever had with Japanese leaders, and
                                    it gave the impression first that they are beginning to feel
                                    that we can be treated as real partners and secondly that they
                                    are beginning to try to find a place for Japan in the postwar
                                    scheme of things.” (Department of State, Central Files,

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the Prime Minister had any particular matters
                            which he wished to bring up. Mr. Hatoyama replied that he had nothing in
                            particular which he wished to raise but that he would like to discuss a
                            few matters involving basic principles. He recalled that former British
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CSWS1">Churchill</persName> had
                            delivered a speech at Blackpool<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">Reference is
                                to the speech delivered at the close of the Conservative Party
                                Conference in Blackpool, England, October 9, 1954.</note> at which
                            he had made the point that peace had been maintained through strength,
                            and that the present peaceful condition <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164"
                                facs="0192"/>of the world was primarily due to the fact that the
                            United States had sufficient strength to counter the Soviet Union.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CSWS1">Churchill</persName> had pointed out
                            that if the Soviet had possessed a preponderant degree of strength
                            England would have been invaded long ago. The Prime Minister said that
                            he had always believed in and followed this policy. He asked the
                            Secretary whether he was right in so doing. He added that he hoped that
                            the United States would continue to maintain her strength and asked
                            whether his hopes were justified.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that the Prime Minister was right in both
                            respects. He noted that Admiral Mahan had said that the role of force
                            was to give moral institutions an opportunity to take root and grow.
                            United States power acted as an umbrella over the Free World and
                            provided an opportunity for free institutions to become strong. With
                            regard to the degree of strength which the United States now possessed
                            in relation to that held by the Soviet Union, the Secretary said that he
                            did not know the exact figures and could not say. However he noted that
                            the United States had recently offered to make available 40,000
                            kilograms of fissionable material for use by friendly countries in
                            developing peaceful atomic research. He said that this had come as a big
                            surprise to many who had no idea that United States resources in this
                            respect were on so large a scale. In any event they were many times that
                            of the Soviet Union, and, together with the striking power provided by
                            our numerous bases throughout the world, made our retaliatory power so
                            great that it would be madness for the Soviet Union to challenge it by
                            aggression. The Secretary said that it seems apparent that this power
                            has created a genuine deterrent to war and has thus effectively limited
                            the Soviet Union to such indirect action as attempting to create trouble
                            between non-communist nations such as Israel and Egypt or Pakistan and
                            India. The Secretary advised the Prime Minister to be confident that so
                            long as the United States and Japan are allies, Japan will be protected
                            by the greatest possible strength and that the United States is
                            determined to preserve its power.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that when he had spoken recently with
                                <persName>William Randolph Hearst, Jr.</persName>, Hearst had asked
                            him what Japan wished from the United States. The Prime Minister had
                            replied that he wanted first for the United States to protect Japan from
                            Soviet aggression, and second, for the United States to have faith in
                            Japan—that Japan was a solid member of the Free World and would continue
                            to be.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled his speech of May, 1951 delivered before the

                                before the America–Japan Society in Tokyo,
                                    <persName>Dulles</persName> discussed the security relationship
                                between the two countries. For text, see Department of State <hi

                                23, 1951, also in Tokyo, <persName>Dulles</persName> addressed the
                                United Nations Association of Japan on the topic “Peace Without

                                726.</note> in which he had discussed the whole <pb n="165"
                                xml:id="pg_165" facs="0193"/>subject of the U.S.-Japan security
                            relationship and said that the policy which he had expressed then still
                            stands.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan was vitally interested in developing
                            close relations with the nations of Southeast Asia and also in promoting
                            close relations among those nations themselves. He pointed out that
                            Japan was, at considerable sacrifice, endeavoring to pay reparations to
                            all these countries. However, Japan was most interested in making sure
                            that these reparations were put to effective use. Some sort of
                            development organization, financed by the United States, which would
                            enable these underdeveloped countries to put these funds to use was
                            necessary. The Prime Minister hoped that the United States would give
                            favorable consideration to this plan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he shared the Prime Minister’s view and agreed
                            that Japan could not really afford to pay reparations unless their
                            effect would be to create economic prosperity. Reparations could not be
                            sterile—it would be a waste which Japan could not afford. The Secretary
                            assured the Prime Minister that he would have his experts study the
                            problem from this standpoint. He pointed out that he himself was not an
                            expert but that he certainly believed the principle to be sound.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then said he had great hopes for a betterment of
                            Korean-Japanese relations and asked that the United States do what it
                            could to see this problem settled.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the United States too was anxious to see an
                            end to the difficulties between Japan and Korea but said that we face a
                            difficult but temporary problem in the fanaticism exhibited by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>. He said that he
                            characterized the problem as temporary because no one lives forever and
                            even President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> is no
                            exception.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister rejoined that Japan has exhibited a great deal of
                            patience with the Korean problem and will continue to be as forbearing
                            as possible. However, the issues involved were becoming sensational
                            ones. The people who fish from the western coasts of Japan are being
                            adversely affected and becoming more and more angry. He mentioned that
                            the Korean patrols do not seem to bother old vessels operating within
                            the <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Line but make it a point
                            to seize all the new vessels in good condition. [<hi rend="italic">1

                        <p>The Secretary replied that the United States too has had its problems
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and that we
                            recognize his fanatic and frequently irrational attitude. At the same
                            time it had to be admitted that <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0194"
                                /><persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> is a dedicated man who
                            has contributed a great deal to the checking of communist expansion in
                            this area and whose country has sacrificed much. In some ways his
                            actions have operated to the direct advantage of both Japan and the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he wished to bring up a problem which might
                            seem small in relation to the big ones under discussion. He referred to
                            the natives of the Bonin islands who are still in Japan and prevented
                            from returning to their homes. He asked that the Secretary bear this
                            problem in mind and give some consideration to finding a solution.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he had studied the problem and that at first
                            he had been inclined to believe that the islanders should be allowed to
                            return. However, the more he studied the problem the less confident he
                            became. In the first place it was apparent that the islands could not
                            sustain much population. Secondly, he did not want to create a situation
                            which might become similar to that which Cyprus has become for Great
                            Britain. The islands have a strategic value for the United States and
                            the Free World. It was quite possible that after the islanders had been
                            returned they would want more and more. The problem would not be solved
                            merely by sending the residents back even though the immediate
                            difficulty might be temporarily calmed. It was necessary to view the
                            problem on a long range basis—not as something which could be settled by
                            the simple expedient of allowing the islanders to go home. In the long
                            run he believed that letting the Bonin islanders return might do more
                            harm to Japanese-American relations than good.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he did not wish to fill the Secretary with
                            details which he did not want to hear and that he had been keeping the
                            Embassy informed of developments, but that if the Secretary had any
                            questions which he would like to ask concerning the current Japan-Soviet
                            negotiations or Japan’s policy toward Communist China, he would be happy
                            to answer them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that he had discussed Japan’s negotiations with
                            the Soviet Union at some length on the preceding day when he met with
                            various Japanese leaders. He had pointed out at that time that Japan had
                            a greater capacity to obtain results from the Soviet than she realized.
                            He believed that the Soviet Union wanted to obtain a treaty and wanted
                            Japanese friendship, and he believed that the weapon of public opinion
                            could be used more effectively than it had been so far. In the first
                            place there was the question of the return of Japanese prisoners from
                            the Soviet Union. The Russians had agreed to return these people over
                            eleven years ago. The Secretary recalled that he had attended the
                            meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in 1945 just after the
                            surrender terms had been agreed to by the Japanese <pb n="167"

                            then Secretary of State Byrnes had raised the question of the Japanese
                            prisoners who, according to the surrender terms, were to be returned to
                            lead peaceful lives after Japan had been disarmed. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> had then said,
                            jokingly but revealingly, that the clause had been inserted in the
                            surrender terms merely in order to induce the Japanese to surrender.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that it was
                            foolish to make new agreements before old ones had been carried out. So
                            long as the Soviets can use the same bargaining counter over and over
                            again—sell the same horse twice—they will do so. The Secretary believed
                            that there could and should be much greater moral indignation at such
                            perfidy. In the second place, the Secretary believed that it had been a
                            most insulting thing for the Soviet Union to equate Japan with Outer
                            Mongolia—a country which was not really a country at all, and certainly
                            not to be compared with Japan. He believed that if public opinion were
                            to rise up on this issue the Soviets would give in. The Austrian peace
                            treaty was finally achieved by just such patient use of public
                            opinion—year after year reminding the world from every forum available
                            that the Soviet Union had agreed at the conclusion of the war to give
                            Austria back her independence. Finally they had given in because they
                            felt the effect of world opinion. If Japan would do the same thing she
                            would get results.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether all Austrian prisoners had been returned
                            and whether Austrian figures on the number of prisoners held had agreed
                            with those provided by the Soviet.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that, as far as he knew, there was no problem or
                            dispute over Austrian prisoners. However, the situation in Germany was a
                            different one. There the Russians were still refusing to return or make
                            final accounting for numerous prisoners. They were trying to sell the
                            same horse three or four times!</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would be happy to hear the views of the
                            Japanese Government on the current Japan-Soviet negotiations but that he
                            was not familiar with the details.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister regretted that in Japan it had been impossible to whip
                            up Japanese public opinion in the same way that the United States had
                            been able to do in the case of the fifteen fliers held by the Communist
                            Chinese. In spite of the fact that a great deal more than fifteen had
                            been held by the Russians the people had not been so worked up.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it was because of the pressure of United States
                            public opinion that we had been able to secure the return of the fliers.
                            There were however still thirteen civilians held by the Chinese whom we
                            insisted on having returned.</p>
                        <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0196"/>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that on the subject of China he had also had a
                            profitable discussion the previous day with various Japanese leaders. He
                            did not wish to go into details but did wish to state basic United
                            States policy on this question. This was to ensure that the powers of
                            the Western Pacific (including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines,
                            Southeast Asia, New Zealand and Australia) remained friendly to us and
                            are internally and internationally strong enough to maintain their
                            independence against Communist Chinese expansion. So long as China
                            remains hostile to the Free World we oppose any action which may tend to
                            strengthen her morally or materially. This does not mean that we do not
                            accept the fact that the Chinese Communist regime exists. It does and we
                            have negotiated with it in the past. At the same time we are opposed to
                            anything which will build up its prestige and power so long as we feel
                            that that power will be used against us, or our friends in the West
                            Pacific. We believe that this policy coincides with Japanese interests.
                            We would however welcome free, intimate and continuous exchanges of
                            opinion with the Japanese government on this matter. Our basic purposes
                            are the same. Japan has had greater experience than we in dealing with
                            the Chinese and we would be most happy to cooperate in determining the
                            best policy with which to cope with China.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that trade was also important. He had noticed a
                            growth of trade between Japan and mainland China in terms of commodities
                            which were desirable to Japan and which did not involve the strategic
                            strengthening of China. We realize that this sort of trade may be
                            necessary and have therefore from time to time agreed to review our
                            lists of commodities banned from export to China, in the hope of helping
                            our friends. However, we do not think it is advisable for China to
                            receive commodities which will create greater strength for her.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister hoped that the Secretary would continue this policy of
                            review. At the same time he said that Japan had no desire to export
                            strategic material to the Communists. He asked that the Secretary have
                            faith in Japan and trust her. Japan was not going to become Communist.
                            She was a firm member of the Free World.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it was extremely gratifying to hear so forthright
                            a statement and that he was completely confident that Japan would remain
                            with the Free World.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister recalled that at the time he founded the Liberal Party
                            his very first statement had been that he was anti-Communist. For this
                            he had been purged. However, his attitude had not changed and was not
                            likely to in the future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Miki</persName> then said that he had listened with great
                            interest and appreciation to the Secretary’s remarks and wished to
                            endorse what the Prime Minister had said about having faith in Japan. He
                            wanted to <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0197"/>add however that it
                            was not just faith alone, it was more than that. He wanted the United
                            States to rest assured that Japan was on its side and have no worries.
                            He reemphasized that Japan was anti-Communist and was aware that it must
                            be strong. He said that the conservatives had been able to merge
                            themselves from a number of warring factions into a strong party. They
                            would revise the election laws and they would eventually carry out
                            revision of the Constitution. He was grateful for the aid which the
                            United States has given Japan so far and asked that it be continued even
                            more in the future.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that everything which he had done or said in the
                            past six years had shown his confidence in Japan. He was completely
                            assured that that confidence was justified. He said that he realized
                            that certain matters created difficulties from time to time but that
                            these were relatively minor viewed against the background of not only
                            words but deeds as well. The United States had made both a material and
                            a moral investment in Japan. The Secretary mentioned the great effort
                            which had gone into ensuring the passage of the Reciprocal Trade
                            Agreements Act last year which had paved the way for Japanese membership
                            in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. It was one of the most
                            difficult things that had been accomplished and had succeeded in passing
                            the House of Representatives by only one vote. He realized that United
                            States trade policy was not perfect but recalled that he had talked with
                            the British Ambassador a few weeks ago when the Ambassador had
                            complained about United States discrimination over British bicycle
                            imports. At that time he had said to the British Ambassador that a
                            pretty girl with a spot of dirt on her face attracted a lot of attention
                            and unfavorable comment whereas a coal miner whose face is covered with
                            dirt did not. United States trade policy was like the pretty girl—its
                            weak points were noticed a great deal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Miki</persName> then said that he wished to add one more
                            thing. He said that the Japanese leaders understood why the United
                            States had to do the things which it did. However, the Japanese people
                            did not always understand. On such problems as the Japanese-Korean
                            dispute they blamed the United States for not taking a firmer stand with
                            Korea and for furnishing her with the weapons with which to attack
                            Japanese fishing. On the question of the return of the Bonin islanders
                            the people viewed the United States attitude as a heartless one. This
                            unfavorable attitude on the part of the people could not help but exert
                            an influence on national policy and might result in the creation of a
                            great deal of grass roots anti-American feeling. The Japanese have a
                            saying that even a mountain can be undermined and crumble because of ant
                            holes. Mr. Miki said that the Japanese leaders would do their best to
                            cooperate, but that he hoped that the Secretary would also try to find
                            amicable solutions to some of these small problems.</p>
                        <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0198"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he appreciated Mr. Miki’s point of view and
                            agreed that our two countries must work closely in an effort to solve
                            problems such as this. At the same time, he added that he believed that
                            Japanese leaders themselves could do more to help in educating their
                            public to the basic principles involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that he wished to
                            raise one final point. He asked that the Secretary try to arrange for
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or some other international agency
                            to take up and discuss the problem of Japanese immigration. He hoped
                            that various nations of the world could be induced to accept Japanese
                            immigrants and assist in the relief of the problem of
                            overpopulation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed to look into the matter.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was concluded at approximately 12:00 noon.</p>

                                >Captain <persName>William C. Norvell</persName>.</note> that former
                            Bonin resident Arthur Ackerman (Asao Akaman) and family of six have been
                            authorized by US Navy to return to islands for permanent residence.
                            Ackermans, first returnees since initial post-war repatriates, will
                            travel from Yokosuka by naval vessel, leaving around April 10.</p>
                        <p>Story of Ackerman return has already received considerable attention
                            Japanese press. Stories note Ackermans “of American descent”; league of
                            former residents (Japanese) also reportedly at loss to understand why
                            Ackermans rather than others being permitted to return, since family
                            returned to live in Japan much earlier than others and left no land or
                            other property in Bonins. Foreign Office has informally raised subject,
                            indicated that “racial” factors make Ackerman repatriation hard to
                            explain.</p>
                        <p>Navy is apparently approving Ackerman repatriation because of (a)
                            American descent; (b) return requested by present residents (Embassy

                            absolutely no justification for this kind of discriminatory <pb n="171"
                                xml:id="pg_171" facs="0199"/>treatment, apparently based on Eurasian
                            background of Ackermans and wishes of present island inhabitants. Such
                            action obviously arouses resentment here, and makes our delicate
                            position on Bonin repatriation issue even more difficult to defend.

                                        <gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss>, that the prior approval

                                    of the naval commander in the Bonins, and that in view of
                                    recently received information, the Embassy believed that the
                                    Ackermans’ claim to repatriation was even more tenuous than
                                    previously indicated. “I wish to point out that Embassy was not
                                    consulted in advance on this decision [to repatriate the

                                stationed in Okinawa, together with elements of the 3rd Marine
                                Division which will assume the security mission in Okinawa. Army
                                forces in the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> after June 30,
                                1956 will thus number 95,000: 55,000 combat and combat support
                                troops and 40,000 service troops. Very little change is contemplated
                                for the Air Force and Navy in the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> and it is expected that the strength of each of the

                                about that level for some time.</item>

                            <item>The large number of service troops in Japan operate a vital
                                logistical base which supports all United States forces in Japan,
                                Okinawa and Korea as well as the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and
                                the 21 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions. This

                                lacks the vital industrial base and the tremendous depots existing
                                in Japan. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces do not have their own
                                logistical facilities, nor will they be provided under the Six-Year
                                Plan, and could only operate for about a week in an emergency
                                without the logistical base provided by United States forces.</item>

                                    Lemnitzer</persName> stressed his opinion that by June 30, 1956,
                                United States ground forces in Japan will be cut to an irreducible
                                minimum and no further reduction can be made in these forces until
                                it is decided to withdraw all United Stated armed forces from Japan.
                                Any further reduction of Army forces will require reducing the
                                support provided the other United States Services in the Far East
                                and making comparable reductions in the vital logistical base which
                                serves and supports many United States and other Free World Forces
                                in the Far East.</item>

                            <item>In his discussions of long-term United States base rights in
                                Japan, Mr. <persName>Parsons</persName> pointed out a number of
                                Japanese attitudes that must be taken into account: Unlike the
                                United Kingdom, for example, the Japanese people are not wholly
                                convinced that in any world crisis their basic interests are with
                                the United States; the Japanese are anxious to be independent—of the
                                United States and everybody else; the Japanese tend to look upon
                                present United States base rights as being solely for the defense of
                                Japan; they are disposed to equate the buildup of Japanese forces
                                with the reduction of United States forces; and the <pb n="173"

                                in Japanese eyes at least and despite their inadequacies, have been
                                developed with the idea that United States forces might be removed
                                after these goals are accomplished.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>The Japanese are not formally allied with the United States except
                                by the terms of the Security Treaty, which the Japanese consider to
                                be transitional in nature and a pact which they could not negotiate
                                with complete freedom at the time it was signed. The question of
                                long-term base rights seems to be completely unsettled and pressure
                                to force us out may build up. Under these circumstances, although
                                not a matter for immediate action, it is important to face two
                                problems: (1) What the long-term United States base requirements
                                are; and (2) by what strategy they can be secured.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>In an ensuing discussion, General Rogers agreed that the Embassy
                                and <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> should consult on this
                                matter and attempt to reach a course of future action. It was agreed
                                that the question of long-term base rights must be included in any
                                future mutual defense treaty negotiations to replace the present
                                Security Treaty. Mr. <persName>Parsons</persName> remarked that in
                                any discussions of this problem, the Embassy would like to
                                concentrate on the question of Japanese attitudes and steps that
                                might be taken to improve such attitudes.</item>

                                <persName>Dulles</persName> called attention to the efforts in South
                            Carolina and Alabama to discriminate against Japanese textiles. He
                            characterized this as violating our trade treaties and establishing a
                            dangerous trend toward individual State control of trade regulations—a
                            clearly unconstitutional activity. The President questioned what might
                            be done in addition to the case pending before the Supreme Court. Sec.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> noted his approach to a State Governor
                            in one instance and his receipt of an unsympathetic response.</p>

                        <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_BET1">Benson</persName> wondered if racial

                            believed not. Sec. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> noted
                            the fundamental need that every nation has for trading
                            opportunities.</p>

                            thought the situation aggravated by the unwise cotton policy of the past
                            whereby rigid supports had priced the South out of the international

                        <p>Sec. Mitchell suggested the matter be discussed at the forthcoming

                            pursued further through appropriate discussions prior to the Conference,
                            otherwise some State patriots might use the Conference as a forum.</p>

                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> expressed the
                                    feeling that the long list of exceptions showed indication of
                                    the impending disintegration of the multilateral controls
                                    system, particularly as it related to controls on trade with
                                    Communist China. In response to this statement, the President
                                    expressed great sympathy for the plight of Japan, which he felt
                                    was either obliged to trade with Communist China or ‘pass a tin
                                    cup around in San Francisco.’ Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1"
                                        >Dodge</persName> discussed this matter briefly, and
                                    expressed the opinion that the removal of controls on trade
                                    between Japan and Communist China would by no means provide a
                                    complete answer to Japan’s trade and economic problems. The
                                    President expressed agreement to the extent of stating that
                                    Japan’s problems had to be settled in bites, and not all at
                                    once.</p>
                                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> felt
                                    that there were two points which needed emphasis on trade
                                    between Japan and China. China had obvious need of certain
                                    manufactured articles produced in Japan. Japan in turn needed
                                    certain raw materials from China. Perhaps the two countries
                                    could get together and work it out; but from a psychological
                                    point of view, as long as the Japanese feel that the United
                                    States has them under wraps, they won’t like it. Perhaps the
                                    best thing was for us to allow the Japanese to make the effort
                                    to increase their trade with Communist China and see for
                                    themselves that this was not the real answer to all their

                        <p>The Secretary received the Japanese representatives at his home and heard
                            from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> the results of his
                            negotiations with the Soviets in Moscow<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2"
                                >Soviet-Japanese negotiations, which had been suspended after
                                September 13, 1955, resumed in London on January 17, only to be
                                broken off, at Soviet insistence, on March 20. On March 21, the
                                Soviet Union announced certain restrictions on Japanese salmon
                                fishing. In March and April 1956, the Department was preparing,
                                after consultation with the Japanese, to issue a statement
                                denouncing these restrictions as contrary to international law,
                                when, on April 9, the Soviets agreed to a Japanese request to
                                negotiate the salmon question. Japan then asked the United States
                                not to issue the statement, and the United States agreed. After
                                negotiations held in Moscow, at which Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> led the Japanese Delegation,
                                Japan and the Soviet Union signed on May 14 a sea rescue agreement
                                and an interim fisheries agreement, to take effect either
                                simultaneously with a peace treaty or when diplomatic relations
                                should be established. Also on May 14, the two countries announced
                                that negotiations on normalization of relations were to recommence
                                no later than July 31. Documentation is ibid., Central File
                                661.946.</note> and his impressions of the new political
                            relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union. The meeting lasted for
                            an hour and twenty minutes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that negotiating with
                            the Russians had been rather exhausting but that it had not been bad
                            while he was negotiating with the Minister of Fisheries, Ishkov.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">A.A. Ishkov.</note> Later, however, the head
                            of the Treaty Division and the head of the Far Eastern Division of the
                            Soviet Foreign Office entered the discussions and tried to deny to the
                            Japanese what Bulganin had promised them. The Soviet argument as put
                            forth by Premier Bulganin, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName>, was that Russia, which was defeated in 1905 by
                            Japan and again defeated by Germany in World War I, was determined to
                            reap the spoils of victory from World War II and Japan would have to
                            give up what it had taken in 1905. The Secretary interposed the remark
                            that the United States had had something to do with Soviet victory over
                            the Japanese in World War II and that the Soviets had in fact not
                            entered the war until the week in which the Japanese surrendered.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that his own
                            response to Bulganin’s blunt argument was that if this was the only
                            treatment which the Japanese were to receive, there was nothing to do
                            but go home; and it was at this point that Bulganin had agreed to an
                            interim fisheries arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> showed on a map where the
                            interim fisheries agreement area was and the abstention line of the
                            Tripartite Agreement,<note n="4" xml:id="d77fn4">Reference is to the

                            been drawn when the Tripartite Agreement was negotiated in Tokyo in
                            1951, on the assumption that it divided the eastern salmon stock from
                            the western salmon stock and it could be changed only after agreement
                            among the three parties following a 5-year trial. Last fall at the
                            Tripartite meeting at Tokyo, however, the Japanese had promised that
                            they would not increase <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0205"/>their
                            take this year near the line. Nevertheless, as a result of the Moscow
                            negotiations the Japanese felt compelled to move two groups from the
                            Okhotsk Sea to the zone east of Kamchatka. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that the American
                            fishermen might object if their salmon catch should be reduced as a
                            result of increased Japanese salmon catch to the westward of the line.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that he really was
                            not worried about the fisheries problem between the United States and
                            Japan because in any case Japan must reduce its catch compared with last
                            year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>, proceeding to the
                            political subject of Japanese-American relations in the light of the
                            developing relationships between Japan and the Soviet Union, asked for
                            the Secretary’s remarks. The Secretary said that while there was little
                            he could add to what he had said on this subject in Tokyo last March,
                            the United States intended to do everything possible to improve those
                            relations. While there were some problems, especially in the economic
                            field, and the exercise of tolerance was necessary, he saw no serious
                            obstacle to good relations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> stated that Bulganin had suggested the resumption
                            of Japanese-Soviet relations on the Adenauer formula<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d77fn5">Reference is to the decision taken in September 1955
                                by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union to resume
                                diplomatic relations without agreeing on territorial issues
                                outstanding between them and without signing a formal peace
                                treaty.</note> and that this course of action appeared inevitable to
                            the Japanese. However, it was his earnest wish to strengthen the
                            solidarity between Japan and the United States. The Secretary asked what
                            compensation or advantage Japan would get in return for the resumption
                            of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> named three advantages: the
                            repatriation of Japanese detainees, permission to fish in the northern
                            waters, and the Soviet pledge to support Japan’s entry into the United
                            Nations. The Secretary said that the USSR had made a token repatriation
                            of West German prisoners upon resuming relations with that state but
                            that repatriation had not been very successful thereafter. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> observed that the official Soviet
                            figure for West German detainees was 12,000 and that they had in fact
                            repatriated this number, although the West Germans claimed an additional
                            100,000. In the case of Japan, he said, the USSR admits holding 1200
                            detainees. The Japanese estimate of an additional 10,000 is inaccurate,
                            in <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>’s estimation. The
                            Secretary remarked that if the number of Japanese detainees was only
                            1200, there should be no great problem, and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> agreed to this saying that the
                            further detention of these people would be of no advantage to the
                            Soviets. With regard to entering the United Nations, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> status would be very important for Japan in that even
                            fisheries problems could be brought up there. The Secretary observed
                            that if the Japanese did not gain <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            entry now, they would have to pay a further <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178"
                                facs="0206"/>heavy price for that advantage. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that there would be no
                            exchange of ambassadors without Japanese entry into the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that there was some evidence that internal changes
                            in the Soviet Union indicate a greater degree of nationalism and a
                            lesser degree of emphasis upon international communism. If the Soviet
                            Union were to pursue its purely nationalistic goals, it was more
                            important than ever that the United States and Japan be closely allied
                            to prevent predominant Russian power in the western Pacific from
                            reducing Japan to a very subordinate position. The United
                            States-Japanese partnership was valuable and although the United States
                            had filled the role of senior partner as a result of the war, he hoped
                            that these roles could be reversed in the west Pacific. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that he also had observed
                            changes in in the Soviet Union and had gained the impression by the
                            actions of the people marching in Moscow on May Day that they had become
                            detached or removed somewhat from their leaders.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d77fn6">At the May 31 meeting of the National Security

                                reported to the Council on developments affecting U.S. security. The
                                section of the memorandum of discussion concerning Japan reads: “Mr.
                                    <persName>Dulles</persName> indicated that the negotiations
                                between Japan and the USSR were not making notable progress. It
                                appeared, however, that the Soviets were gradually wearing down the
                                Japanese in their opposition to a renewal of diplomatic relations in
                                the absence of a peace treaty. Hatoyama seems to favor what is

                                >Kono</persName>, opportunity for which United States Government
                            appreciated, United States officials did not express opposition to
                            resumption diplomatic relations or conclusion peace treaty on part Japan
                            because this regarded as matter for Japanese Government decision and
                            United States views on particular issues concerned with Japanese-Soviet
                            relations have previously been made known to Japanese Government.
                            However United States Government is concerned that Japan may accede to
                            resumption diplomatic relations USSR without obtaining adequate returns.
                            In this regard Department officials somewhat reassured by <persName

                            unfavorable reaction both in Okinawa and in Japan. In Okinawa, as we
                            understand the situation, the main basis for objections appears to be
                            the profound disinclination of the farmer to be separated from his land,
                            involving the loss of the yield of the land if under tillage and the
                            possible loss of title to the land itself. In Japan, on the other hand,
                            the basis for the adverse reaction seems to lie as well in a belief that
                            formal acquisition by the United States of large areas in Okinawa would
                            be inconsistent with residual Japanese sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State is impressed with the fairness and thoroughness
                            of the Price Subcommittee report and in general supports its
                            recommendations. However, it appears desirable to carry out the program
                            in such a manner as to allay the Ryukyuan and Japanese sentiments to the
                            fullest extent compatible with essential United States interests. The

                            acquisition of “leasehold or easement interests” where landowners are
                            unwilling to sell outright. This policy has not been publicly
                            stated.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State considers that it would be helpful if this policy
                            were publicly stated, and since willingness of a landholder to convey
                            the fee title would be most exceptional, that it would be advantageous
                            to make no distinction between condemnation and negotiation, and to
                            state simply that it is the policy of the United States to acquire
                            long-term right of use rather than the fee title. We think also that it
                            would be helpful in allaying opposition for the United States to clarify
                            the capacity in which it is prepared to acquire the long-term interests,
                            and to determine as a matter of policy and within the terms of the
                            Presidential Directive that such interests will be acquired and held in
                            the name of the Government of the Ryukyu Islands for the use <pb n="181"
                                xml:id="pg_181" facs="0209"/>of the United States, with the rights
                            and interests of the United States clearly spelled out and made a matter
                            of record so that no dispute could arise later on this point. It is
                            appreciated that this would probably require an ordinance of the U.S.
                            Civil Administration. The purpose of this course would not be to
                            represent the acquisition as a voluntary action of the local
                            authorities, however; it would be to present the acquisition for the use
                            of the United States in a manner most compatible with arrangements in
                            areas where the United States is not the sovereign.</p>
                        <p>There are many other aspects of the land program which it may be
                            desirable to clarify, although the Department of State realizes that
                            some of them will take time to elaborate. For instance, it would seem to
                            the Department of State, both as a matter of policy and of public
                            relations, that it would be desirable to develop the suggestion of the
                            Price Subcommittee that arrangements be made whereby the lump sum
                            payments to landowners could, with their consent and at their request,
                            be deposited in a fund which could be used under the management of the
                            Government of the Ryukyu Islands for development purposes in the area
                            and generate revenues which would give a reasonable return to the
                            investors.</p>
                        <p>It would seem highly desirable that a public statement be made as soon as
                            possible by the United States Government, clarifying its intentions with
                            respect to the land program to the fullest extent that that is possible.
                            It is suggested that such a statement be made by the Department of
                            Defense and that it cover the three points which are discussed above.
                            Officers of the Department of State are prepared to discuss these
                            questions in detail and to be of any possible assistance.<note n="4"

                                Japan</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>There has been an outburst in Japan of troublesome anti-American feeling
                            stemming from the Okinawan land problem. The furor began with the
                            publication on June 13 of the report of the Price Subcommittee of the
                            House Armed Services Committee recommending long-term United States
                            acquisition of land in Okinawa and lump sum payment therefor. It was
                            aggravated by sensational misrepresentations by the Japanese press
                            arising from a Congressional hearing on June 14, where a Defense
                            Department witness acknowledged that under Article IV of the the
                            Security Treaty it would be possible for the United States to keep bases
                            in Japan even for one hundred years. His statement was interpreted by
                            the Japanese press to mean that the United States would unilaterally
                            decide how long to keep its Japanese bases.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense will address itself to quieting public
                            sentiment in Okinawa. In your letter of June 22 to the Secretary of
                                Defense<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2"><ref target="#d79"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Supra.</hi></ref></note> you recommended that
                            he make a public statement which would clarify American intentions in
                            Okinawa. On June 22 the President sent a letter to Mr. Shuhei Higa,<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d80fn3">Not found.</note> Chief Executive of the

                            that he was asking Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> to communicate further with Mr. Higa on this

                        <p>It would appear to devolve upon State to meet the crisis that is brewing
                            in Japan. The Socialists in Japan are making capital both of the Price
                            Subcommittee report and of the misrepresentations of United States
                            intent to maintain bases one hundred years in Japan without consulting
                            Japanese desires. Their chief purpose, obviously, is to influence the
                            outcome of the Upper House elections, scheduled for July 8.<note n="4"

                            acknowledges officially for the first time our view of Japan’s residual
                            sovereignty in the Ryukyu Islands. The concept was first stated by you
                            when you were U.S. Delegate to the San Francisco Peace Conference, and
                            it appears in the Minutes of that conference but not in the Treaty. With
                            respect to our bases in Japan, the draft statement says nothing
                            specifically, but it does say that the Security Treaty with Japan unites
                            the Japanese and ourselves in maintaining international peace and
                            security in the Japan area, and in this enterprise we are working
                            together in our best mutual interests.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> extended a warm welcome
                            on behalf of himself, the Secretary and the Department of State to Mr.
                            Kuraishi and expressed his pleasure that Mr. Kuraishi was able to visit
                            the State Department on his current trip home from Geneva.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kuraishi stated that before his departure from Japan both the Prime
                            Minister and the Foreign Minister had requested him to stop in
                            Washington and to confer with the top United States officials for the
                            specific purpose of clearing away any possible misunderstanding in the
                            United States regarding the policy of the Japanese Government toward the
                            United States. He stated that there have been reports in the press in
                            Japan that many American officials have concluded that Japan may soon
                            make an easy political accommodation with the USSR in the interest of
                            early normalization of relations between Japan and the USSR. He
                            understood that the same type of reports had been appearing in
                            newspapers in the United States. Such reports are garbled and reflect a
                            clear misunderstanding of Japan’s policy on this question; there in no
                            intention on the part of the Japanese Government to follow such an easy
                            line when negotiations on the peace treaty are reopened.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> assured Mr. Kuraishi
                            that there is no question in our minds about the intentions of the
                            Japanese Government. We understand that the press does sometimes have
                            reports that do not reflect the true policy of the Government. This also
                            happens in the United States. He added that the Secretary had told him
                            about his excellent conversations with the Prime Minister, the Foreign
                            Minister and other Japanese officials in Japan during his visit there in
                            March.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kuraishi said that with respect to Red China there are segments of
                            the Japanese public and political groups in Japan who advocate closer
                            relations. In particular, these groups are pushing for increased trade
                            with Red China. However, it is the firm intention of the Japanese
                            Government not to act unilaterally in relation to these matters. The
                            Government will consult fully and will act in concert with the United
                            States. This assurance Mr. Kuraishi was extending at the specific
                            request of both the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> expressed appreciation
                            for Mr. Kuraishi’s extension of these assurances. He added that
                            particularly with respect to Red China the American public has very deep
                            feelings. Accordingly, Japanese actions in relation to Red China, if not
                            well coordinated with the United States, could be misunderstood and lead
                            to difficulties in relations between Japan and the United States. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> added that he believed
                            the Secretary had pointed out in his discussion with Japanese officials
                            that the Japanese Government would be wise to make sure <pb n="185"
                                xml:id="pg_185" facs="0213"/>that the advantages which it desired in
                            any possible relations with the USSR were securely “nailed down” before
                            the Japanese Government agreed to the Soviet’s wishes.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName>, regarding his travel plans, Mr. Kuraishi stated
                            that he had received a telephone call from Tokyo on June 5 requesting
                            his return with the utmost dispatch. Accordingly, he is returning to
                            Japan by way of the Pacific as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kuraishi stated that the development of the United States air bases
                            in Japan is not proceeding as rapidly as desired by both the Japanese
                            and the United States Governments. Mr. Kuraishi has responsibilities in
                            connection with expediting these developments, and he will exert his
                            efforts to move the matter ahead as quickly as possible. There is, of
                            course, some resistance in Japan, particularly on the part of the
                            Socialists; however, the vast majority of the people in Japan are in
                            favor of moving ahead. Recently the Government has established a Defense
                            Council, whose members are Mr. Kuraishi, the Chief of the Defense
                            Agency, and the Ministers of Finance and Construction. This group, too,
                            will bend its efforts to expedite the defense buildup in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> appreciated both Mr.
                            Kuraishi’s explanation and the difficulties which the Japanese face in
                            this particular situation. He explained that we regard the development
                            of the defense of Japan in the context of mutual security and are giving
                            every possible consideration, in conjunction with the Department of
                            Defense, to its development in ways which will minimize the
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kuraishi asked for a sympathetic understanding by the United States
                            of the confused political situation in Japan. He explained that the
                            Socialist Party is unpredictable. He added that unlike the Labor Party
                            in Great Britain, who would undoubtedly continue close association with
                            the United States should they be returned to a position of leadership,
                            there is no guarantee that the Socialists in Japan will not move away
                            from the free world should they at some future date obtain control of
                            the government in Japan. Of course, not all members of the Socialist
                            Party take this position. Some of the more conservative members would
                            clearly desire to continue Japan’s orientation to the free world. In
                            addition to the Socialists, some Labor leaders desire to move away from
                            Japan’s orientation toward the free world. Although the vast majority of
                            the Japanese people desire close alignment with the United States and
                            other free nations, these small elements among the Socialist and Labor
                            groups becloud the situation and add confusion on the Japanese
                            scene.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> stated that with
                            respect to the defense of Japan he would like to add that the United
                            States is moving as fast as possible to reduce United States forces in
                            Japan. In this situation, however, we are <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186"
                                facs="0214"/>guided heavily by Japan’s own desires in relation to
                            the augmentation of her defense forces. Since these matters are closely
                            related, we do not want to create difficulties by our own actions and
                            are most anxious to have any suggestions which the Government of Japan
                            could give us on the matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kuraishi explained that one of the prime objectives of the present
                            Japanese Government is to create increased stability, both political and
                            economic, in Japan. Such increased stability will permit an increased
                            understanding on the part of the Japanese public of Japan’s need for
                            continued close relations with Western nations, particularly the United
                            States. To further this end, the Government has sought and obtained
                            legislative authority to establish a Defense Council and a Constitution
                            Revision Committee. They have also obtained legislative authority to
                            reform the school board system. In addition, the Government attempted to
                            reform the electoral system by establishing smaller electoral districts.
                            However, they were unable to obtain passage of this measure in the last
                            Diet session. As Labor Minister, Mr. Kuraishi is bending his efforts to
                            help achieve the objectives of the Government by improving the housing
                            conditions for laborers, taking other actions which will increase the
                            stability among the working population in Japan, and although his plans
                            are not yet fully developed, he is thinking of other actions and may, he
                            said, need to come to the United States for help in implementing some of
                            these plans. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> assured
                            Mr. Kuraishi that the United States Government will do what it can to be
                            of help in this situation, and we will certainly watch the developments
                            with great interest. He added that the type of economic system which we
                            have in the United States and which is also prevalent in Japan certainly
                            provides the best basis for handling the types of problems which Mr.
                            Kuraishi referred to. Our own economic system has brought great strength
                            to the United States. We are certain that the Conservative Party in
                            Japan and the Minister of Labor agree that this type of system will
                            solve Japan’s economic and political problems much more quickly and more
                            successfully than those plans which the more radical elements would
                            adopt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> referred to the current
                            problem in the United States resulting from textile imports from Japan.
                            He assured Mr. Kuraishi that the Executive Branch is bending every
                            effort to prevent the establishment of quotas or other types of
                            legislation which would freeze imports from Japan at an undesirably low
                            level. In this connection, the Government is very appreciative of the
                            restraint which the Government of Japan has demonstrated in handling the
                            problem of exports from Japan. He added that a continuation of this
                            policy of restraint should be helpful to the efforts of the Executive
                            Branch in connection with the question of imports from Japan. At this
                            juncture, we are hopeful that legislation which would arbitrarily
                            restrict imports from <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0215"/>Japan
                            will not be passed, but we can not be certain on the question.<note

                                to the then-pending Mutual Security bill which would have imposed

                            year and Americans take politics very seriously. Over and above this, as
                            far as textiles are concerned, the United States industry has recently
                            moved to the south, and now for the first time in history there is
                            developing a protectionist sentiment among representatives of the
                            south.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kuraishi indicated that there have been statements in the Japanese
                            press which indicate that some Americans think the United States can not
                            be sure of the direction in which Japan will move in its relations
                            toward the United States on the one hand and the USSR and Communist
                            China on the other. Consequently, according to these reports, little
                            effort should be given in the United States to help Japan in the current
                            textile situation. He added that there can be no doubt about Japan’s
                            future course in relation to its orientation toward the free world, and
                            he hoped that this misunderstanding among the American public would not
                            deter the United States Government from making decisions that will be
                            helpful in connection with Japan’s textile export situation.</p>

                                    Report (identical to the June 27 version) as follows:</p><p>“The

                                        >NSC</gloss> 5516/1) is adequate. However, the report also
                                    states that while Japan is still basically aligned with the
                                    United States, some of the ties are wearing thin, and
                                    developments over recent months tend to introduce a new phase in
                                    U.S.-Japanese relations. Improved political stability, a
                                    comfortable foreign exchange situation, resurgence of
                                    nationalism and a drift towards the Communist continent are
                                    important signs of decreased Japanese dependence on the United
                                    States and the advent of more independent Japanese policies.
                                    Troublesome problems to which the report draws attention are the
                                    Bonin Islanders, war criminals, territorial issues, the tendency
                                    to establish new relations with the USSR and Communist China,
                                    Pacific fisheries, security arrangements, Japanese trade, and
                                    Asian economic development.</p>

                                    the initial draft of this report, the Japanese have approached

                            indicated that, thanks to the number of Socialists elected, it would be
                            practically impossible for the Japanese Government to obtain the
                            two-thirds vote in the House necessary to secure the desired program of
                            Japanese rearmament. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> also noted the
                            possibility of an early resumption of negotiations between Japan and the
                            USSR for a treaty of peace.</p>
                        <p>Apropos of the situation in Japan, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> informed the Council that the Defense Department
                            had agreed upon a new plan for the reorganization of military affairs in
                            the Pacific area. When this plan was in effect there would be a single
                            Pacific Command headed up by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1"
                                >Stump</persName>. In addition, it had been decided to remove the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command from Japan and to locate
                            it in Korea. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            said this was part of the great effort in the Defense Department to
                            scotch <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0217"/>the idea so prevalent in
                            Japan that that country was still occupied. If we could not succeed in
                            destroying this idea, we stood to lose our entire position in the
                            Japanese islands. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> warned that it might take a year to effect this
                            reorganization, although he was not sure that it need take more than
                            three months.<note n="4" xml:id="d82fn4">The reorganization was effected
                                on July 1, 1957.</note></p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> expressed great
                            satisfaction at this information from Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, and said that the only
                            disturbing aspect was the length of time estimated to be required to
                            effect this reorganization.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> replied by
                            reemphasizing that the reorganization could be done much more quickly if
                            it was necessary, and he would be very glad to have Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s recommendation for a shorter
                            period. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> said he
                            would be very glad to see the reorganization accomplished in thirty
                            days, and promised the help of the State Department in effecting the
                            relocation of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command to

                                >MDAP</gloss> activities, or, in some way, reflect on State.”<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">This statement is not recorded in the
                                memorandum of the July 12 meeting.</note> In my opinion, the
                            slowness in the Japanese defense buildup results from basic political
                            and economic attitudes of the Japanese and has no direct relation to the
                            manner in which the <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> has been
                            administered. The principal matter pertaining to the Japanese defense
                            buildup in which the Department of State has been involved is the
                            agreement with the Japanese Government on a formula for the progressive
                            reduction of the Japanese contribution to the support of U.S. forces in
                            Japan, which was reached in January 1956. This, it is believed, is a
                            material contribution to the buildup of Japanese forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> may have referred
                            to the slowness in <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> deliveries. The
                                <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> program for FY 1955–56 for
                            equipment and supplies to the Japanese amounted to $252,315,000. As of
                            February 29, 1956, deliveries of only $54,730,000 had been accomplished
                            under this program. A possible explanation of the apparent slowness in
                            deliveries may be the global reprogramming in the early part of 1956
                            which resulted in “new money” for Japan. The Department of Defense has
                            primary responsibility for developing <gloss target="#t_MDAP1"
                                >MDAP</gloss> programming; the Department of State’s function is
                            limited to concurrence in programs.<note n="4" xml:id="d83fn4">An

                            request last night in company with <persName corresp="#p_MTF1">Frank
                                Matsumoto</persName> to give me his views on situation in Japan
                            after elections. He specifically asked what he told me be passed on to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> for he said it
                            is most important that close and intimate relations be maintained by
                            United States and Japan and that United States leaders be kept
                            accurately informed of internal situation here. After pointing out
                            manner in which Liberal-Democratic Party leadership <pb n="191"
                                xml:id="pg_191" facs="0219"/>failed in past election through their

                            frankness he wished to point out that action of United States
                            authorities in issuing Price Report on Okinawa and making public
                            congressional hearings on military assistance programs and desire of
                            United States to see constitutional change in Japan had played
                            significant role in assisting Socialists increase their strength. He did
                            not dwell on this at length however as he said there is no use crying
                            over spilled milk and he seemed to feel important thing was what was
                            done in future.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> outlined plans of party
                            leadership over next month or two as follows: There is agreement
                            Hatoyama should retire but only if suitable replacement can be found.
                            Month of August will be devoted by party leadership to attempt to reach
                            agreement on who successor should be. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> said he and “so-called” mainline of party favored
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> as successor but
                            unfortunately there is in some quarters considerable opposition and it
                            might take some time to achieve their end. There is even more opposition
                            to <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> who has been
                            mentioned also as possible successor.</p>
                        <p>Around end of month or during early part September there will be major
                            Cabinet re-shuffle. At this time <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> would leave Cabinet and take <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s post as party Secretary General.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> would enter Cabinet
                            although not decided in just what capacity. Apparently this Cabinet
                            change will take place whether or not agreement has been reached on
                            successor to Hatoyama. If successor has been picked by party leaders it
                            will be necessary to call Diet into session in order to have new Prime
                            Minister elected. It was not clear whether or not this would be done as
                            soon as agreement on successor had been reached or whether Cabinet
                            change would be first step with Hatoyama remaining in office for short
                            time until normal session of Diet is convened in November. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> believes putting <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> in Cabinet will increase his
                            chances become Prime Minister if August deliberations failed to agree on
                            successor. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> states next big
                            public test for Conservatives will be Lower House elections which he
                            anticipates will take place next spring. He is confident that
                            Conservatives can win these elections and obtain ⅔ majority. One of
                            reasons for failure in Upper House elections was abstention of many
                            Conservatives from voting and <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>
                            says this has been good lesson to party which will see to it that in
                            future this does not happen. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>
                            at this point smiled and said, “Of course I assume there will be no more
                            Washington help for Socialists”.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Soviet-Japanese negotiations <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_SM1"

                            presumably referring to his statement to Secretary that if diplomatic
                            relations with Soviets resumed it would be necessary for Japanese
                            Government to take firmer stand against Communists in Japan and to

                            interest by American Government in Japan and its problems. This

                        <p>This despatch is responsive to paragraph 4 of the referenced
                                Circular.<note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">In paragraph 4 of circular 12,

                                implications of the programs as submitted by the MAAGs.</note></p>
                        <p>As was the case in the 1957 Military Assistance Program, the 1958 program
                            provides, in accordance with the instructions contained in the
                            Department of Defense (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>) Program
                            Guidance, an accurate assessment of the matériel which would be needed
                            to meet the defense objectives for Japanese Fiscal Year 1957. Also, it
                            is clear from our review of the program that a conscientious effort has
                            been made to screen from the program those items which the Japanese
                            Government is willing to supply, and able to supply within time limits
                            set by the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>While it is thus felt that the 1958 program is fully consistent with
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> programming guidance, it is
                            nonetheless clear that Japan is financially and physically able to bear
                            a much larger share of anticipated defense costs. This situation, and an
                            estimate of the extent to which Japan can be expected to increase its
                            defense effort, are discussed in Embassy Despatch No. 100 dated August
                            3, 1956.<note n="5" xml:id="d85fn5">Not printed. (Department of State,

                        <p>Apart from the domestic political difficulties discussed in that
                            despatch, there is no real incentive for Japan to take on a greater
                            share of its own defense costs as long as the United States continues
                            its present policy of disposing of less up-to-date equipment of U.S.
                            Forces through the device of the Military Assistance Program. The
                            Japanese are well aware of the reason why they are supplied with this
                            equipment, and they expect the supply to be practically inexhaustible.
                            Thus <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0222"/>the Six-Year Plan, which
                            is the present although unofficial basis for defense planning by the
                            Japanese, is predicated on the assumption of continued massive U.S. end
                            item assistance.</p>
                        <p>An important consideration to bear in mind when attempting to appraise
                            Japan’s defense effort is the fact that the Japanese may not be
                            convinced that the U.S. program for building up Japan’s defense forces
                            is realistic. It is difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate accurately
                            Japan’s thinking on this question. Certainly, however, some or all of
                            the following considerations have occurred to the Japanese. These
                            considerations represent a source of great confusion which mitigate
                            against development of and implementation of a realistic Japanese plan
                            for self defense.</p>

                            <item>The Japanese have never accepted U.S. ideas on the defense of
                                Japan which originally provided for <hi rend="italic">major</hi>
                                emphasis on ground forces with <hi rend="italic">major</hi> air and
                                navy support to be provided by the United States. U.S. planning has
                                shifted somewhat from this early stand, but even for <gloss
                                    target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1957 almost half of the Japanese
                                defense budget for ground forces, most of which is required to
                                provide the manpower to use ground force matériel supplied by the
                                United States. The Japanese doubtless fear that Japan will not be
                                defended on the beaches, and therefore the expenditure of nearly
                                half of their defense agency budget on ground forces probably does
                                not appeal to their estimate of sound relative priorities between
                                the services.</item>

                            <item>Recent statements emanating from Washington tend to confirm the
                                view that ground forces are becoming less important not only for
                                Japan but for the United States as well. The idea of shifting to a
                                greater dependence on modern weapons has received a tremendous
                                amount of publicity, and the implications of this shift are not lost
                                on the Japanese. The United States appears to the Japanese to have
                                revised its own defense planning but still to be urging Japanese
                                adherence to U.S. Force goals, which were determined five years or
                                more ago, and which provide for what the Japanese no doubt think is
                                an excessive emphasis on ground forces.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>On numerous occasions the U.S. has emphasized that U.S. armed
                                forces support would be withdrawn as Japan’s military strength
                                increases. Usually, however, redeployment of U.S. forces for Japan
                                has been undertaken for reasons quite unrelated to the direct
                                defense of Japan, although the U.S. has insisted that the role of
                                the U.S. in the defense of Japan has not been affected thereby. The
                                end result of these troop movements is that U.S. combat forces
                                contributing directly to Japan’s defense have been decreasing faster
                                than Japan’s own forces have been increasing. From the Japanese
                                standpoint this is not a realistic approach towards solution of the
                                joint problem of defending Japan <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195"
                                    facs="0223"/>or of the implementation of plans therefor. Under
                                these circumstances the Japanese would not know how to plan even if
                                they were willing significantly to increase their support of their
                                own forces.</item>

                            suggested that the review proceed along the following lines: <list>

                                    military equipment. If the old procedures are to be followed
                                    (and the Embassy recognizes that there are many advantages in
                                    such programs), no special effort should be made to induce an
                                    increased effort on the part of the Japanese to produce similar
                                    weapons.</item>

                                <item>Before making any such attempt, however, it is suggested that
                                    a complete review of Japanese force goals be undertaken <hi

                                    believe that a reappraisal of Japan’s defense requirements, if
                                    undertaken in conjunction with the Japanese, might lead to a
                                    de-emphasis of ground forces. It is possible that the Japanese
                                    would agree to an increase in <hi rend="italic">total</hi>
                                    defense expenditures if the United States would agree to a
                                    reduction of ground force goals. The Japanese are now meeting
                                    U.S. objectives for air forces, including naval air forces, and
                                    are very close to U.S. objectives for surface naval forces.
                                    Moreover, for these forces Japan is supplying a large and
                                    increasing part of the required hardware. If the ground force
                                    goals were thought to be more realistic, the Japanese Government
                                    might be willing and able to pass a larger defense budget even
                                    over inevitable Socialist opposition. If such an effort were
                                    successful, the volume of U.S. end item support to Japan’s
                                    defense forces could be reduced.</item>

                                <item>Finally, it is suggested that the United States is not taking
                                    full advantage of the potential leverage which would be
                                    available for the furtherance of U.S. military objectives in
                                    Japan if our programming procedures were more flexible. After
                                    more than five years of large-scale U.S. support, it is not
                                    surprising that the Six-Year Plan is predicated on the
                                    assumption of a continuation of such support.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>As indicated in the initial paragraph of this despatch, it is felt that
                            the MAAG program for 1958 is entirely consistent with <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> programming guidance. Therefore the
                            Embassy and the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> have little to
                            offer by way of comments on details of the program. The MAAG report
                            points with justifiable pride to the successful joint program for the
                            production of T–33 and F–86 aircraft in Japan. In the Navy section of
                            the report, reference is made to unsuccessful efforts to develop a
                            similar joint program for the production of naval aircraft in Japan.
                            These efforts have been observed closely and it is believed that the <pb
                                n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0224"/>prospects for a Naval aircraft
                            production program remain good despite the fact that the Defense Agency
                            rejected the recent offer by the U.S. side. The essence of the Japanese
                            position is that the U.S.-proposed joint program for the production of
                            naval aircraft fails to provide reasonable assurance of continued U.S.
                            support of the program. Indications are that the Japanese Government,
                            subject of course to the availability of funds in future years, might
                            support a Five-Year joint program. They expect the same kind of U.S.
                            support, that is, a declaration of a U.S. policy, subject to the
                            availability of funds during the program period. It is also believed
                            that serious and prompt consideration should be given to the possibility
                            of a joint program for the production of the Nike in Japan. Indications
                            are that sample quantities of various guided missiles will be made
                            available to Japan in the near future for research purposes, and the
                            MAAG program for 1958 proposes to re-equip four <gloss target="#t_AAA1"
                                >AAA</gloss> battalions with the Nike at a cost of $72,000,000 to
                            the U.S. It is altogether possible that the Japanese would welcome a
                            joint production program as well as a joint research and development
                            program. All of the arguments in favor of F–86 production in Japan would
                            seem to apply, with greater force.</p>
                        <p>In commenting on the MAAG Program for <gloss target="#t_USFY1"
                                >USFY</gloss> 1957, the Embassy and the <gloss target="#t_USOM1"
                                >USOM</gloss> opposed a proposal to supply the Japanese with large
                            quantities of ammunition. It is noted that the 1958 program contains no
                            such proposals and that the quantities called for are relatively modest
                            and of low priority. In most cases it would appear that the quantities
                            which the U.S. would furnish are not sufficiently large to justify
                            economical production in Japan. The alternative to inclusion of these
                            quantities in the MAAG program would be their purchase by the Japanese
                            from sources outside Japan. It is felt that the Japanese would not
                            provide budgetary support for such purchase.</p>
                        <p>As directed in the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> programming
                            guidance, the MAAG has given very careful consideration to the subject
                            of spare parts. The Embassy and the <gloss target="#t_USOM1"
                                >USOM</gloss> feel that the MAAG has successfully carried out the
                            spirit of these instructions. Spare parts for the ground forces are
                            almost entirely in priority category II, and it is only with reference
                            to aircraft spare parts that a significant allocation of funds is called
                            for in the 1958 program. There can be no question that the Japanese are
                            making a reasonable effort to supply aircraft parts. The fact that most
                            of these parts will go into aircraft being produced in Japan during the
                            next several years is a necessary development. It is reasonable to
                            assume that Japan will assume support of its own aircraft as rapidly as
                            possible.</p>

                            been an increase in concern about the United States administration of
                            the Ryukyus in Japanese circles. As Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> has pointed out in a series of
                            messages which have been transmitted to the Department of Defense, our
                            policies in the Ryukyus have clearly to be considered not only from the
                            standpoint of sound local administration in the Ryukyus but also from
                            the standpoint of our long-term relations with Japan. At the same time
                            it appears that although the agitation within the Ryukyus on the land
                            issue has somewhat subsided there remain basic underlying
                            dissatisfactions that may rise to plague us again on other issues in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>I therefore request that our two departments consider together, before
                            new decisions are taken or any existing decisions are executed, the
                            policies to be applied in the following matters: <list>

                                    forces. On this point the Department of State is now of opinion
                                    that the acquisition of long-term interest by lump sum payments
                                    should proceed most cautiously, and that until a procedure is
                                    devised which is basically acceptable to the Ryukyuan population
                                    and not susceptible to serious criticism in Japan, it would be
                                    preferable to continue to occupy the lands without any fixed
                                    term and on the payment of an annual rental. If the introduction
                                    of new methods should be delayed, it may be desirable to
                                    reexamine again the amount of the annual rentals.</item>

                                    opinion that any plans calling for the withdrawal of further

                                    political implications because of the interpretation which might
                                    be placed upon a separation of the Ryukyus from Japan in the
                                    United States command structure. At the same time the Department
                                    of State suggests that serious consideration be given to
                                    establishing direct communications on matters of civil
                                    administration between the administrative authorities in the

                                    from Washington on civil matters should be regarded as a <pb

                                    appears desirable to establish some more formal mechanism for

                        <p>I do not suggest that these matters must all be resolved together or at
                            the same time, and the Department of State will be glad to consider them
                            through whatever procedure the Department of Defense regards as most
                            fitting. With respect to timing, we would think it desirable, in view of
                            the speculation which is bound to occur, that a decision on the third
                            point be announced promptly. We are also inclined to think that it would
                            be helpful if a statement of United States Government policy on the land
                            problem could be made indicating that no solution will be pushed through
                            hastily. Officers of the Department are discussing such a statement with
                            officers of the Department of Defense.</p>

                            is about best we can do under present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>We should continue to resist notion that our actions on Okinawa should
                            reflect intention remaining there permanently. In the first place, we
                            have given explicit public assurances that we shall be there only so
                            long as conditions of threat and tension continue. By acting as if we
                            were in Okinawa permanently, we do not get rid of Japanese pressure for
                            return of administrative control but in fact increase it. I think our
                            telegrams have made clear that Embassy expects such pressure to increase
                            over next few years and it will be easier to handle if the target is not
                            so precisely outlined as would be the case if our actions are manifestly
                            taken in expectation of remaining permanently in Okinawa. Moreover, as
                            suggested mytel 56,<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">Dated July 10, not
                                printed. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                711.56394C/7–1056)</note> it is far from certain that on broad
                            strategic grounds we want to be there permanently. In this connection
                            during his recent visit here Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> told me that while he was <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> he had never been consulted on
                            build-up Okinawa. He doubted wisdom of decision make Okinawa main base
                                <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0229"/>but believed it should have
                            been developed as staging area for Air Force with main base being
                            somewhere in trust territory such as Saipan. I would urge again high
                            level reconsideration of basic US objectives in Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>Embassy remains of belief that, in acquiring land, lease for 20 or 25
                            years would be ample for all US purposes, but if decision to adhere to
                            lump sum principle for long tenure is unavoidable, emphatically agree
                            with Department that fee title should not be acquired even if owners are
                            willing to concede it. Embassy [garble] concurs Department view that
                            easement should be for indefinite term rather than for fixed long term
                            such as 50 or 99 years.</p>
                        <p>Embassy concurs with Department view on interest being vested in <gloss
                                target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss> as conforming to practice elsewhere, as
                            consistent with fundamental legal theory that Okinawa is not American
                            soil, and as making program more acceptable to Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Concur that any public statements should be made by <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> here or in Okinawa,
                            but think that time has passed when generalized public statement of any
                            kind would be useful, particularly one which in effect reaffirms lump
                            sum payment, fails to give more categoric assurances on new acquisitions
                            than have previously been made, and fails to spell out in detail
                            constructive features of entire land acquisition and resettlement
                            program. Recommend instead that Defense authorize <persName

                                    resumed at Moscow on July 31, but were suspended on August 13 in

                                    Conference. By that time, however, the talks had reached
                                    deadlock over the territorial issue and over a Soviet proposal
                                    that warships of nonriparian powers be excluded from the Japan
                                    Sea. At a press conference held in Moscow on August 13,
                                        <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> expressed
                                    the belief that it was advisable to conclude a treaty even on
                                    the Soviet terms.</p>
                                <p>In telegram 366 from Tokyo, August 14, <persName
                                        corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> reported that he had
                                    learned from a Japanese source that the remainder of the Cabinet
                                    was unanimous in opposing a treaty on the Soviet terms. (<hi
                                        rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files,
                                661.941/8–1456)</p></note> He said the only remaining point at issue
                            was the territorial question. The Soviet Union wished to draw a boundary
                            line to the north of Habomai and Shikotan. He inquired whether such a
                            boundary would be legal from the point of view of the San Francisco
                            Treaty. He said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJ1">Sebald</persName>
                            had stated to the Japanese Embassy in Washington that such a concession
                            would be in contravention of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reminded Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> that the Kuriles and Ryukyus were handled in
                            the same manner under the surrender terms and that while the United
                            States had by the peace treaty agreed that residual sovereignty to the
                            Ryukyus might remain with Japan, we had also stipulated by Article 26
                            that if Japan gave better terms to Russia we could demand the same terms
                            for ourselves. That would mean that if Japan recognized that the Soviet
                            Union was entitled to full sovereignty over the Kuriles we would assume
                            that we were equally entitled to full sovereignty over the Ryukyus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> stated his
                            understanding that under Article 3 the status of these islands was
                            definitively settled and could not be reopened. The Secretary again
                            reaffirmed that this was not the case because of Article 26.</p>
                        <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0231"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> inquired whether the
                            United States would be prepared to take the initiative to convene a
                            conference to discuss the disposition of the Kuriles and the Ryukyus.
                            The Secretary took a negative attitude to this suggestion. He noted that
                            Article 27 should be of value to Japan in its negotiations with the
                            Soviet Union. The Japanese might tell the Soviets that if they were
                            forced to give up the Kuriles they would have to give up the Ryukyus as
                            well. In its dealings with Japan the United States has been soft where
                            the Soviet Union has been tough. Perhaps the United States should
                            likewise get tough. The Secretary expressed the opinion that the Soviet
                            Union needs peace with Japan as much as Japan needs peace with the
                            Soviet Union. He recalled that the Soviet Union had taken the position
                            repeatedly that they would never have a peace treaty with Austria until
                            peace had been made with Germany, but they had suddenly changed. Perhaps
                            in dealing with the Soviet Union the best way would be to take the
                            position that all the Kuriles enjoy the same status as the Ryukyus—i.e.,
                            foreign occupation with residual sovereignty resting with Japan. He
                            thought there might be a basis for compromise with the Soviet Union
                            taking sovereignty over certain islands and conceding Japan sovereignty
                            over others. He said that he did not see the Japanese query about the
                            San Francisco Treaty until he was about to leave Washington. He told the
                            Japanese Ambassador there in effect what he was now telling Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d89fn4">No other record of this conversation has been
                                found.</note> If Japan tells the Soviet Union that it could have
                            sovereignty over the Kuriles, then the United States will insist on
                            sovereignty over the Ryukyus. The Secretary remarked in parentheses that
                            he did not necessarily mean that the United States would in fact insist
                            on full sovereignty over the Ryukyus but rather that the United States
                            was entitled to do so and he could not guarantee what some future United
                            States Government might say with regard to this problem. The whole
                            purpose of Article 26 is to prevent a subsequent Treaty from extracting
                            from Japan more favorable conditions. Were Japan to ask the United
                            States if the title to the Kuriles could be split as between the
                            southern-northern parts, the United States might reconsider. The United
                            States has already turned back the northern Ryukyus. The Secretary
                            suggested Japan might tell the Soviet Union of the tough line the United
                            States was taking—that if the Soviet Union were to take all the Kuriles,
                            the United States might remain forever in Okinawa, and no Japanese
                            Government could survive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said that, if the
                            United States were firm in its interpretation as outlined by the
                            Secretary, Japan should then renew its efforts with the Soviet Union.
                            The Japanese argument was the Kunashiri and Etorofu were properly the
                            territory of Japan and that Japanese sovereignty over these islands had
                            never before been questioned <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0232"/>by
                            the Soviet Union. The Soviet reply had been that the disposition of
                            these islands had been decided by wartime agreements with the United
                            States and the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated emphatically that this was untrue. He said that the
                            wartime decisions were only recommendations for consideration at a Peace
                            Treaty. He could assure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> that no statement of President Truman ever
                            confirmed Soviet title to these islands and that he would confirm this
                            position if the Japanese formally ask him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> suggested that the
                            United Kingdom might have a different view as to the validity of the
                            wartime declarations. The Secretary replied that he could not speak for
                            the United Kingdom and that he never discussed this point with the
                            United Kingdom. It is possible that, by virtue of the British
                            constitutional system, the Prime Minister had bound the United Kingdom
                            at Yalta.<note n="5" xml:id="d89fn5"><gloss target="#t_Secto1"

                                August 20, the Department, after mentioning several alternatives,
                                concluded that “at this point” it would be “on balance” best to
                                offer no advice to Japan on the territorial issue. (Department of

                            He several times referred vaguely to desirability US calling conference
                            of Japan, USSR, UK, perhaps others to consider question final
                            territorial dispositions. It would presumably be predicated upon
                            residual and inchoate right of victors to dispose finally of territories
                            over which Japan had renounced sovereignty but where no new sovereignty
                            internationally agreed upon. Apparently <persName corresp="#p_SM1"

                        <p>Embassy Tokyo looking at the next year or two anticipates continuation of
                            conservative factionalism and the falling away of disgruntled
                            individuals from the conservative party, but regards a complete split in
                            the conservatives as improbable. However, as a result of their losses to
                            the Socialists in the recent Upper House election the conservatives—and
                            the Government—are expected to pay greater attention to measures having
                            popular appeal, such as the Okinawan land problem and to shelve less
                            popular measures. The replacement of Hatoyama, however, should bring
                            more capable and energetic leadership. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> is regarded as the most probable successor to
                            Hatoyama. However, <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> is trying
                            to postpone the Hatoyama succession until spring, though favoring a
                            cabinet reshuffle before the next Diet session this fall.</p>

                        <p>There is no “automatic trend” in favor of the Socialist Party and at
                            present no prospect of extreme left or right gaining greatly in
                            strength. The socialists are not likely to gain except in the event of
                            conservative deterioration through disunity and incompetence but the
                            indirect influence of the socialists on conservative policy will be
                            considerable, i.e., Conservatives will be impelled to say and do things
                            considered popular. The balance of probability lies in the direction of
                            continued though somewhat halting evolution of moderate conservatism in
                            Japan but the margin between Conservative program and Conservative
                            deterioration is probably not great and therefore international
                            influences though marginal can add up to “just that critical difference”
                            between meager success and failure. This point was graphically
                            illustrated when “ill advised and ill timed United States Government
                            action strengthened the Socialists.”</p>
                        <p>On the international scene the next five years will probably be marked by
                            the completion of Japan’s reentry into the world by joining the United
                            Nations, settling reparations, establishing diplomatic relations with
                            USSR and its major satellites and probably official relations “short of
                            diplomatic status” with Red China. Japan’s growing economic independence
                            from the United States is likely to increase and Japan’s military
                            dependence on the United States is likely to weaken further, so that
                            “Japan can less and less be taken for granted.” Japan five years hence
                            can have one of four possible postures toward other nations, and which
                            one it is will depend much upon what the United States does and says: 1.
                            voluntary alignment with United States; 2. alignment with a neutral
                            Asian-African bloc; 3. a pragmatically independent role basically
                            pro-Japanese and 4. alignment with the Communist orbit, particularly Red
                            China. There is much to persuade Japan to follow the third course but
                            most Japanese Conservatives believe <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207"
                                facs="0235"/>Japan’s interest can be best served by developing an
                            enduring partnership with the United States. Alignment with the
                            Communist orbit is unlikely because of basic differences in outlook and
                            interests which will tend to become intensified and more obvious as the
                            relationship becomes more intimate. Japan already fears Russia and will
                            probably dislike Red China even more in 1961 than it does today. Embassy
                            Tokyo states that the most plausible guess is “that Japan will be a
                            sensitively independent, though often hesitant and weak, member of the
                            community of nations, who has diluted her ties with the United States
                            and tries for the most part to play the role of friend to all,
                            antagonist on none”. Japan’s future alignment with the United States
                            rests to a large extent upon the treatment by the United States of such
                            problems as those associated with the Bonins, Ryukyus, presence of
                            United States forces in Japan, war criminals, and trade with the
                            Communist bloc.</p>
                        <p>Japan’s willingness to enter into any realistic regional collective
                            security arrangement by 1961 cannot be counted upon unless we have
                            succeeded in developing greater mutuality of purpose or unless some
                            international crisis provides the spur. The Embassy believes the United
                            States still has a substantial chance to influence Japan to become an
                            equal, voluntary and enduring partner.</p>

                            the countries signatory to the San Francisco Treaty. The question is
                            whether Japan is entitled to give title of them to the Soviet Union. The

                            Japan has already given up at least the northern part of the Kuriles to

                            outcome of the negotiations with the Soviet Union. Other independent
                            countries have an interest in the general situation in the Pacific. If
                            the Secretary could call a conference of countries interested in the
                            Pacific area, the matter could be settled. He said that Article 26 of
                            the San Francisco Treaty has a limitation of three years. The Secretary
                            countered by saying that the three-year clause puts a time limit on the
                            right of other countries to acquire the same rights as the signatories
                            of the Treaty. Since his conversation with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> of August 19,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d92fn3">See <ref target="#d89">Document 89</ref>.</note> the
                            Secretary had cabled Washington and Tokyo about the Japanese desire that
                            a conference be called. Unfortunately, many are absent from Washington
                            at present and they are preoccupied with other problems, including the
                            Suez Conference and the National Conventions. The territorial problem is
                            complicated—a conference might bring in Taiwan as well as the
                            Kuriles.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question from the Secretary, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> expressed the view that one
                            never knows how firm Soviet views are until a question has been placed
                            firmly before them. Until it is placed squarely before them, one cannot
                            guess their reaction. If a given area is important strategically, the
                            Soviets never give in. In reply to a query from Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> said the Soviets wanted a firm agreement
                            about relinquishment of the islands in question. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said that the Soviet Union
                            has air bases on Etorofu and Kunashiri. There were formerly about ten
                            thousand fishermen resident on the islands, but they were expelled by
                            the Russians, and the only residents now are Soviet officials. The legal
                            question is clear. The Japanese surrendered this territory under the San
                            Francisco Treaty with the Allies, among whom the Soviets were not
                            included.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that under the surrender terms the Japanese are
                            entitled only to the full main islands. The Senate, however, had
                            expressed an “understanding” at the time of ratification that the title
                            to the Kuriles did not pass to the Soviet Union. Habomai and Shikotan
                            were not considered part of the Kuriles, and the United States expressed
                            that view at San Francisco. It is difficult to contend that Etorofu and
                            Kunashiri are not part of the Kuriles. At the time of the San Francisco
                            Treaty, the <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> government had
                            asked the <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0237"/>United States to take
                            the position that Habomai and Shikotan were not part of the Kuriles.
                            They did not make a similar request in respect of Etorofu and
                            Kunashiri.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> said that the
                            Soviets insist that they are occupying the islands with the consent of
                            the United States and the United Kingdom and that Japan must accept the
                            decision of these Allies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1"
                                >Bohlen</persName> recalled that there had never been any
                            determination at Yalta what comprised the Kuriles. There was a list of
                            Japanese Islands to be surrendered but the covering document referred to
                            territory “stolen by Japan.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> recalled that when
                            the Soviet Union occupied the Kuriles, they advanced as far away as Urup
                            and asked General <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>
                            whether they might occupy Habomai and Shikotan. This was to forestall
                            their evident intention to occupy Hokkaido as well. The Secretary
                            suggested that if the Soviet Union were anxious to have a treaty, with
                            consequent diplomatic representation in Tokyo, they might give in
                            eventually on the territorial question but that if the military value of
                            the islands were substantial and the sea passage south of these islands
                            were strategically important, the Soviets probably would not give in. He
                            would study the problem from a technical, historical and military
                            standpoint and pass his conclusions to the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>On taking leave, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>
                            stated that his Government would have to decide soon, as the treaty had
                            become a matter of internal politics. He said he would return to Japan
                            through New York, and would arrive in Tokyo on September 3.<note n="4"

                                    Etorofu as not necessarily part of ’the Kuriles’ as that word
                                    has been used in the various war conferences and Japanese peace

                                    the strategic importance to Russia of these two islands against

                        <p>Rarely have we been so baffled as by the developments on this subject
                            over the past week. The Secretary’s statement to Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> that the United
                            States would reserve its rights under Article 26 of the Peace Treaty
                            should Japan recognize Soviet sovereignty over Sakhalin and the Kuriles,
                            was not a staffed position but rather one which the Secretary himself
                            enunciated prior to his departure for London. The then occasion was a
                            request to us by the Japanese Embassy to indicate what the U.S. position
                            would be in this eventuality. The Legal Adviser’s office has dug up a
                            theory in Hyde’s International Law<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">Not
                                further identified.</note> which would support the Secretary’s view
                            that Japan has a residential sovereignty (a different concept we think
                            than residual sovereignty in the Ryukyus but possibly the inspiration
                            for the latter) in the Kuriles and Sakhalin until the sovereignty which
                            she has renounced is transferred to another country. Japan’s recognition
                            of Soviet sovereignty would possibly perfect the Soviet claim, which is
                            consistent with the Secretary’s position that Japan would be conferring
                            a special advantage upon the Soviet Union not extended to signatory
                            powers. There is another possible theory, that Japan has surrendered its
                            interest in the San Francisco Treaty and thereafter has nothing to say
                            about it—a theory which is less dangerous politically but perhaps not so
                            effective. We have had a working group with representatives from <gloss

                            of the Treaty Bureau, who will be in Washington August 27 and 28. The
                            general purport of the position is not to change what the Secretary has
                            already said but to dilute it a little and permit the Japanese to make
                            up their own minds as to what course they will take, rather than place
                            on our shoulders the responsibility for a breaking off of the
                            negotiations which they might decide upon in their own interests in any
                            event. At this writing we are trying to decide whether to recommend a

                                <p>“Q. Mr. Secretary, while you were in London, there were reports
                                    that when you went and met with Minister <persName
                                        corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> of Japan you
                                    discussed the territorial question as involved in a Japanese
                                    treaty with Russia. Could you tell us something about your views
                                    of that treaty?</p>
                                <p>“A. Well, this is at the moment primarily a matter between the
                                    Japanese Government and the Soviet Union. The Japanese Foreign
                                    Minister told me about the problems that they had encountered at
                                    Moscow and the reason why they had discontinued, temporarily at
                                    least, the negotiations—because of a difference of opinion about
                                    the territorial clause. But he was reporting the developments to
                                    me more than anything else.</p>
                                <p>Q. Well, Mr. Secretary, to follow that up, you were quoted in
                                    some reports as saying that, if Japan recognized the Soviet
                                    claims of sovereignty over the Kuriles, it might open the way
                                    for United States demands for sovereignty over other islands,
                                    particularly Okinawa.</p>
                                <p>A. I pointed out to the Japanese Government—as a matter of fact,
                                    we had done it before I met with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                        >Shigemitsu</persName> in London—that there was an article,
                                    Article 26, of the treaty which did contain a provision that if
                                    a treaty was made with another government on terms more
                                    favorable than the Japanese peace treaty which we had signed
                                    then we would be entitled to claim comparable benefits. That
                                    clause was put in the treaty—I wrote the treaty very largely, as
                                    you may remember—for the very purpose of trying to prevent the
                                    Soviet Union from getting more favorable treatment than the
                                    United States got. I merely reminded the Japanese of the
                                    existence of that clause. I did not attempt to indicate what its
                                    operation would be or that in fact it would be invoked. I merely
                                    pointed out that there was such a clause.”</p>

                                the Secretary asked the Embassy’s opinion of the worth of holding an
                                international conference to determine the status of South Sakhalin
                                and the Kuriles. “See many drawbacks and little possibility

                            Secretary’s concern over consequences of international conference. See
                            no grounds for thinking USSR would attend such conference confined to
                            status Kuriles and Sakhalin, and obviously we would not want to agree to
                            any conference not precisely so limited.</p>
                        <p>There has been some press discussion of possibility of such a conference
                            and idea has been mentioned to us in past in informal conversations.
                            From point of view of Japanese supporters of idea, conference is not
                            only legally correct method (since San Francisco Treaty powers must
                            share in final disposition disputed territories), but would serve shift
                            onus of non-settlement. Apart from attempts Soviets would presumably
                            make to broaden it to include Taiwan and Ryukyus, and bring in Communist
                            China, there would be pressure from within Japan, especially from
                            Socialists, to include discussion of full return of Ryukyus. Since no
                            practical results could be expected, only purpose would be for
                            propaganda and, on balance, we would almost certainly lose.</p>
                        <p>Last evening’s papers cited <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> saying in London that U.S. is considering
                            international parley to decide title to Southern Kuriles, and prominent
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> party official Suma is also
                            quoted as believing conference should be held for that purpose. However,
                            I have no grounds for believing that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            has taken formal position on matter and agree that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>’s suggestion to Secretary was
                            perhaps made on his own responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Our previous line of non-involvement in Soviet-Japanese negotiations,
                            sound though it was, can perhaps no longer be maintained in view of
                            furor here over reports from London. FonOff working level gossip
                            yesterday was that <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> has
                            so thoroughly lost face by the succession of denials and confirmations

                                >Shigemitsu</persName>. I think we can probably best serve our
                            interests in Japan and at the same time give <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> some support, not by favoring international
                            conference, but along following lines.</p>
                        <p>Suggest urgent consideration be given public statement by U.S., and by as
                            many other San Francisco Treaty powers as we can round up in brief time,
                            to effect we support Japan’s interpretation of “Kurile Islands” in
                            Article 2 of Peace Treaty as excluding Etoforu and Kunashiri, that on
                            moral, historical and legal grounds, we believe they should be returned
                            promptly to Japan and that any question of doubt on this point could be
                            referred to ICJ. Association of other San Francisco powers with us would
                            prevent our being isolated in responsibility for final breakdown of
                            negotiations if (as we would expect) Adenauer formula unacceptable to
                            either or both.</p>
                        <p>Domestic political situation in relation to Moscow negotiations is so
                            confused that such action might have disadvantages as well as
                            advantages. I am seeing <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> this
                            evening and other key leaders in next day or two, as appointments can be
                            arranged, and suggest that no final decisions on this be made until I
                            can report results of such conferences.<note n="3" xml:id="d95fn3"><p>In

                            who stated that he was delighted to be in the United States. He planned
                            to spend four days in Washington and then fourteen or fifteen days
                            elsewhere inspecting various facilities after which he would be busy
                            writing up his report. Mr. Masuhara stated that he had no particular
                            matters to discuss but that the six-year rearmament plan was undergoing
                            some revision and that he desired to seek American support. He would
                            discuss this matter on September 6 with the American officials
                            concerned. Mr. Masuhara gave Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"

                            that preparations were being made for the return of the documents as

                            problems were likely to arise during the next few months with respect to
                            Defense Agency. Mr. Masuhara stated that in the next few months nothing
                            special would come up, that the ground forces would be increased by
                            10,000 men <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0243"/>according to plan in
                            the present fiscal year. The Air Self-Defense Force had been making
                            considerable progress in pilot training and in increasing the number of
                            F–86–F’s in operation. This would continue. The main problem for the
                            near future would be the compilation of next year’s budget. Even among
                            the Cabinet Members and the Liberal Democratic Party there were some who
                            felt that the ground forces should not be increased by 10,000 in FY
                            1958. Such an increase would bring them to 170,000. Such an increase
                            also would bring the ground forces to the point where they would have
                            six divisions and four mixed brigades—ten combat units in all. Ten
                            combat units form the present Japanese end goal. In the next following
                            fiscal year (FY 1959) it was planned to increase the ground self-defense
                            force striking power with new weapons and mechanizations. Mr. Masuhara
                            said that some slight changes were currently contemplated, after
                            discussion with MAAGJ, to return forty-nine overage <gloss
                                target="#t_LSSL1">LSSL</gloss>’s to the United States. The United
                            Stated had previously lent fifty <gloss target="#t_LSSL1">LSSL</gloss>’s
                            to Japan. Only one of these would be retained, and to replace the
                            tonnage relinquished, Japan would build one destroyer, one submarine and
                            four submarine chasers.<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">A summary of the

                            unlike the plan for the Ground Self Defense Forces where no particular
                            change is anticipated the Japanese Defense Agency would like to amend
                            the <gloss target="#t_ASDF1">ASDF</gloss> plan. Originally they planned
                            to have twenty-one F–86–F squadrons and six F–86–D squadrons; that now
                            it is planned to increase the six F–86–D squadrons to eight or possibly
                            nine squadrons and correspondingly to reduce the number of F–86–F
                            squadrons to eighteen or nineteen.</p>
                        <p>General Biddle asked about the plans for constructing <gloss

                            Masuhara said that originally the Japanese had thought of purchasing

                            had been to assemble these planes in Japan. This would cost three

                        <p>In the course of the London negotiations between Malik and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTF1">Matsumoto</persName>, the Soviets receded in two
                            minor respects from the territorial position taken at San Francisco:
                            they are willing to return Habomai and Shikotan to Japan and instead of
                            explicit recognition of Soviet sovereignty by Japan will accept treaty
                            language defining the international boundary between the two countries.
                            The Japanese have held out for recognition of their sovereignty over
                            Etorofu and Kunashiri, and the farthest they have expressed willingness
                            to go is acceptance of treaty language like that of variant
                            formulas—including a definition of Japanese territory without any
                            definition of Soviet territory, and including recognition of Soviet
                            sovereignty over the Kuriles and Southern Sakhalin, leaving Etorofu and
                            Kunashiri under Japanese sovereignty (with or without Soviet occupation
                            by analogy to Article 3 arrangements)—but they have not presented these
                            formally to the Soviet Union because of the adamant Soviet stand.</p>
                        <p>Disunity and factional politics have prevented the Japanese from taking a
                            firm stand in dealing with the Soviets. Although there have been
                            effective measures taken in recent months to create public sentiment
                            against the Soviet territorial position, there has been comparatively
                                <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0245"/>little public indignation
                            against the Soviet Union’s blackmailing tactics, partly because the
                            Japanese tend to be cowed by Soviet ruthlessness.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in the attached map and strategic analysis (Tab B), <note

                            military installations on Etorofu and Kunashiri, which it would
                            presumably be willing to give up only for a heavy price.</p>
                        <p>Japan has an excellent case that these two islands have historically
                            always been Japanese, were never taken by Japan by force, and should in
                            fairness be regarded as Japanese in the peace settlement. The islands
                            have been described in Japanese and international usage as part of the
                            Kurile chain, however, and it would be difficult to prove that they are
                            not a part of the Kurile Islands as the term is used in the San
                            Francisco treaty. (Historical study is attached as Tab C). <note n="3"

                        <p>In summary, the Japanese cards, which have not been well played, are the
                            Soviet desire to have a full diplomatic mission in Japan and the
                            possibility of dramatizing before Japanese and world opinion the
                            contrast between Soviet “smiling diplomacy” and Soviet acts. The Soviet
                            cards are the Japanese desires for return of prisoners, entry into the
                            United Nations, and a reasonable fisheries arrangement. It appears that
                            delay affects major Soviet interests much less than it affects major
                            Japanese interests.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese were told in Moscow that without a territorial cession the
                            Soviet Union would not release Japanese prisoners or allow Japanese
                            admission to the United Nations. This represents a hardening of the
                            Soviet position, possibly by reason of all that has taken place in the
                            negotiations on the territorial question. An Adenauer formula would give
                            the Soviets one of the main things they have wanted, however, a mission
                            in Tokyo and full diplomatic intercourse. Although the Japanese who were
                            in Moscow appear convinced it is too late, we cannot be sure that the
                            door is in fact closed, but if such a <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218"
                                facs="0246"/>resolution is possible, it is hard to estimate to what
                            extent the Soviets would accede to Japan’s desires on prisoners, United
                            Nations entry and fisheries.</p>

                        <p>United States good offices would clearly not of themselves avail, and
                            Japan appears to lack the bargaining power to win any further Soviet
                            concessions on the territorial issue. It would accordingly appear that
                            something of definite value would have to be offered by a third power,
                            such as an offer by the United States to surrender bases in Japan or
                            Okinawa or ease security trade controls. This is out of the
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The disadvantages to the United States of calling a conference of
                            interested nations clearly outweigh any possible advantages. Nothing has
                            occurred since San Francisco to make resolvable by international
                            agreement the questions which could not then be resolved. The U.S.S.R.
                            would have the choice of declining to attend, on the ground that the
                            question should be resolved by the U.S.S.R. and Japan, or of attending
                            and seeking to turn it into a general Far Eastern conference, involving
                            the status of Taiwan, Korea, and perhaps the Ryukyus. The Soviet Union
                            would presumably insist Communist China be invited.</p>
                        <p>It appears doubtful that the Japanese will derive practical advantage in
                            their negotiation with the U.S.S.R. from Article 26 of the San Francisco
                            treaty, first, because the Japanese themselves are reluctant to accept
                            the applicability of this article and, second, because the U.S.S.R.
                            might conclude that action by the United States under this article would
                            hurt us politically without basically altering the strategic
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Other possible courses have been considered but appear infeasible,
                            including United Nations trusteeship for Etorofu and Kunashiri, a United
                            Nations expression on the rights of Japan and the U.S.S.R., and an
                            effort to obtain Japanese admission to the United Nations through
                            admission of Outer Mongolia.</p>

                        <p>If we cannot directly assist Japan in its negotiations, there may be
                            steps which would strengthen our bonds with Japan by way of contrast
                            with Soviet imperialism. Any demonstration of moral support would be of
                            some value from this standpoint, such as a declaration that we believe
                            Japanese claims to Etorofu and Kunashiri are just. Similar statements
                            could well be obtained from other powers, as suggested by Ambassador

                        <p>In the light of Japanese reactions, it appears wise to avoid any explicit
                            statement of our rights under Article 26 and to assert simply that
                            having renounced sovereignty over the territories, Japan does not have
                            the right to determine the question, which is of concern to the
                            community of nations, not to Japan and the Soviet Union alone. This
                            formulation would enable the United States to reserve all its rights,
                            whatever they may be, and to refuse to recognize Soviet sovereignty even
                            if Japan should ultimately purport to do so. (See memorandum of Acting
                            Legal Adviser, attached, Tab E). <note n="5" xml:id="d97fn5">Reference

                        <p>This formulation also would avoid the responsibility which the United
                            States could assume if it states that it may assert sovereignty over
                            Southern Sakhalin and the Kuriles. There is a serious possibility that
                            in Japanese eyes this would place the responsibility for a breakdown of
                            the negotiations squarely upon the United States. The decision whether
                            to execute a treaty on Soviet territorial terms if none better seem
                            obtainable is a grave one which should truly be made by Japan, and while
                            it may be preferable from the standpoint of United States interests that
                            it be made in the negative, that is only true if we are not chargeable
                            with having forced the issue.</p>

                                            conclusion whether any further Soviet concessions would
                                            be made but our experience indicates that only patience
                                            and resoluteness can exact the final Soviet position.
                                            Soviet strategic interest makes it unlikely that the
                                            Soviet Union will surrender control of Etorofu and
                                            Kunashiri, but this does not necessarily affect the
                                            possibility of a treaty formula by which Japan does not

                                            appears possible that this is a bargaining device and

                            <head>DRAFT AIDE-MÉMOIRE</head>
                            <p>Pursuant to the recent conversations in London between the Japanese
                                Foreign Minister, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                    >Shigemitsu</persName>, and the Secretary of State, Mr.
                                    <persName>Dulles</persName>, the Department of State has
                                reviewed the problems presented in the course of the current
                                negotiations for a treaty of peace between the Union of Soviet
                                Socialist Republics and Japan, and on the basis of such review makes
                                the following observations:</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States believes that the state of war
                                between Japan and the Soviet Union should be formally terminated and
                                normal diplomatic relations established. Such action has been
                                overdue since 1951, when the Soviet Union declined to sign the San
                                Francisco Treaty.</p>
                            <p>Although Japan is fully qualified for membership in the United
                                Nations the Soviet Union has cynically used its veto to exclude
                                Japan. The Soviet Union has flagrantly violated its obligation to
                                return Japanese prisoners of war. It has callously conditioned
                                arrangements governing fisheries on the execution of a treaty of
                                peace. The United States regards these actions as incompatible with
                                the pretensions of the Soviet Union to friendship with Japan and
                                believed they give ground for concern with respect to the manner in
                                which the Soviet Union can be expected to conduct its future
                                relations with Japan.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the territorial question, as the Japanese Government
                                has been previously informed, the United States regards the
                                so-called Yalta agreement as simply a statement of common purposes
                                by the then heads of the participating powers, and not as a final
                                determination by those powers or of any legal effect in transferring
                                territories. The San Francisco Peace Treaty (which conferred no
                                rights upon the Soviet Union because it refused to sign) did not
                                determine the sovereignty of the territories renounced by Japan,
                                leaving that question, as <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0249"
                                />was stated by the Delegate of the United States at San Francisco,
                                to “international solvents other than this treaty”.<note n="7"

                            <p>It is the considered opinion of the United States that by virtue of
                                the San Francisco Peace Treaty Japan does not have the right to
                                determine the sovereignty over the territories renounced by it
                                therein, and that this is not a matter to be resolved by agreement
                                between Japan and any single Allied Power. The United States would
                                not be bound to accept any action of this character and would have
                                to reserve all its rights.</p>
                            <p>The United States has reached the conclusion after careful
                                examination of the historical facts that the islands of Etorofu and
                                Kunashiri (along with the Habomai Islands and Shikotan which are a
                                part of Hokkaido) have always been part of Japan proper and should
                                in justice be acknowledged as under Japanese sovereignty. The United
                                States would regard Soviet agreement to this effect as a positive
                                contribution to the reduction of tension in the Far East, and
                                speaking for itself would be inclined in that event to review its
                                position with respect to the remainder of the Soviet claim.</p>

                                proposed aide-mémoire and oral statement, both supra, and requested
                                the Embassy’s comments on the two drafts. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, 661.941/9–356)</note> Consider general approach and
                            content excellent but have following comments:</p>
                        <p>Suggest opening clause of aide-mémoire refer with more precision to fact
                            of Japanese initiative in making request to Secretary and to
                            relationship of request to San Francisco Treaty, which relationship of
                            course gives us legitimate grounds for comment.</p>
                        <p>Inclusion of third paragraph in aide-mémoire would expose US in Japan to
                            charge of fighting cold war here and, in my opinion, would be
                            counter-productive. These statements, while fully valid, are best said
                            by Japanese themselves and this paragraph would better be part of oral
                            presentation in point (d) with additional suggestion to Japanese by us
                            that authoritative Japanese spokesmen make these points clearly
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>Fear reference to reservation of rights in paragraph 5 will provoke new
                            round of charges that our innermost intention is to seek device to claim
                            permanent possession Ryukyus. If any reference this point nevertheless
                            considered essential, suggest it be handled by deleting last sentence
                            paragraph 5 and inclusion in oral statement along broadened <pb n="223"
                                xml:id="pg_223" facs="0251"/>lines such as “in opinion of U.S. none

                            rights.”</p>

                        <p>509. Eyes only Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>Dear <persName>John</persName>: Here is my personal thinking about the
                            Russian Treaty situation:</p>
                        <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0252"/>
                        <p>A solution is not to be found in ingenuity of formula, negotiating skill
                            or persuasive oratory. It is to be found in the nature of the Japanese
                            nation’s reaction to Soviet toughness. If the result of that toughness
                            is to bring about increasing Japanese hostility toward Communism, both
                            as regards the Soviet Union and mainland China, then I believe there is
                            a fair chance that the Russians will take a compromise territorial
                            formula the Japanese could live with. If, however, the result is to
                            strengthen the hand of those within Japan who believe that they should
                            be more conciliatory toward the Communists, then of course the Russians
                            will persist in their tough policies. The answer is thus to be found not
                            in any territorial conference or in any special form of negotiation, but
                            within the hearts and minds of the Japanese people themselves. They and
                            they alone can provide the answer.</p>
                        <p>With respect to our own talks with the Japanese, I cannot indefinitely
                            accept a situation which puts our relations on an “out of channels”
                            basis. In the long run this will involve serious risks. I believe that
                            you must deal primarily with the Foreign Office and that I cannot
                            exclude dealing with the Japanese Ambassador.<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2"
                                >A number of documents in Department of State files indicate that

                                hand him the aide-mémoire and read the oral statement, but that this

                                the factional situation in Japan’s governing party exacerbated the
                                dangers of premature disclosure of the contents of the two
                                documents, no approach should be made through the Japanese Embassy
                                in Washington. However, in view of the Secretary’s conversations
                                with <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>, the
                                Department still wished that the U.S. views be communicated by the
                                Secretary personally, and therefore suggested that
                                    <persName>Dulles</persName> see <persName corresp="#p_TM1"

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName>: Thank you for your
                                509.<note n="2" xml:id="d100fn2"><ref target="#d99"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Supra.</hi></ref></note> I entirely agree with
                            your concept that success of Japanese-Soviet negotiations depends on
                            reaction of Japanese people to Soviet toughness. There has been an
                            encouraging trend in this direction during recent developments on these
                            negotiations. I believe our proposed action can help carry this trend
                            along.</p>
                        <p>I also agree that in any normal situation it is not advisable to carry on
                            relations “out of channels”. However, in Tokyo we have, I am afraid, a
                            special and most unfortunate situation. The Foreign Office is almost
                            powerless to affect policy and the influence of the Foreign Minister
                            with his Cabinet colleagues is minimal. Moreover he is engaged to
                            considerable extent in trying to salvage his own personal political
                            position. In spite of this, I have endeavored at all times in presenting
                            official United States positions to do it through the Foreign Minister.
                            At same time I have felt it necessary informally to carry on discussions
                            with such people as <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>, and Nemoto, who, in
                            fact, have much more say in making foreign policy than does the Foreign
                            Minister. In absence of the Foreign Minister it would have been useless
                            to conduct type of discussions reported in my 530 <note n="3"

                                the timing of a possible public release of the aide-mémoire had to
                                be coordinated with factional leaders of the <gloss target="#t_LDP1"
                                    >LDP</gloss>. For this reason, it was “imperative” that the
                                Japanese Embassy in Washington take “rigorous steps” to ensure the
                                paper’s secrecy in the interim. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

                            with Japanese Ambassador in Washington but as you will also see, I
                            pointed out certain problems which unfortunately need to be kept in

                            aide-mémoire reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Pursuant to the request made by the Japanese Foreign Minister,
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>, in the
                                    course of recent conversations in London with the Secretary of
                                    State, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, the Department of State
                                    has reviewed the problems presented in the course of the current
                                    negotiations for a treaty of peace between the Union of Soviet
                                    Socialist Republics and Japan, with particular reference to the
                                    interest of the United States as a signatory of the San
                                    Francisco Peace Treaty, and on the basis of such review makes
                                    the following observations.</p>
                                <p>“The Government of the United States believes that the state of
                                    war between Japan and the Soviet Union should be formally
                                    terminated. Such action has been overdue since 1951, when the
                                    Soviet Union declined to sign the San Francisco Peace Treaty.
                                    Japan should also long since have been admitted to the United
                                    Nations, for which it is fully qualified; and Japanese prisoners
                                    of war in Soviet hands should long since have been returned in
                                    accordance with the surrender terms.</p>
                                <p>“With respect to the territorial question, as the Japanese
                                    Government has been previously informed, the United States
                                    regards the so-called Yalta agreement as simply a statement of
                                    common purposes by the then heads of the participating powers,
                                    and not as a final determination by those powers or of any legal
                                    effect in transferring territories. The San Francisco Peace
                                    Treaty (which conferred no rights upon the Soviet Union because
                                    it refused to sign) did not determine the sovereignty of the
                                    territories renounced by Japan, leaving that question, as was
                                    stated by the Delegate of the United States at San Francisco, to
                                    ‘international solvents other than this treaty’.</p>
                                <p>“It is the considered opinion of the United States that by virtue
                                    of the San Francisco Peace Treaty Japan does not have the right
                                    to transfer sovereignty over the territories renounced by it
                                    therein. In the opinion of the United States, the signatories of
                                    the San Francisco Treaty would not be bound to accept any action
                                    of this character and they would, presumably, reserve all their
                                    rights thereunder.</p>
                                <p>“The United States has reached the conclusion after careful
                                    examination of the historical facts that the islands of Etorofu
                                    and Kunashiri (along with the Habomai Islands and Shikotan which
                                    are a part of Hokkaido) have always been part of Japan proper
                                    and should in justice be aknowledged as under Japanese
                                    sovereignty. The United States would regard Soviet agreement to
                                    this effect as a positive contribution to the reduction of
                                    tension in the Far East.”</p>

                        <p>The two governments, after consultation, made the aide-mémoire public on

                            position on the territorial issue in a note presented to the Soviet

                            claim by the United States for the destruction by Soviet aircraft of a
                            B–29 over Hokkaido on November 23, 1954. For text of the note, see <hi

                                >Allison</persName> was making a similar communication in Tokyo at
                            about the same time through Foreign Office channels. He said that the
                            U.S. is willing that the Aide-Mémoire be published, but suggests that
                            until the Japanese Government has examined it and reached its own
                            conclusions on this question, all knowledge of the Aide-Mémoire should
                            be held confidential. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM1"

                        <p>The Secretary then asked if Prime Minister Hatoyama was going to Moscow.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tani</persName> said that there
                            were news reports that a decision had been made that he should go and
                            that the position to be taken had also been reported, the so-called
                            Adenauer formula, with conditions not only with respect to return of
                            prisoners, but also support of Japan’s entry into the United Nations and
                            effectuations of the fisheries pact. He did not know whether these
                            reports were accurate.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how many prisoners the Japanese estimate still to be
                            in Soviet hands. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tani</persName>
                            said that their figure is 11,000, but that the Soviet Union has
                            confirmed only 1,000. As Minister <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> had said here, it appeared that many of them were
                            untraceable. Recently a group of between 150 and 200 had returned from
                            the USSR and there were some among them who were not on any Soviet list,
                            which indicated that the Russians themselves might not know exactly how
                            many there were. The Secretary commented that it is very difficult
                            dealing with the Communists on prisoners, as we have found with respect
                            to the Americans held by Communist China.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say in conclusion that the U.S. wants to be of
                            help to Japan, and has no thought of making difficulties. Its only
                            desire is to be helpful. His reference to Article 26, he said, had been
                            entirely in this spirit, not with any idea of making territorial demands
                            ourselves, but simply to give Japan an argument with the Russians.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tani</persName> said that he
                            understood this and thought that while there had been some original
                            misunderstanding, the Japanese press had gradually come to understand
                            the Secretary’s intent.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had, of course, written the treaty and had
                            inserted this article for the protection of Japan, so that if other
                            countries should make demands upon Japan, Japan would have a basis of
                            resisting by pointing to the San Francisco treaty. All he had done was
                            to recall the purpose of that article. The Ambassador said that he had
                            read the Secretary’s statement at his press conference on this subject
                            and fully understood. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM1"
                                >Tani</persName> referred also to public statements by the United
                            States with respect to its administration of the Ryukyus and to the
                            desire which has been expressed in Japan for some definition of the
                            duration of U.S. administration as consistent with the fact that the
                            U.S. is making no territorial demands.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tani</persName> called attention to
                            the reference in the Aide-Mémoire to the statement made by the U.S.
                            Delegate at San Francisco that the sovereignty of territories renounced
                            by Japan would have to be left to “international solvents other than
                            this treaty”. He understood, he said, that it would not be feasible to
                            call an international conference at this time, but would appreciate it
                            if the Secretary could indicate if he had in mind any other activities
                            of a diplomatic character, for instance, which might be taken in the
                            future when the situation might have changed. The Secretary said that
                            this was a very hard <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0257"/>question.
                            He would say that the processes that he had in mind—and he of course had
                            been the U.S. Delegate at San Francisco who had made the statement—are
                            the whole series of processes that are under way at present. The
                            negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union are a part, as are our
                            own efforts to assist together with any pressures which we may possibly
                            be able to bring about from other governments. He recalled that the
                            Potsdam declaration which had set forth the surrender terms for Japan
                            had referred to limiting Japan’s sovereignty to the four main islands
                            and “such other islands as we determine”. That declaration was in the
                            name of the President of the United States, the President of the
                            National Government of the Republic of China, and the Prime Minister of
                            Great Britain. The Soviet Union had claimed to accede to this document,
                            but he believed the “we” referred to the three countries which had
                            formulated the terms and that they were entitled to an exceptional
                            voice. For instance, if the combined view of these three governments
                            could be obtained and publicly stated that might have great weight. A
                            full conference would open up other questions such as the status of
                            Formosa, which did not appear wise.</p>
                        <p>Basically, the Secretary continued, the USSR is going to be guided by its
                            estimate of Japanese reactions. If the result of Soviet toughness is to
                            bring about increasing Japanese hostility, then the Soviets would be
                            inclined to reconsider. If toughness increased Japanese sentiment toward
                            conciliation with the Communists, obviously the Soviets would continue
                            to be tough. The whole pattern of Soviet conduct was to compromise when
                            met by strength and to remain tough when met by weakness.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tani</persName> said that
                            personally he saw some possible advantage in an Adenauer type formula in
                            that perhaps it would avoid the recognition of Soviet sovereignty,
                            leaving that for future settlement. There has been a considerable
                            stiffening of Japanese opinion but it may take more time, so that
                            accordingly, the question of the northern territories might remain
                            unsettled. It would be important during this period for Japan to have
                            moral support of the free world to help prevent the Russians from
                            continuing indefinitely to cheat. This issue was important for the
                            Japanese nation and for the future of the whole world. The Ambassador
                            recalled that he was in Tokyo as advisor to the Foreign Minister when
                            consideration was being given to commencement of negotiations. Elections
                            were in progress and there was a considerable public opinion in favor of
                            normalizing relations with the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName> had started the negotiations as a way of
                            ventilating the issue, but unfortunately the political situation had
                            deteriorated rather than stabilized. In his opinion, the conservative,
                            constructive elements in Japan have no alternative but to bind
                            themselves more closely to the U.S. and the free world and oppose the
                            Communists. <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0258"/>The Socialists say
                            that if the U.S. is not helpful, they can turn to the continent. This is
                            irresponsible and would mean ruin to Japan, but if the issues are to be
                            ventilated, the support of the U.S. and the free world is essential so
                            that there will be a political stabilization and firming of public
                            opinion on Communist relations. It will be particularly important after
                            the publication of the Aide-Mémoire to handle public opinion in Japan
                            and the world with great care.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed with these last sentiments and said that he thought
                            also that the Japanese should think in terms of hardening their position
                            with respect to Communist China, because pressures to enter into
                            negotiations with Communist China will be put on in turn.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tani</persName> recalled that he
                            received in Tokyo a paper from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM1"
                                >Allison</persName> upon instructions from the Department saying
                            that the U.S. position was that we did not wish to interfere in the
                            negotiations, but did expect Japan to respect the San Francisco treaty
                            system, and that warning was given at that time to be careful about the
                            implications for relations with Communist China. He could assure the
                            Secretary that this had made a deep impression. The Ambassador recalled
                            also that the Japanese Minister of Labor, Mr. Kuraishi, had given
                            assurance to senior officers of the Department when he was here that
                            Japan would not take steps toward closer relations with Communist China
                            without first consulting with the U.S.<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d81">Document 81</ref>.</note> He felt, the
                            Ambassador said, that this question in the long run was a more
                            complicated and a more dangerous one.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he believed that the normalization of relations
                            was more important for the Soviet Union than for Japan. He could say the
                            same things to his Japanese friends that he has had occasion to say to
                            his German friends, that they did not yet realize their growing
                            importance in the world because they have suffered defeat and had to
                            work their way back. Japan should not be in a position of a suppliant.
                            The Russians were anxious to establish diplomatic relations because it
                            would give them through their Embassy Staff opportunities for
                            infiltration and subversion. If, the Secretary said, you are going to
                            allow them to come in to try to subvert you, you should make them pay a
                            price for the privilege.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tani</persName> said that he agreed
                            that subversion was very important in Soviet intentions and was
                            convinced that it is important for Japan to strengthen its internal
                            security. He referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                            >Kono</persName>’s comments on this subject to the Secretary when he
                            returned from Moscow.</p>

                            1956, <note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2"><ref target="#d86">Document

                                <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> mentioned in your
                            letter, have been studied with particular care and with a very sincere
                            desire to develop a harmonious solution for the complex Ryukyuan land
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>As regards the first of the numbered points in your letter, I am very
                            happy to note that, in the meantime, our two Departments working
                            together very closely have found a satisfactory formula which has
                            already been transmitted by cable to the Commander in Chief, Far East,
                            for his guidance. <note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">See <ref target="#d88fn4"
                                    >footnote 4, Document 88</ref>.</note> This formula provides, on
                            the one hand, for the acquisition of long-term interests by lump sum
                            payments, but declares it advisable on the other hand to acquire such
                            interests first to land under permanent facilities and to areas required
                            for manifestly essential training or housekeeping purposes, while other
                            land needed would be acquired at a later date. As has been specifically
                            stated in the aforementioned message to <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1"
                                >CINCFE</gloss>, this policy was expressly designed to permit
                            gaining experience by executing the program first in connection with
                            those areas whose acquisition should cause minimum difficulties.</p>
                        <p>I likewise believe that we are together in our views regarding additional
                            land requirements. I agree wholeheartedly with the Price Report
                            recommendation that acquisition of additional land by our forces in the
                            Ryukyu Islands should be kept to an absolute minimum. In line with this
                            recommendation, <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> as early as July 17, 1956, directed an
                            immediate over-all review of all military land requirements in the
                            Islands. A recent Defense message to <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >General Lemnitzer</persName>,<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4">Not
                                further identified.</note> a copy of which was transmitted to the
                            Department of <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0261"/>State, strongly
                            re-emphasizes the fact, moreover, that any actions or recommendations by
                            him minimizing land requirements are in consonance with Defense
                            thinking.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the last of the three points set forth in your letter, I fully
                            share your belief in the need to study most thoroughly the Ryukyuan
                            aspects that might be involved in the projected change of our command
                            structure in the Far East-Pacific area. I wish to assure you that this
                            complex problem is being given careful attention and at this time it
                            would be impossible to reach even a tentative conclusion on this subject
                            before detailed studies of this problem in its various ramifications
                            have been completed. You will be interested to know that in the
                            forthcoming months there will be many conferences to discuss matters
                            relative to the disestablishment of the existing command in the Far East
                            and the assumption by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> of
                            responsibility for the new command. The Department of State will be
                            informed of the conclusions reached at these conferences.</p>
                        <p>Your suggestion that consideration be given to establishing direct
                            communications on matters of civil administration between the
                            administrative authorities in the Ryukyus and the Department of Defense
                            in Washington is being studied. However, it is doubtful that a solution
                            will be reached until the command channels have been determined at the
                            aforementioned conferences.</p>
                        <p>I regret that I cannot agree with the suggestion that policy guidance on
                            civil matters in the Ryukyus should be a joint responsibility, since
                            this would be inconsistent with the President’s Directive which assigns
                            the responsibility to the Department of Defense. In addition, I feel
                            that such an arrangement would encumber the actual administration of the
                            Ryukyus to an inordinate extent. I appreciate the concern expressed by
                            the Department of State because of the untimely release of the Price
                            Committee Report which stimulated reversionist activities in Japan;
                            however, I do not feel that this incident in any way casts a reflection
                            on the administration of the Ryukyus during the past ten years, which I
                            consider has been quite good when viewed in the light of the very real
                            obstacles which confronted the local authorities during that period.</p>
                        <p>I am greatly encouraged by the progress made recently by our two
                            Departments in finding solutions for some of these most difficult
                            questions pertaining to the Ryukyuan land issue. I am confident,
                            therefore, that the same rate of progress will also be maintained in the
                            future. <note n="5" xml:id="d103fn5">In a memorandum to Acting Secretary

                                    fitting that this has at last been accomplished.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> called on Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> at his office in the
                            Ministry of International Trade and Industry on the afternoon of
                            December 19. The conversation, which lasted for an hour and a half, was
                            conducted in a cordial and friendly atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> began by
                            congratulating Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> on
                            his election to the Presidency of the Liberal-Democratic Party, and also
                            extended his congratulations on Japan’s admission to the United Nations,
                            which the United States most heartily welcomed.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d105fn2">Approved by the Security Council on December
                                12.</note> Japan had <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0264"/>every
                            right to be a member of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and would
                            have a most important role to play. He believed that Japan with her
                            experience and knowledge of Far Eastern affairs would be able to make a
                            valuable contribution as a member of the organization.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> said that Japan was
                            fully aware of the assistance given by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and the American people in
                            securing Japan’s admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and
                            that America’s assistance was deeply appreciated. Japan was now
                            re-entering the family of nations and must assume new responsibilities.
                            In doing so, Japan urgently needed the cooperation and assistance of the
                            US. He believed that Japan with her intimate knowledge of Asian problems
                            could be most helpful.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> emphatically agreed
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> on the need for
                            close cooperation between the United States and Japan and for diligence
                            by both our countries in settling problems which may arise between them.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that
                            this was especially important since the Communist world, including the
                            Chinese Communists as well as the Russians, was constantly seeking to
                            disrupt US-Japan relations. Japan with fifty per cent of the industrial
                            capacity of the Soviet Union was the Communists’ primary goal in Asia,
                            and in their efforts to win over Japan the Communists were constantly
                            seeking to drive a wedge between Japan and the US.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> indicated that he was
                            in general agreement with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s estimate of the situation, and that the
                            Japanese people were aware of the Communist danger. Japan was determined
                            to cooperate fully with the United States and recognized that she needed
                            the assistance of the US in combating the Communist threat. It must be
                            remembered however that Japan at present was in an unhealthy condition.
                            One danger lay in the weakness of the Japanese economy, and it was
                            imperative that the economy be strengthened. There were also a number of
                            relatively small practical problems in US–Japan relations which if left
                            unsolved could further weaken the structure of our relationship and give
                            the infection a chance to grow. The great majority of the Japanese
                            people have friendly feelings toward the United States and appreciate
                            the assistance the US has given Japan; anti-American activities are the
                            work of a small minority. However, there is the danger that
                            anti-American elements will seize upon these small problems and build
                            them into large ones. It is therefore essential that both countries
                            exert all their efforts to settle these problems promptly. In doing so,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> emphasized that both
                            countries must speak with absolute frankness; patience is also required.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> hoped that the US
                            would “bear with” Japan in dealing with these problems. He asked that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> use his influence to
                            obtain US understanding of the Japanese position in this regard.</p>
                        <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0265"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> went on to say that
                            misunderstandings between our two countries often arise, and that it
                            sometimes is very difficult to make the other side understand what one
                            actually thinks. In his own case Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1"
                                >Ishibashi</persName> thought that one source of difficulty lay in
                            his inability to speak English, although he reads English well and
                            widely. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> thought that
                            his inability to convey his views accurately in English had in large
                            measure been responsible for his difficulties under the Occupation which
                            led to his being purged and removed for several years from political
                            life. He had been accused at the time of not cooperating with SCAP;
                            actually however he had been doing his best to make SCAP’s policies
                            succeed. In the course of the conversation Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> referred several times to
                            misunderstandings that had arisen concerning him during the Occupation.
                            He also stressed repeatedly his belief that cooperation between Japan
                            and the United States must be based on complete frankness on the part of
                            both countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> agreed on the
                            necessity for complete candor in our dealings and assured Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> the US would welcome such an
                            attitude on the part of Japan. Japan of course must expect the same
                            degree of frankness regarding our problems on the part of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>As an example of the specific problems potentially capable of causing
                            serious difficulties between Japan and the United States, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> referred to US restrictions on
                            the import of Japanese cotton textiles; he called particular attention
                            to the proposed US tariff on velveteens, which he understood that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> had discussed with
                            Acting Foreign Minister Takasaki. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1"
                                >Ishibashi</persName> said that Japan was extremely anxious to
                            settle the problem on the basis of voluntary restrictions, and he was
                            confident that a mutually satisfactory agreement would soon be worked
                            out. Meanwhile, he hoped that the US would take no action on the matter
                            which might have a “catastrophic” effect on US-Japan relations and cause
                            lasting harm. In this connection Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1"
                                >Ishibashi</persName> said that instructions were being sent to
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> to
                            raise the matter urgently in Washington. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiba</persName> displayed some confusion at this point. He
                            indicated that there was some doubt as to whether any such instructions
                            had been sent to <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName>, or in
                            fact whether <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> definitely
                            was going to Washington—though perhaps there had been new instructions
                            of which he was not aware.) In concluding his discussion of the textile
                            problem Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> said that
                            the Government had been placed in a very difficult position and found it
                            hard to defend American policy and to answer accusations in the Diet
                            that the US, by restricting trade with China on one hand and limiting
                            Japanese imports to the US on the other, was “placing the squeeze” on
                            Japan.</p>
                        <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0266"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said that with regard
                            to the textile problem the State Department was completely in agreement
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> that the matter
                            should be settled on the basis of voluntary restrictions of Japanese
                            exports. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> and his
                            colleagues in the Department would continue to make every effort to
                            achieve a settlement on this basis. He understood that the Presidential
                            decision on velveteen tariffs was scheduled to be announced on December
                            23, before his return to duty in the Department.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d105fn3">The President announced his decision on January 22;
                                see <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> However, the
                            Embassy would cable the Department reporting the Japanese Government’s
                            views on the matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName>
                            pointed out however that the cotton textile issue was a very difficult
                            political problem in the US. It was not the total volume of Japanese
                            cotton exports, which took up only a small portion of the American
                            market, but the concentration in individual categories, e.g., velveteen,
                            which constituted the chief difficulty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Robertson</persName> understood that Japanese velveteen exports had
                            taken up as much as eighty-five per cent of the American market and
                            forced the closing of many mills which were unable to meet Japanese
                            competition. In many instances these mills constituted the only major
                            industry of small towns and their closing had had disastrous effects on
                            the local economies, arousing petitions of protest supported by the
                            entire local population.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> indicated that he
                            could well understand the concern over the impact of foreign imports on
                            domestic industry, since Japan had had somewhat similar experiences in
                            the case of the sewing machine industry.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the impact on the US economy of Japanese textile imports,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> added
                            parenthetically that he hoped arrangements could be worked out sometime
                            in the future for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> to
                            visit the United States, and he indicated that a visit by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> would be most welcome.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> then explained fully
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> the policy of the
                            United States regarding trade with Communist China and the reasons
                            therefor. He pointed out that international communism is still bent on
                            world domination, as events in Eastern Europe and Asia clearly indicate.
                            Communist China is still branded by the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> as an aggressor, is still in a state of war with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in Korea, has refused to renounce
                            the use of force in the Taiwan Straits, and is building up its forces in
                            North Vietnam; there is no indication that the Communists are prepared
                            to “peacefully co-exist” with the West. In building up her vast war
                            machine Communist China urgently needs imports from the West. It is the
                            policy of the United States to make the build-up of this war potential
                            as difficult as possible. This policy is in the interest not only of the
                            US but of other nations of the Free World, including Japan, <pb n="239"
                                xml:id="pg_239" facs="0267"/>and, carrying as it does the main
                            burden of military security, the US believes that it can without apology
                            ask the cooperation of other nations in restricting trade. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> warned that there was a danger
                            that the long term security of all Asia might be jeopardized in return
                            for small and short term trade benefits.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> referred to the
                            difference between the levels of <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                                >CHINCOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                            restrictions. As a result of these differences, though direct trade
                            between Japan and Communist China in strategic items was blocked,
                            Western European countries were shipping substantial quantities of the
                            restricted items to China through the Soviet Union and the satellite
                            countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> thought
                            there were certain “inconsistencies” in the situation.</p>
                        <p>In reply Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> carefully
                            explained the reasons for the difference between <gloss
                                target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> levels. He admitted that under this system some
                            strategic goods did slip through to Communist China. However, the
                            amounts were limited in quantity, and the delays and increased costs
                            involved in obtaining materials through this indirect route severely
                            handicapped the Chinese Communists in building up their war machine.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> said that the
                            Japanese Government does not disagree with the general policy of the
                            United States and the Free World regarding trade with Communist China.
                            However, the US must recognize that the Japanese economic position is a
                            precarious one, and that Japan’s life depends upon foreign trade. He
                            again referred to the widespread feeling among the Japanese people that
                            Japan’s trade in both directions—with the United States and Communist
                            China—was being restricted unreasonably and stressed the difficulties
                            which this raised for the Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said it was important
                            not only that our two Governments understand the problem but that the
                            people be made to understand it as well and to realize that their very
                            freedom is at stake. He said we too had domestic political problems in
                            this field, and that American businessmen would also like to trade with
                            Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> agreed on the need to
                            enlighten the public concerning these matters. He believed, for example,
                            that it was most important for the Japanese people to understand that
                            Japan’s defense efforts were not for the benefit of the US but were
                            necessary for the defense of Japan itself. Japan would welcome any
                            suggestions from the United States which might help to improve public
                            understanding of our mutual problems. In this connection he pointed out
                            that Japan was actively seeking to develop markets and expand
                            investments in Latin America and in Southeast Asia. US assistance in
                            developing these markets would be greatly appreciated by both the
                            Japanese Government and the Japanese people. Among other things Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName>
                            <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0268"/>thought that positive US
                            assistance in this regard would greatly improve Japanese popular
                            attitudes toward the US and would help turn attention away from the
                            problem of trade with Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said that the US was
                            acutely aware of Japan’s need to develop markets for her exports and
                            would continue as she had in the past to assist Japan in every way in
                            developing these markets.</p>
                        <p>As the meeting ended Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName>
                            said he was looking forward to working closely with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> and the Japanese Government,
                            and was confident that we would be able to work out our problems
                            together. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> expressed
                            similar sentiments.</p>

                        <p>Japan is one of the three major countries in Asia and the Western
                            Pacific. Indonesia has a major potential but does not constitute a
                            political force comparable to that of Japan, India and Red China. Japan
                            is the only one with which we have any immediate prospect of building
                            lasting and close ties which would serve the vital strategic and
                            political interests of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The strategic value to the United States of Japan as a close friend and
                            ally is tremendous, and our entire strategic position in the Western
                            Pacific is anchored on Japan. If Japan should evolve into a neutralist
                            or uncommitted state, the problem of United States security would be
                            made infinitely greater and more costly. But in addition to Japan’s
                            strategic importance, her potential usefulness in the non-military
                            aspects of the world struggle is just as great and is likely to increase
                            as the struggle for uncommitted Asia and Africa develops. We therefore
                            need Japan as a friend and ally.</p>
                        <p>Japan has moved ahead rapidly since the Peace Treaty, and the basis upon
                            which our present relationship was established has radically altered
                            since the signature of that Treaty. Japan is now economically <pb
                                n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0269"/>prosperous, diplomatically
                            integrated, and stands at the crossroads in the development of its
                            foreign policy. There are growing indications everywhere that the
                            Japanese, who in the period since their defeat have “rated well back off
                            the pace” in terms of foreign policy and who have been content to follow
                            the lead of the United States, are now feeling that they must assert and
                            express their “independence”. It is clear that in the immediate and near
                            future they are going to make decisions which will vitally affect our
                            interests. There are indications that Japan will increasingly associate
                            itself with the Afro-Asian bloc in the United Nations in the hope of
                            becoming a leader in this grouping. It has already evidenced a strong
                            independent policy in the United Nations by backing Kuriyama for a seat
                            in the International Court of Justice in opposition to our support for
                            Wellington Koo.<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">V. K. Wellington Koo was
                                Ambassador of the Republic of China to the United States, 1946–1956.
                                During 1957 Koo was chosen by the General Assembly to complete the
                                term of Justice Tsu Mo, who had died. In 1958 Koo was elected to a
                                full 9-year term.</note> It has resumed diplomatic relations with
                            the Soviet Union and is cultivating broader economic and social ties
                            with Red China.</p>
                        <p>There are also increasing signs of Japanese discontent with its present
                            role and status, and particularly with its relations with the United
                            States. There are repeated and increasing statements by the Japanese
                            leaders, still in fairly muted tones, that the Security Treaty must be
                            revised and United States military facilities reduced. These signs of
                            discontent are still subtle and under control, but if they break out
                            into the open it will be too late to influence Japan’s policies in a
                            direction which best serves the interests of the United States. If we do
                            not recognize the ground swell which is taking place in Japan and
                            prepare to make inevitable adjustments in time to derive maximum benefit
                            from such adjustments, events will overtake us, force our hand and sour
                            the outcome.</p>
                        <p>In other words, seeing clearly the current that is flowing strongly in
                            Japan as we do, we should now place ourselves in the position to take
                            the initiative at the appropriate moment, in making essential
                            adjustments with Japan rather than permit the situation to deteriorate
                            and become an inflamed domestic political issue to the point that any
                            proposals of ours which might now appear to be reasonable would later be
                            rejected out of hand by the Japanese. We must foster a greater mutuality
                            in Japanese-American relations and make our readjustments, including
                            certain concessions, on a timely basis which will tend to increase the
                            prestige of the Conservative government and reverse the Socialist trend,
                            which is essentially neutralist and to an extent anti-American.</p>
                        <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0270"/>
                        <p>In Japanese-American relations there are a number of vexing problems,
                            some of which we can move on rapidly and others which are longer of term
                            and will require further urgent consideration by our Government. These
                            issues include: war criminals; the Bonin Islands; Okinawa and the

                            be taken to work out with the Japanese in the next two-to-three months
                            solutions of at least two issues—War Criminals, and the Bonin
                            Islands—which are emotional issues in Japan and which, if a reasonable
                            solution were arrived at, would create the necessary friendly atmosphere
                            of mutual cooperation essential to solve the longer term and much more
                            serious issues.</p>

                            solution to the war criminals and Bonin Island problems early within
                            their respective tenures (possibly within two-to-three months’ time),
                            the essential elements of confidence and cooperation would be laid for
                            dealing with problems which are of more fundamental importance from the
                            United States point of view. Such a procedure should encourage the
                            Japanese Government to keep the lid on the more difficult issues looking
                            toward eventual discussions and solutions. There would be a credit of
                            good will to draw upon.</p>
                        <p>I think we must recognize that if we do not take the initiative in moving
                            in this direction, we run the gravest risk of a deterioration of
                            relations between Japan and the United States. We risk seeing all the
                            unrelated contentious issues coming together in a focal point of
                            hostility in the Japanese mind resulting in domestic Japanese
                            convulsions impairing permanently our future relations with Japan. In
                            other words, if we do not act in timely fashion to meet the evolutionary
                            changes occurring in Japan which we now see clearly, we risk finding
                            ourselves in the same position in which the British, and particularly
                            the French, have found themselves in their relations with various Asian
                            and African countries.</p>

                                civilian administration not responsible to the military command.
                                This civilian administration, conducted with due regard for the
                                interests of Japan, would provide a maximum of political protection
                                for United States security and other interests in the Ryukyus and
                                Japan.” The memorandum concluded that “continued military

                            administration of the Ryukyu Islands may in the near future present us
                            with serious problems in the conduct of our foreign affairs which may in
                            turn jeopardize the retention of United States military bases in the
                            islands. As you know, during the past summer there was general,
                            organized opposition in the Ryukyus to the recommendations of the Price
                            Committee Report of such serious nature that the implementation of these
                            recommendations was postponed for further consideration. Although they
                            were directly precipitated by dissatisfaction with the planned land
                            acquisition program, the disturbances were symptomatic of more general
                            discontent with conditions of administration amounting to continued
                            military occupation. The discontent led to increased local pressures

                            A revival of this interplay between the Ryukyus and Japan in the future
                            could present us with diplomatic problems of major importance.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, through accession to the United Nations, close working
                            relations with the Afro-Asian bloc and resumption of formal relations
                            with the USSR, Japan will be in a position to attempt to
                            internationalize the dispute and appeal to the United Nations. Groups of
                            Okinawans in Japan have already petitioned the Soviet Union and other
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member nations to support the
                            reversion of the Ryukyu Islands to Japan. The spectacle of Communist or
                            Asian agitation and support for an international inquiry into the
                            “colonial” administration of the islands must be viewed as a definite
                            likelihood.</p>
                        <p>It is evident, of course, that a favorable local climate is essential to
                            achieve United States objectives in the Ryukyus since hostility of the
                            local population would largely negate the utility of military bases.
                            Opposition in the area would inevitably affect Japanese attitudes toward
                            the United States, particularly with regard to United States bases in
                            Japan. I do not believe that we are immediately confronted with any
                            situation of critical proportions, but am convinced that we have entered
                            a new stage in the administration of the Ryukyu Islands where it is
                            necessary to make modifications or else incur a growing hostility that
                            may endanger our diplomatic and military position in the Far East. An
                            informal but public resolution by Democratic members of the Ryukyuan
                            Legislature on December 19 calling for reversion points up the urgency
                            of the problem.</p>
                        <p>In view of these factors, I suggest that we establish a joint working
                            group composed of representatives of our Departments to review the
                            present administration of the Ryukyu Islands and make such
                            recommendations for change or modification as may be indicated. The
                            present change-over in area command responsibilities from <gloss

                                >CINCPAC</gloss> makes this a particularly propitious moment to
                            consider this question. I do not mean to imply in any sense that the
                            past administration of the Ryukyus has been mismanaged, for I believe
                            under the circumstances it has been well handled, but rather that it
                            appears necessary at this time to take some judicious and timely steps
                            in the direction of local government lest we jeopardize our long-term
                            essential requirements in the islands. I believe the promulgation of the
                            proposed Executive Order on the Civil Administration of the Ryukyus
                            should be delayed pending the formulation, submission, and consideration
                            of the recommendations of this working group.<note n="2"

                        <p>1543. I paid my first call on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IT1"
                                >Ishibashi</persName> this morning since my return. Fact that I was
                            going to call was prominently played up in local press with “dope”
                            stories to effect that I was going to discuss with him defense budget.
                            As usual Japanese press presumably on basis of guidance from government
                            officials, if not official government guidance, has portrayed United
                            States as interfering in Japan’s defense budget preparations. This has
                            been continued today as <hi rend="italic">Kyodo</hi> publishes
                            substantially accurate account of my talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> which I had understood was
                            confidential.</p>
                        <p>During this morning’s conversation I told <persName corresp="#p_IT1"
                                >Ishibashi</persName> that formation of Japan’s defense budget was
                            matter for Japanese to decide but that in making their decision I hoped
                            Japanese would bear in mind certain considerations. I then pointed out
                            if press reports were accurate and Japan’s defense budget would be no
                            larger than last year’s this could only raise questions in minds of
                            American government and Congress as to true intentions of Japan. I
                            stated that now that Japan had become member of United Nations it had
                            been hope of all of us that she would take larger part in international
                            affairs and be influential factor for peace. However, I did not believe
                            it possible for nation to carry great weight in international councils
                            if it continued to depend primarily on another nation for its self
                            defense. At this point I stated specifically that I was speaking
                            personally and most frankly and that I would not wish to say these same
                            things publicly. Nevertheless I am quoted in <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247"
                                facs="0275"/>Japanese press this afternoon as setting forth these
                            ideas. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> is notoriously
                            given to press leaks and in previous government he was often said to be
                            source of embarrassing news stories.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName> that our concern
                            was not so much in form of Japan’s defense budget as in substance. What
                            is important is that there be no backward step in gradual increase in
                            Japan’s defense efforts. <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName>
                            said he quite agreed and it was his firm intention that there should be
                            gradual increase. However primarily for political reasons it would be
                            impossible in present budget to provide for contemplated increase of
                            10,000 men in ground forces although requested personnel increases in
                            air and sea forces would be granted. <persName corresp="#p_IT1"
                                >Ishibashi</persName> claimed that 10,000 man increase would be
                            provided for in next year’s budget which because of difference in fiscal
                            year periods would mean that this increase would take place during
                            United States fiscal year 1958, only few months behind what would be
                            case if it were provided for in this year’s Japanese fiscal year
                            budget.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister was most friendly but also apparently most determined that
                            there be no substantial increase this year in defense budget. He said
                            that increase in contract authorizations and twenty billion yen
                            carry-over from last year’s budget would in fact mean there would be
                            increase in actual defense expenditures over previous year.</p>
                        <p>Far East Command and Embassy representatives are meeting with Japanese
                            representatives this afternoon to endeavor determine whether or not
                            actual increase in defense expenditure will be greater if Japanese carry
                            out their present plans.</p>

                                    Embassy. On the U.S. side, officials of the Departments of
                                    State, Commerce, and Agriculture were all involved directly in
                                    the negotiations. White House representatives included Sherman

                            of the agreement and also serving notice that they should not look
                            toward further escape clause relief. Also, the Institute members were
                            urged to work for the removal of State laws discriminating against the
                                Japanese.<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">For a description of these

                        <p>The President was delighted to have this report. Sec.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> commented that had the negotiations
                            broken down the Japanese would almost assuredly have begun to develop
                            closer relations with Communist China. In response to a query from Sec.

                                <persName>Dulles</persName> stated that the agreement can be
                            reopened to further negotiation should basic conditions change.</p>
                        <p>Sec. Weeks informed the President that he would soon receive a unanimous
                            recommendation to disapprove the velveteen recommendations made by the
                            Tariff Commission.<note n="5" xml:id="d109fn5">On January 22, the

                                taking action on the Tariff Commission’s recommendation of October
                                24, 1956, to apply the escape clause on imports of cotton-velveteen
                                fabrics. For text of the White House press release, January 22, see

                                target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 56). The Japanese have also given
                            official <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0278"/>assurance that the
                            entire carry-over from <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 56, estimated
                            at 231/2 billion yen, will be reappropriated and expended for <gloss

                        <p>In the present negotiations, U.S. military representatives have expressed
                            disappointment on a technical basis with the revised defense proposals
                            and have pointed out that the Six Year Plan, at best minimal and
                            austere, will be further weakened by this revised budgetary action. In
                            response, the Japanese indicated that the revised proposals resulted
                            from political decisions of the highest government and party leaders. By
                            limiting cash appropriations for the Defense Agency to an amount that
                            can be disbursed in the fiscal year, the large annual carry-over will be
                            eliminated, which will serve to counter the impression held by the
                            general public that the Defense Agency is wasting money and receiving
                            funds in excess of its requirements. The personnel augmentation of
                            10,000 men in the Ground Self-Defense Force, planned in the initial
                            budget (127.6 billion yen) for the fourth quarter of <gloss
                                target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 57, will be deferred until the first
                            quarter of <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 58.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy and the Command have concluded that the Japanese revised
                            budget is in reasonable compliance with the April 1956 agreement.
                            Although the defense build-up is not as substantial as we would like,
                            there is little that can be accomplished by objecting and any nominal
                            increase would be gained at the expense of losing the advantage which
                            follows from this year’s defense budget being purely a Japanese
                            responsibility.</p>

                            defense share negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The comments in the stories from Washington on the reaction there have
                            been most helpful and pitched exactly right. To try to assess the gains
                            and losses, certainly there is a slow down in the defense program, but
                            it is useless to hammer them over the head for the sake of getting the
                            appearance of a slightly increased program. If they have not got the
                            will to step it up we shall have to wait until they do. The prime
                            Japanese argument is that the elimination of the carryover and the
                            “qualitative” approach, i.e., postponing the 10,000 man increase in the
                            ground forces, are essential to gain the confidence of the people in the
                            defense effort. We are not sure how much there is to <pb n="253"
                                xml:id="pg_253" facs="0281"/>this argument since the Government has
                            made very little attempt in the past year or two to gain the confidence
                            of the people for the defense build–up. We shall, in any case, have to
                            wait until after the elections to see what course they take. On the
                            positive side, there is the important dividend, foreseen in the nature
                            of the agreement made last year, that this year it is their budget and
                            not something forced on them by the U.S. There is growing recognition of
                            this result and even a little bewilderment. Some of the Japanese press
                            are still under the weight of the old attitudes. We understand the
                            Socialists are dismayed at seeing such a hardy perennial in the way of
                            issues on which to criticize the Government taken away from them.</p>
                        <p>MAAG is studying the revised program to see whether it will mean a slow
                            down or postponement in the delivery of equipment included in the 1957
                                <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> program and we shall report on
                            this aspect in due course.</p>

                                <p>“In the event of limited or localized hostilities, it is
                                    uncertain that Japan, in view of its present political
                                    attitudes, would permit the United States to use Japanese soil
                                    as a staging area and base of operations. This was done during
                                    the hostilities in Korea, but at that time Japan was an occupied
                                    country. Today as a sovereign nation, Japan has failed to
                                    develop its runways, has been reluctant to provide training
                                    areas, has protested the use of firing ranges, has trembled at
                                    the introduction of the ‘Honest <persName>John</persName>’
                                    rocket, has indicated lack of concurrence in the storage in
                                    Japan of atomic war heads, and has failed to provide for the
                                    adequate development of its own forces. Fear of involvement
                                    might cause Japan to deny the use of its facilities to the
                                    United States. In its present temper, it would certainly be a
                                    reluctant ally whose lack of cooperation, already demonstrated
                                    in time of peace, would greatly reduce its effectiveness.</p>
                                <p>“In the event of a world conflict, the problem of supplying
                                    Japan, assuming it were a fully cooperative ally, would be one
                                    of very great magnitude. Food, cotton, wool, petroleum, iron ore
                                    and coking coal alone would amount to a minimum of 20 million
                                    tons of imports annually. Despite Japan’s large maritime fleet,
                                    shipping and convoy requirements would be enormous. Whether
                                    under such circumstances, Japan could be maintained as a
                                    dependable source of munitions appears open to question.
                                    Industrial capacity, if it could not be adequately provided with
                                    requisite raw materials, would be of little assistance to

                                    Japan in the event of a world conflict might seek to remain
                                    neutral to profit by trade wherever it could be found. Japanese
                                    recall that their country emerged from World War I as a major
                                    power, and they contrast that position with the results of World

                        <p>The despatch under reference is in support of the thesis that, in view of
                            Japan’s strategic vulnerability, the United States should not depend
                            upon Japan as a trustworthy source of munitions to satisfy either direct
                            or indirect requirements of the United States in the event of
                            hostilities. The despatch emphasizes that in pointing out the danger of
                            over reliance upon Japan in time of hostilities, it is not intended to
                            underplay the value to the free world of a strong non-Communist Japan,
                            even if not allied to or dependent upon the United States.</p>

                                the past several days there have been a number of press reports,
                                attributed to sources in the Department of Defense, concerning the

                            despatch from Washington stating that, according to authoritative
                            sources, stationing of atomic task forces in Japan probably to be

                            UP story attibutes lack of final US decision on atomic task force to
                            differences between State and Defense; while “military officials”
                            contend they should be permitted defend with “smaller atomic weapons”.
                            State Department “is opposed to sending task force to Japan at least at

                        <p>AP Washington January 24 story apparently based on discussion with “US
                            defense officials” puts matter in better perspective by taking account
                            of Japanese opinion and control over decision but nevertheless serves to
                            keep issue alive.</p>
                        <p>Initially Japanese had tended scoff at Soviet threat and Cabinet
                            Secretary had labeled it “bluff” and denied Japan supplying atomic bases
                            to US. Combined with repetition of Soviet threat of retaliatory Soviet
                            atomic attacks on US bases in Japan, net effect of press discussion will
                            now be to harden attitudes and still further postpone time when really

                            story. Inquiry ostensibly motivated by desire prepare for anticipated
                            Diet inquiries on staging atomic task force in Japan, but nature of <pb

                            Office testing our willingness actually consult on this matter. Four
                            specific questions were raised: (1) what are actual US plans with
                            respect First Cavalry withdrawal and deployment atomic units to Japan;
                            (2) does US intend full consultation as press release states or in fact
                            continuation past practice of providing <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> with “advance information”; (3) does US statement mean
                            we now willing give assurance of advance consultation on storage of
                            atomic weapons. Foreign Office official referred in this connection to
                            position taken confidentially by Embassy in June 1955 that no “mutual
                            understanding”—as claimed publicly by <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                                >Shigemitsu</persName>—existed on advance consultations on nuclear
                            storage. He anticipated <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            would be pressed by Diet to confirm this “understanding”; (4) how are
                            atomic task forces organized.</p>
                        <p>AP story noted above attributes to “authoritative sources” statement that
                            “whole policy” on placing atomic weapons in Japan “rests with the
                            Japanese for a decision”. This is of course not a direct statement of
                            official US policy but it goes considerably further than we have yet
                            gone officially and it may make difficult if not impossible adherence to
                            our 1955 position.</p>
                        <p>While recognizing difficulties posed by Foreign Office questions, we
                            would appreciate guidance on what may be said to Foreign Office at this
                                time.<note n="4" xml:id="d114fn4">The Department, in telegram 1590
                                to Tokyo, January 28, replied that it had no knowledge of the UP and
                                AP stories described by the Embassy, which had apparently not been

                                was advised to tell the Foreign Office that the press release spoke
                                for itself and should be cited without interpretation in response to
                                any inquiries in the Diet. Concerning the organization of the

                        <p>The salient feature of the draft Progress Report is its thesis that
                            Japanese-American relations have entered a period of adjustment and that
                            greater mutuality in the relationship is required if the United States
                            is to win and keep Japan as a firm ally in the Pacific. Japan’s improved
                            economic situation, improved diplomatic position, and restoration of
                            relations with the Soviet Union all tend to lessen Japan’s dependence
                            upon the United States and to encourage more independence. As a
                            consequence, Japan has entered a period in which it is now making
                            decisions of lasting significance to the United States, both with
                            respect to our defensive posture and to our position in the cold war
                            with communism.</p>
                        <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0286"/>
                        <p>Various points of friction exist between Japan and the United States;
                            these are mentioned in full in Section B and include such points as the
                            Bonin Islands, the Ryukyu Islands, United States force levels in Japan,
                            relations with Communist China and trade problems. If Japan is to make
                            the type of decisions which will improve our global posture rather than
                            weaken it, these frictions must be alleviated in the near future.</p>
                        <p>The Progress Report concludes that our basic policy is still sound but
                            that there must be a greater application of the principle of mutuality
                            if the basic assumption of our policy—Japanese alignment with the United
                            States—is to be fully realized.</p>
                        <p>There are no areas of disagreement with other agencies represented in the
                                <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> with respect to the paper.
                            However, there are potential areas of disagreement with Defense with
                            respect to the Bonin Islands and the Ryukyu Islands: Navy continues to
                            press that United States security interests in the Pacific exclude the
                            possibility of repatriating Bonin Islanders; Defense is not as conscious
                            of nor responsive to the civil problems in the Ryukyus as State feels is
                            necessary. With respect to trade problems, Commerce is not fully
                            conscious of the implications and possible reaction of third countries
                            in terms of restricting imports from Japan, with the attendant weakening
                            of Japan’s needed economic strength.</p>
                        <p>The paper does not consider the question of future goals of American
                            policy toward Japan. The Secretary himself has stated in discussions
                            inside the Department that a reasonable goal for us is a mutual defense
                            arrangement with Japan.</p>

                            Japanese war criminals in a manner consistent not only with United

                            indicated, however, that the President was sympathetic with the view
                            that this problem in United States-Japanese relations should be
                                eliminated.<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">By February 11, the

                            domination, the fact of the planning and execution of their plans must
                            of necessity have left a large volume of knowledge in Japan about the
                            specific economic aspects of regional cooperation. This knowledge could
                            be beneficial at the present time in evaluating the proposal which Mr.

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that the
                            recent discussions between the United States and Japan had culminated in
                            the announcement by Japan of a wide range of export quotas for 1957.
                            However, on the day of the announcement of these quotas, additional
                            legislative proposals had been introduced in both the States of South

                            cotton textiles from Japan. This action, coupled with the expectation by
                            the Japanese that their action would solve the textile problem, has put
                            the Japanese Government in an exceedingly difficult position and can
                            well have serious repercussions involving a great many other aspects of
                            United States-Japanese relations. The Secretary was asked to urge again
                            the Attorney General to institute legal action against State laws which
                            came into being in South Carolina and Alabama last year. The Secretary
                            asked for full information on the reaction in Japan to the State laws to
                            provide a basis for a further approach to the Attorney General.</p>

                            principal issues would arise when facts had been fully
                            established—jurisdiction, fair compensation and prevention of

                            importance of handling issue so as to minimize adverse effects. I said
                            that facts were not yet established and I had no instructions but wished
                            to comment personally on jurisdiction issue. (We had had indications

                            circumstances should suggest possibility of Japanese jurisdiction, means
                            would be found for <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to avoid
                            attempting to exercise it. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            urged that no official comment be made on either side on such issues as
                            jurisdiction until facts fully established and until there had been
                            opportunity for consultation between two governments on best means of
                            solving issue in interest of overall relations. I hope Department will
                            do best to insure that there will be no premature speculation on, or
                            prejudgment of, issues involved in case attributed in press to official
                            sources. Line should be that it happened, that regret has been
                            expressed, that investigation is being conducted and that until all
                            facts available and fully studied, it is inappropriate to make any

                                United States by prematurely forcing (either accidentally or
                                intentionally) security issues, was “hardening attitudes, forcing
                                government to take more categorically negative position than would

                        <p>Mr. Seidman and Mr. Per-Lee called to discuss the problem of the legal
                            basis for our administration of the Ryukyus. Mr. Seidman said that he
                            would be leaving a week from Thursday for a trip to Japan and
                            Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Seidman was much concerned that our administration of the islands was
                            based only on the so-called “Presidential directive”. He explained that
                            this was in reality only a Department of Defense Directive that had been
                            initialed as approved by the President. It was intended only as a
                            temporary stopgap measure when it went into effect in 1954.</p>
                        <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0293"/>
                        <p>He said there were many problems regarding the irregularities of the
                            present administration. He cited as one the issue of B yen—which is
                            really occupation currency and therefore should be backed up by the
                            occupied country. In this case there is no such country and therefore no
                            authority for the issue of the money.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Seidman said that separating the administrative authority from the
                            military command might cause serious problems for the Administrator. He
                            cited the example of Guam where the Navy cut off most logistic support
                            including electricity, the governor’s servants, etc. There it took a
                            year to straighten things out. He opined that in Okinawa the civil
                            administration and military activities were so intertwined that
                            separation might well prove not only difficult but impossible. Also
                            there will be serious problems in the suggested new command structure
                            with the Governor concurrently <gloss target="#t_USARPAC1"
                                >USARPAC</gloss>—i.e., not the Theater Commander and not located in
                            Japan. (As he is not part of the Theater Commander’s setup, he will have
                            difficulty insuring that the Theater Commander takes proper cognizance
                            of the Ryukyus. As he is not located in Japan he will himself lack
                            sensitivity to Japanese feelings toward the Ryukyus.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Parsons</persName> said that he was primarily worried about
                            preserving our military position in Okinawa which will be of increasing
                            importance as we reduce our military bases in other Far East areas. The
                            Ryukyus will certainly be a major issue between Japan and the United
                            States. The military have shown that they are politically
                            unsophisticated (they wanted to throw out Senaga)<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d119fn2">Kamejiro Senaga was removed from office as Mayor of
                                Naha, Okinawa, on November 23; see <ref target="#d249">Documents
                                    249</ref> and <ref target="#d251">251</ref>.</note> and this
                            will greatly complicate the Ryukyuan problem in United States–Japan
                            relations. He pointed out that if we weren’t careful we might get kicked
                            out of the Ryukyus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Seidman agreed that this was true and said that it was another reason
                            why the basis and structure of the administration should be regularized.
                            He then presented a brief history of Ryukyuan administration, the
                            “Presidential” Directive, and the draft Executive Order: A civil
                            administration for the Ryukyus was originally provided by Proclamation
                            13 of the Military Government. To this day, this is the only publicly
                            known “constitution” for the Ryukyus. In December of 1952, Bureau of
                            Budget sent a letter to State and Defense suggesting that the
                            administration be regularized. This resulted in a stalemate between the
                            two Departments. The matter was referred to the National Security
                            Council but no solution was reached. The undecided issues were whether
                            or not to return the islands to Japan and how they were to be
                            administered. Early in 1954 the President took the problem out of the

                            to a military administration. The “Presidential” Directive is the result
                            of this meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">For documentation on
                                circumstances attending the approval of the Directive by the

                            which was submitted for Presidential approval without careful rewriting
                            and without clearance. The Directive clearly makes all <gloss
                                target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss> executive offices elective. It
                            completely subordinates the <gloss target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss>
                            executive branch to the legislative. In any case, as it is just a
                            Defense operations directive it cannot have the force of law. Among
                            other things, the court structure it provides is incomplete—there are no
                            appellate courts and no civil courts having jurisdiction over American
                            contractors. The draft Executive Order was prepared to take the place of
                            the Directive. By the end of 1955, agreement on a draft had been reached
                            between State and Defense. Then General Gailey <note n="4"
                                xml:id="d119fn4">Major General Charles K. Gailey, Chief of Civil

                                target="#t_CAMG1">CAMG</gloss> and wanted the Order resubmitted to
                            the field for comments. This was completed in early 1956. The Order was
                            then held up pending March elections in the Ryukyus, afterwards because
                            of the Price Report and subsequent land agitation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Seidman wanted to emphasize the necessity of issuing the Executive
                            Order as soon as possible. He pointed out that in the coming months,
                            under pressure from Congress and possibly from other nations in the
                            United Nations, we may be forced to make public the instrument on which
                            we base our administration. He said that it would be very embarrassing
                            to make the Directive public as (1) since it is only a Defense directive
                            it has no legal validity, (2) the administration of the islands does not
                            and can not follow the provisions of the Directive, (3) it is classified
                            and therefore the Ryukyuans have never been informed of the basic “law”
                            or constitution of their own government, (4) as there is no legal
                            validity to the Directive, Congress might well withdraw budgetary
                            support. As the <gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss> had assumed that the
                            Executive Order would be in effect this year, the budgetary provisions
                            for the administration of the Ryukyus are based on the Executive
                            Order.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Seidman maintained that promulgating the Executive Order would not
                            interfere with our attempts to persuade Defense to convert to a civilian
                            administration. While it is true that the Executive Order does delegate
                            administrative authority to Defense (under present provision authority
                            has never been delegated) and does provide that the Governor should be a
                            military officer on active duty, these two provisions could easily be
                            changed at some later date. He maintained that even if successful, our
                            discussions with Defense and subsequent changes of the Administration
                            would take at least two years and that <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267"
                                facs="0295"/>the Executive Order was desperately needed to fill the
                            existing gap. He emphasized the desirability of not being forced to
                            publish the existing Directive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Seidman summarized his position: Although he had originally felt that
                            the civil administration should be separated from the military command
                            and placed under civilian control, careful study of conditions on
                            Okinawa had led him to change his mind. He has become convinced that the
                            military and civil affairs activities are too inextricably intertwined
                            to be separated and therefore it is necessary to continue the civil
                            administration as part of the military command. He is very apprehensive
                            over the effect of the coming command changes in the Pacific on Ryukyuan
                            administration (he had noticed a reversal in the trend toward
                            “civilianizing” <gloss target="#t_USCAR1">USCAR</gloss>—the appointment
                            of several colonels to fill positions which had been held by
                            civilians—and discovered that this was at the instigation of <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>) and does not see how it could
                            possibly work. However, promulgating the Executive Order need not have
                            any effect on long-range administrative changes which we hoped to make
                            and it would provide a legal foundation for our administration of the
                            islands and get us off the hook of having to publish the “Presidential”
                            Directive.</p>
                        <p>He discussed the proposed organic legislation currently before the <gloss
                                target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss> for its consideration and to which
                            State has expressed objection, and he agreed that the more usual and
                            probably more desirable way to phrase it would be to have it simply
                            place administrative responsibility in the executive and not specify to
                            whom the President will delegate authority. Although he said there was
                            need for such organic legislation, it was not urgent as was the need for
                            the Executive Order. In his opinion, the legislation would not pass
                            Congress this session in any case.</p>

                        <p>1814. I made my first call on <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            last evening to present letter of credence and recall.</p>
                        <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0296"/>
                        <p>After usual amenities I said that although I had not previously served in
                            Japan I had in past four years spent considerable time on matters
                            concerning Far East and South and Southeast Asia. I nevertheless had
                            much to learn about Japan and would want advice and counsel from him. I
                            felt two countries had same fundamental purposes, principles, and
                            objectives. Problem was to find solutions to specific problems which
                            Japanese govt would feel met its own interests and which we would feel
                            met ours. It was important that on both sides there be free and frank
                            discussion of these problems as they were seen by respective sides.
                            Without such discussion I doubted it would be possible to reach most
                            constructive agreements which would satisfy our mutual interests and
                            requirements of both sides. I concluded by stressing importance of
                            conducting talks and negotiations in private without glare of news
                            publicity on day-to-day developments.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said he welcomed this
                            approach and fully agreed with importance frank discussions. It had been
                            his custon with <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Allison</persName> and he
                            hoped have same close relations with me both officially and “in a
                            private capacity”.</p>
                        <p>I said that even before presenting credentials there was one matter I
                            would like to mention. This was question of economic development of SEA,
                            to which I knew Japanese leaders had given much attention. I expressed
                            belief this was field in which I felt there was room for cooperation and
                            constructive action. However we would need to know in considerably more
                            detail than we know now Japanese views in light their great experience
                            before we could study what might be done. I expressed personal view it
                            important initiative this field come from Asians rather than United
                            States. I asked <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to designate
                            officials with whom Mr. Waring could at once start such detailed but
                            confidential conversations. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            welcomed idea and said he would designate someone with whom Waring could
                            pursue question.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> raised no matters of
                            substance and was very friendly although obviously somewhat preoccupied
                            with domestic political situation revolving about <persName

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I wish to call to your
                            attention a series of press reports concerning an Atomic Task Force and
                            atomic-capable guided missiles for Japan, attributed to sources in the
                            Department of Defense, which have evoked a most unfortunate reaction in
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The initial reports, datelined Washington on January 16 and 17, concerned
                            the withdrawal of the First Cavalry Division from Japan and the possible
                            assignment of an Atomic Task Force to Japan. In order to counter the
                            adverse effect of these reports in Japan, the Department of State and
                            the Department of Defense issued a joint press release denying that
                            decisions of this character had been made.<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2"
                                >See <ref target="#d114">Documents 114</ref> and <ref target="#d118"
                                    >118</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>In reliance on this press release, Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> was able to counter successfully
                            Socialist interpellations in the Japanese Diet attacking the Government.
                            However, the disclosure, attributed to authoritative United States
                            military sources in Tokyo, that the United States planned to install
                            Matador guided missiles on Formosa led to a series of press reports from
                            Washington, based upon Department of Defense statements, concerning the
                            provision of guided missiles to Japan.<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3"
                                >Documentation on this second group of press reports, which appeared
                                in late January and early February, is in Department of State,

                                Files: FRC 61 A 1672, 471.6 Japan. Materials in the latter file
                                indicate that the Japanese Government had, through the MAAG in
                                Japan, requested samples of guided missiles for inspection and
                                research purposes in November 1955, and that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had in May 1956 expressed itself
                                favorably regarding the request. No action had been taken, however,
                                because of what U.S. officials perceived as an inadequate security
                                system in Japan.</note> The feasibility and timing of a press
                            release on the installation of Matador missiles in Formosa was at that
                            time under “top secret” consideration in the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>The press reports concerning the furnishing of guided missiles to Japan
                            were particularly unfortunate in that they caused the Japanese to tie
                            together the issue of United States–furnished equipment and Japanese
                            security legislation. As a result of this publicity, the Director
                            General of the Japanese Defense Agency announced on February 8 that the
                            Japanese Cabinet had decided to cancel plans to introduce in the present
                            Diet session legislation to protect security of military information.
                            Legislation of this sort is essential to the interests of the United
                            States in our relations with Japan.</p>
                        <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0298"/>
                        <p>A further and more serious consequence which followed upon opposition
                            attacks on the Japanese Government based upon these press reports was a
                            decision by the Japanese Cabinet that assent, if asked for, would not be
                            given to the stationing in Japan of an Atomic Task Force. [<hi

                        <p>In view of the great sensitivity which attaches to the question of atomic
                            weapons in Japan, I would suggest that any announcements which are

                            before next year or latter part this year at earliest. He said in
                            addition to Prime Ministership he would retain Foreign Ministry and
                            wished work closely with me.</p>
                        <p>I said I knew he would be much preoccupied this week in organizing his
                            government and did not wish press him for early meeting but would like
                            call on him to have good general discussion about <pb n="271"
                                xml:id="pg_271" facs="0299"/>pending issues between our two

                                >Kishi</persName> was most cordial and friendly and indicated he
                            also wanted go over common problems with me at an early date.</p>
                        <p>While obviously <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> has delicate
                            internal political situation and will wish avoid charges he is too
                            pro–American, our judgment is we will be able to do business on better
                            basis with him than <persName corresp="#p_IT1">Ishibashi</persName>.
                            Therefore I would like be in position when I see <persName

                            President would welcome his visiting US some time in May if this
                            feasible from his viewpoint. In terms our over–all objectives and new
                            situation we entering in our relations with Japan, I think very

                            Washington May 8–10 where he would stay President’s guest house. I said
                            if he accepted invitation White House desired earliest possible
                            simultaneous announcement Washington–Tokyo, and White House would like

                            making quite clear purpose of visit is for useful discussions topics of

                            specific problems. I explained text of announcements both Tokyo and
                            Washington must avoid building up false expectations as to purpose and
                            nature visit since obviously in three-day visit it would not be possible
                            negotiate out agreements on specific issues. I concluded by emphasizing
                            invitation must be held in strictest confidence until announcement
                            made.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> deeply touched by invitation
                            and asked his “heartfelt appreciation be expressed to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>”. He said he would
                            keep invitation strictly confidential. He then went on to say Diet would
                            still be in session during period proposed for visit, which posed
                            certain problems. While he confident budget would be passed by upper
                            house April 3 and while he did not believe there would be substantive
                            bills before Parliament requiring serious debate after end of April and
                            prior Diet adjournment May 17 or 18 he could not be reasonably sure of
                            this for another week or ten days. Also Liberal Democratic Party
                            convention would be held March 21 when he expected be elected President
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>. If party convention went well
                            and he elected President, he felt this would do much to stabilize
                            internal political situation. Therefore with these two considerations in
                            mind it would be week or ten days before he could definitely state
                            whether possible make Washington visit May 8–10.<note n="3"

                            over–all matters. He believed such discussions would do much to get
                            greater mutual understanding on common problems and thus aid in arriving
                            at constructive solutions. He had in mind meeting with me perhaps twice
                            a week, for about two hours each time, to cover wide range problems and
                            questions. He envisaged about eight or ten meetings. He felt if he were
                            going to Washington such meetings were even more necessary. He <pb

                            not be kept secret, he attached greatest importance to holding in strict
                            confidence content and substance such discussions.</p>
                        <p>I said I would welcome such discussions since in first instance I wanted
                            get his general views on situation this important part of world and also
                            on specific matters of mutual interest. I wholeheartedly shared view
                            conversations be kept confidential. I referred to comment he made that
                            relations between US and Japan were entering new phase which could be
                            very fruitful for both countries, and said I would also like have his
                            thinking about future relationship.</p>
                        <p>If we could know in more detail lines along which he was thinking re
                            general situation and specific issues, we would be in better position to
                            see what we might do to promote closer relations which we earnestly
                            desired. He said he would discuss meetings further when he gave me reply

                        <p>In the section dealing with Japan, we have the most questions about the
                            new relationship which will obtain between the subordinate Unified
                            Commander in Japan and the Ambassador and also by the position which the
                            Chief of MAAG/J will occupy. The plan as now worded authorizes the
                            Unified Commander to conduct direct negotiations with appropriate
                            representatives of the Japanese Government on certain matters. Although
                            the argument was made by Defense representatives that in context this
                            would be clearly understood to refer to dealings by United States Forces
                            with their counterparts in the Japanese military establishment, we
                            expressed the view that it would be better to state clearly that the

                                and the representatives of other agencies, and stating that
                                representatives of all agencies were subject to the supervision of a

                            the two Departments would look into the matter and decide whether to

                            of the position of MAAG/J in the new setup, Defense stated that they did
                            not have a final position on this since they were awaiting comments from

                            discussions. It was agreed that we should move ahead rapidly with this
                            study and point for May 1 as a completion date. Since we plan to
                            introduce this study as an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action,
                            higher echelon consideration may well extend beyond this date.</p>
                        <p>We pointed out that we have not discussed plans for the disestablishment
                            of <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> with the Japanese or the
                            Koreans since last July when the press release was checked out with
                            them. Defense representatives agreed that it was desirable to authorize
                            you and <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> to
                            inform the Japanese Government of progress that has been made in
                            planning for the changeover. By now you should have received
                            authorization to do this. Similar action will be taken in Korea. It was
                            agreed that instead of telling the Japanese and Koreans after the fact
                            we should have as full an exchange as possible before final decisions
                            are taken by the United States. We promised such at the time the press
                            release was discussed.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate receiving your views on the outline plan for the

                                the United States did not intend to utilize its armed forces

                                principles of revision of the security treaty of mutual agreement on
                                disposition and use of U.S. forces under the treaty, clarification
                                of the relationship between the treaty and the U.N. Charter,
                                amendment of the provision for expiration of the treaty so that it
                                would be in effect for 5 years from date of revision and terminable
                                thereafter upon 1 year’s notice by either party; and 3) a continuing
                                buildup of Japanese defense forces accompanied by withdrawal of U.S.
                                forces to the maximum possible extent, including a complete pullout

                                    target="#d124fn4">footnote 4, Document 124</ref>. On April 10,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> presented a talking
                                paper to <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> on the
                                first item of the agenda, the problems between the two countries. In
                                general, the analysis centered around reasons for the distrust of
                                and ambivalence toward the United States found in some segments of
                                Japanese opinion. The analysis stressed Japanese aversion to war,
                                U.S. military policy toward Japan, resentment against Japan’s
                                subordinate position under the security treaty, antipathy arising
                                from territorial problems, disappointment over restrictive U.S.
                                trade measures, and dissatisfaction over the embargo against the
                                People’s Republic of China. According to the paper, many Japanese
                                had come to believe that the United States ultimately wanted a war
                                aimed at overthrowing the Communist bloc powers by force. (Telegrams

                            subsequent talks may bring to light important new elements in his
                            position as whole. But security and territorial issues which he raised
                            under agenda item 2 are so basic and require such urgent attention that
                            I believe following preliminary comments should be made now.</p>

                                will be any sudden and dramatic breakdown of our relations in next
                                few months. What I do mean is that direction of the current in Japan
                                is clearly evident and if we do not try by our basic stance toward
                                fundamental issues, to direct the current into constructive
                                channels, we will find our whole position here gradually eroding
                                away in next several years. And the erosion will take place in an
                                atmosphere of acrimony <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0306"/>and
                                mounting hostility that will impair for the foreseeable future the
                                possibility of any real and dependable cooperation between Japan and
                                the US in the vital security field.</item>

                            <item><p>In <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> we have an able,
                                    very ambitious, and skilled politician. He has yet to show the
                                    quality of statesmanship, but he is determined to consolidate
                                    the “national sentiment” behind him and lead it forward.</p>
                                <p>I believe he would prefer to lead it in the direction of enduring
                                    cooperation with US. But only his future actions will tell. But
                                    I also believe he will try to lead his country in some other
                                    direction if he believes we are resorting to evasive or delaying
                                    tactics instead of coming to grips with the problem of a new
                                    relationship.</p></item>

                            <item>What <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> calls “national
                                sentiment” is really not public opinion in the Western sense but the
                                collective judgment of Jap leaders, often totally illogical from
                                Western viewpoint, which gradually crystallizes and on which
                                national policy then becomes based. In his two papers on security
                                and territorial problems he has, I believe, laid out, with unusual
                                candor, his present estimate of the basic objectives of Japanese for
                                the coming decade.</item>

                            <item>The general content of <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s proposals is not a surprise. We have seen
                                sentiment forming gradually during last two years, and in recent
                                months the press has been full of such ideas. While many of them
                                stem from Socialist or neutralist elements, many have been planted
                                in the press by members of the govt or its supporters. What is novel
                                is not the proposals but the sudden authority and completeness with
                                which they have now emerged at the highest level of the Jap Govt.
                                They call for the most searching analysis and considered response on
                                our side.</item>

                            <item>The problem we face is that the time is drawing to a close when we
                                can assume Japan is inevitably tied to the US by economic and
                                security needs. There is a strong view of neutralism in Japanese
                                “national sentiment” and <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                                could easily get the country, most Socialists included, solidly
                                behind him if he chose to lead in that direction. Japan’s membership
                                in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> means that moving away from
                                the US no longer entails ostracism from world society. Thus Jap
                                leaders will have alternatives in their own minds if they believe we
                                are unable to recognize the relationship between Japan and US has
                                undergone major change which in turn requires major
                                readjustments.</item>

                                    >Kishi</persName>’s proposals are in many respects one-sided and
                                have not yet touched upon many fundamental aspects of the future
                                relationship between Japan and the US nor upon the role that Japan
                                intends to play in the world; nor on the burdens and
                                responsibilities Japan is willing to assume in its new position in
                                terms of making its contribution to peace with justice in the world.
                                We need to draw him <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0307"/>out on
                                these and on his long-term concept of partnership between the US and
                                Japan. I would appreciate Dept’s views on questions I might put to
                                him to draw him out.</item>

                            <item>I do not believe <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> can
                                reasonably expect us to to buy his proposals out of hand, because he
                                must realize their fundamental and long-term implications, which go
                                far beyond the question of just relations between Japan and the US.
                                I also believe he is prepared to consider modifications or
                                alternatives to the proposals he has made. Talks here and in
                                Washington should explore such possibilities thoroughly, testing the
                                basis, soundness, and firmness of his position on the different
                                points. I will comment later on some of his specific
                                proposals.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>Meanwhile, I urge that <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s approach be taken with utmost seriousness and
                                that US Govt make a basic and fundamental review of our policy re
                                Japan. I believe that if as a result of Washington talks we cannot
                                lay the foundation for some fundamental readjustments looking ahead
                                to true partnership in our relations with Japan, decisions will
                                gradually be taken here which will be against our interests and
                                which we will be unable to reverse. What is required of course is to
                                put our relations with Japan as rapidly as possible on the same
                                basis of equal partnership that we have with other allies. This
                                cannot of course be done overnight nor without Japan assuming
                                responsibilities. But, if we are unable to lay solid groundwork with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> when he visits
                                Washington with constructive suggestions for achieving readjustment
                                in our relationships, I am not optimistic about the future in terms
                                of our long-term interest in Japan. My fear is that we would see
                                Japan drift progressively into neutralism. On other hand, if we can
                                give <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> sense of conviction
                                that we intend to move promptly to place relationships between Japan
                                and the US in the security and economic fields on really equal basis
                                I think we have a good prospect of identifying <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s and Japan’s interest with
                                our own, thus providing a basis for durable and dependable

                                >Kishi</persName> in his talks with you will build up unwarranted
                            expectations that conversations during visit will result acceptance
                            Japanese views.</p>
                        <p>Department now preparing individual position papers for use during visit
                            and will send you drafts for comment and suggestions. Department does
                            not however regard favorably exchange of talking papers on all points
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> agenda as this would
                            tend freeze our position especially on more controversial problems.</p>
                        <p>FYI. As Japanese apparently have already completed extensive preparation
                            for <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> talks with you,
                            difficulties our preparing timely and adequate responses and fact you
                            may also find frequency of meetings disadvantageous, suggest you may

                            1954 which presently provides the basis for our administration. The

                            This clearance was subsequently withdrawn when it was decided last
                            December to seek a thorough review of the whole administration set-up.

                                Second, from our point of view Girard case a poor one for initial

                                U.S. has primary right exercise jurisdiction and attempt to resolve
                                with Japanese. However, if, as appears likely, Japanese refuse
                                agree, you authorized to allow Girard be tried by Japanese
                                authorities. However, you should continue to maintain legal position
                                that U.S. considers its certificate of line of duty correct. If
                                necessary to permit Japanese trial you authorized to withdraw line
                                of duty certificate although still maintaining legal

                            <item>In view of possibility of Congressional interest this matter, it
                                is obviously to our interest that Japanese charge Girard for least

                                justice, and it may be possible for you to secure Japanese agreement

                        <p>2547. At Diet committee meeting yesterday, <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, modifying past stand, testified that Japanese
                            constitution does not bar possession of nuclear weapons “for defensive
                            purposes”. Press quoted <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> as
                            stating “I do not think so-called nuclear weapons are prohibited
                            entirely by constitution. In view of progress of science, we must have
                            effective power to carry out modern warfare within scope self-defense.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> however assured Diet
                            committee he had no intention of arming Self-Defense Forces with nuclear
                            weapons or reversing opposition to US stationing of nuclear units in
                            Japan. He did not on other hand express “doubt that opposition to
                            nuclear weapons will continue to apply although it is hard predict
                            future because nuclear weapons are progressing.”</p>

                            anticipated interpellations on this question since Socialists have
                            publicized their intentions to do so; Socialists had been agitated about

                                >Kishi</persName>’s statement as switch from past attitude
                            absolutely rejecting nuclear weapons. Comments also warned against

                        <p>In accordance with your instructions, I met with Acting Assistant
                            Secretary of Defense John N. Irwin on the afternoon of May 6 to
                            determine the areas of disagreement between State and Defense on the
                            Ryukyus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Irwin raised for discussion and presented a Defense position on the
                            following subjects. I countered wherever possible with a State
                            position.</p>

                                <item>Defense would like to have it promulgated as soon as possible.
                                    I explained that we would prefer to hold up promulgation until
                                    after the <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> visit as
                                    this would give us a chance to talk to Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and explain our position
                                    in the Ryukyus as a part of our overall military position in the
                                    Pacific.</item>

                                <item>Defense would like the promulgation to be well publicized. I
                                    explained that while we would not want to draw excessive
                                    attention to it we would agree that it should be made well known
                                    to the Ryukyuans.</item>

                                <item>Defense has agreed with our position that the Governor should
                                    reside in the Ryukyu Islands. He will be the military commander
                                    of the Ryukyu Islands Command and a lieutenant general. We
                                    agreed with Defense that it would be better to call him Governor
                                    rather than Governor General or High Commissioner. (I understand
                                    that the Budget Bureau, however, will not agree to the name
                                    Governor”.)</item>
                                <label>b.</label>
                                <item>Defense believes that the Governor should communicate with
                                    Washington through <gloss target="#t_USARPAC1">USARPAC</gloss>,
                                    Honolulu, on all matters—including civil affairs. I explained
                                    our position that we would like to see the Governor directly
                                    under the Department of Defense on civil affairs matters as this
                                    would provide for prompt and immediate consideration of civil
                                    affairs problems by Washington. We decided that we could not
                                    reach agreement on this issue. It seems apparent that Defense
                                    wishes to keep civil affairs subordinate to the military chain
                                    of command which will insure that, as has been the case in the
                                    past, immediate military considerations receive primary
                                    attention. It would, furthermore, continue to downgrade civilian
                                    matters.</item>

                                <item>Defense suggested and we agreed that as the Governor would
                                    reside in the islands there would no longer be a need for a
                                    permanent Deputy Governor and that therefore the office should
                                    be abolished. When the Governor is absent from the islands the
                                    Deputy Military Commander will act as Governor.</item>

                        <p>Defense suggested that, rather than to establish a new advisory committee
                            on Ryukyuan affairs, greater participation by the civilian agencies
                            could be obtained by perfecting the existing system of liaison. I
                            explained that we were interested in the committee only as a means of
                            guaranteeing that all phases of Ryukyuan problems be fully considered
                            when decisions are being made. We agreed that a compromise might be
                            reached by designating specific individuals or positions in the
                            interested agencies who would receive all pertinent communications and
                            be consulted on all significant developments.</p>

                                <item>Defense stated that less than 17% of the Civil Administration
                                    are military people and that the number of military personnel
                                    could hardly be reduced any farther. I explained that we are not
                                    interested in the actual number of military people in <gloss
                                        target="#t_USCAR1">USCAR</gloss> but rather in the

                                        >USCAR</gloss>—that <gloss target="#t_USCAR1">USCAR</gloss>
                                    needs to be keenly aware of civilian problems.</item>

                                <item>Defense believes that combining <gloss target="#t_USCAR1"
                                        >USCAR</gloss> and the Executive Branch of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_GRI1">GRI</gloss> would not advance the
                                    development of political responsibility and knowledge in the
                                    Ryukyuans. I explained that in our view United States interests
                                    can best be served by working toward maximum Ryukyuan
                                    participation in their own government. This will not only work
                                    toward relieving our burden of running the Islands but also
                                    instill a greater feeling of responsibility on the part of the
                                    Ryukyuans. Even more important, we need to develop a greater
                                    Ryukyuan consciousness that the Islanders are benefitting from
                                    our administration; their participation in their own government
                                    should help this.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>At the end of the discussion we decided that major disagreement existed
                            only on two of the subjects which we had discussed: the time of the
                            issuance of the Executive Order (1a) and the civil affairs channel of
                            communications for the Governor (2b). I believe it is important that we
                            hold out for our position on these two matters.</p>
                        <p>It will be far easier for the Japanese to accept the Executive Order for
                            what it is and represents—i.e., merely a statement of the existing
                            administration—and not see in it a new departure (which would revive,
                            with vigor, the Japanese clamor for reversion of the Islands) if we
                            discuss the Executive Order with them before issuance. An opportunity of
                            discussing with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and his
                            advisors our military role in the Pacific and the part that Okinawa
                            plays before the Executive Order is made public should decrease the
                            likelihood of undesirable Japanese reactions.</p>
                        <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0317"/>
                        <p>If we are to avoid a perpetuation of the present situation, which
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">John Steeves</persName> finds extremely
                            unsatisfactory, in which all civil affairs matters are screened and
                            interpreted by one or several military headquarters before they are
                            referred to Washington, we must establish the standard practice of
                            direct communication with the Department of Defense (with information
                            copies to the military headquarters concerned).</p>
                        <p>Mr. Irwin listed several other topics which he thought ought to be
                            discussed at some subsequent meeting:</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">N.S.C.</hi> Defense believes that the Ryukyus should
                            continue as just a paragraph in the Japanese paper. (I continue to feel,
                            however, that the benefit of our recent review, between Defense and
                            State, of the Ryukyuan situation should be shared with higher officials
                            of the United States Government through some mechanism.)</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Organic Act.</hi> There is general agreement that we
                            should have an Organic Act providing Congressional authority for
                            Ryukyuan administration but disagreement as to the contents.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Economic Planning.</hi> State and Defense agree that
                            planning is essential. There are differences, however, in methods.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Wages.</hi></p>

                        <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Currency.</hi> State and Defense agree that
                            something must be done about the present currency which is an occupation
                            fiat currency. Defense wants to replace it with United States dollars.
                            We would like to back the existing currency with dollars or replace it
                            with a new Ryukyuan currency backed with dollars.</p>
                        <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Foreign Representation.</hi> Defense is not happy
                            about our sharing representation functions for Ryukyuans abroad with the
                            Japanese.</p>

                        <p>Following an exchange of amenities, General Moore stated that he would
                            like to comment on present conditions in the Ryukyu Islands. He said
                            that the United States administration of the Ryukyus was being impeded
                            by the fact that there was no basic law and no basis for appropriations
                            since the issuance of the Executive Order had been repeatedly delayed in
                            view of various developments which indicated that the time was not
                            propitious for the issuance of this order. [<hi rend="italic">15½ lines
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] General Moore stated that we
                            should bear in mind that another Cyprus-type situation was possible in
                            the Ryukyus and might have developed last summer had it not been for the
                            rather placid Ryukyuan temperament.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> stated that he would
                            like to make one thing clear—that there was no difference in opinion
                            between the Departments of State and Defense on our basic policies in
                            the Ryukyus. The islands are strategically essential and the United
                            States will remain there as long as necessary. To maintain our present
                            position was also in the interests of the Japanese and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> had been
                            instructed to inform Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> that we have no intention to return the islands to
                            Japan in the foreseeable future. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Robertson</persName> stated that the question of timing of the
                            promulgation of the Executive Order was not a matter of black and white.
                            Both <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> had
                            presented good cases for their respective positions favoring prompt
                            promulgation and delay until after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s visit. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Robertson</persName> stated that we must recognize that the timing
                            of promulgation was of great concern to the Japanese Government and said
                            that he favored informing the Prime Minister of the content of the
                            Executive Order and requesting his views with regard to promulgation
                            prior to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s visit.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> should
                            also indicate to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> at that time that our position in the Ryukyus was
                            not negotiable in order to make it clear to the Japanese that we would
                            not cave in when confronted with persistent pressures. General Moore
                            expressed agreement with this point of view.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> stated that while the
                            Department of State favored a continuation of military government in the
                            Ryukyus, political problems in Japanese-American relations which were
                            raised by our presence in the islands were of extreme importance. It is
                            essential that problems arising from United States administration of the
                            Ryukyus be the subject of close coordination between the Departments of
                            State <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0319"/>and Defense. These
                            problems should be considered in Washington, rather than in Honolulu, to
                            insure adequate consideration at the highest levels of Government.
                            General Moore expressed agreement noting that the channel of
                            communications should be so organized to insure that Ryukyuan problems
                            would receive most effective consideration regardless of personalities
                            involved. Civil affairs problems arising in Okinawa were principally the
                            concern of Washington agencies. It was, of course, essential to keep
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> fully informed of
                            developments in the islands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Irwin said he thought it would be advisable for Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> when seeking Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s views on the timing of
                            the promulgation of the Executive Order, to indicate to him at that time
                            that the United States position on the land and education problems in
                            the Ryukyus was not negotiable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Parsons</persName> stated that they thought it would be
                            better to limit the <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            discussion to the Executive Order to avoid delay. Mr.
                                <persName>Parsons</persName> stated that it was important to
                            communicate with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> as soon as possible in view of Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s plans to visit
                            Southeast Asia in the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said that he felt
                            strongly that there should be a separate National Security Council paper
                            on the Ryukyu Islands. This area was now much too important to be
                            treated only as a paragraph in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            paper on Japan. Mr. <persName>Parsons</persName> said that a separate
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper would enable the high
                            officials in the United States Government to benefit from the recent
                            State and Defense review of the Ryukyuan situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Irwin stated that the Department of Defense preferred treating the
                            Ryukyus in the Japan paper. Defense would be pleased to review this
                            position but it might be felt that a separate paper was not
                            required.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> replied that the
                            persons ultimately responsible for decisions regarding the Ryukyus
                            should not be deprived of knowledge essential to the formulation of such
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>The meeting terminated with general agreement that State and Defense
                            should urgently review the Executive Order in order that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> could inform
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> of its
                            contents, stressing that the United States position on the Ryukyus was
                            not subject to negotiation. At the same time. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> could obtain the Prime
                            Minister’s reactions as to the timing of the promulgation.</p>

                                <persName>William S. Girard</persName>, who is accused of the fatal

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Facts</hi> (Japanese and United States authorities in
                            general agreement as to these facts.) On the afternoon of January 30,
                            1957, about thirty members of Girard’s company were engaged in a small
                            unit exercise at Camp Weir range area (called the Somagahara maneuver
                            area by the Japanese) in central Japan. About twenty-five Japanese,

                            unit during the course of the morning exercises and had interfered to
                            such an extent that ball ammunition was withdrawn from the troops.</p>
                        <p>During a short recess, Girard and another soldier were ordered by their
                            platoon leader, a lieutenant, to guard a machine gun and some items of
                            personal clothing in the maneuver area. Girard had a grenade launcher on
                            his rifle. After arriving at the gun position, Girard picked up and
                            threw expended cartridge cases in the direction of the Japanese
                            “brass-pickers” and beckoned for two of them, a man and a woman, to come
                            to gather these empty cartridge cases. After they had drawn near, Girard
                            suddenly shouted to the man and woman to leave, and placing an expended
                            cartridge case in the grenade launcher attached to his rifle, fired at
                            the man. He then placed another expended cartridge case in his grenade
                            launcher and fired at the woman, striking her in the back. An autopsy
                            disclosed that the expended cartridge case penetrated her back to a
                            depth of three to four inches, causing her death (Tab A).<note n="2"

                        <p>Paragraph 3 of Article XVII states that the military authorities of the
                            United States shall have the primary right to exercise jurisdiction over
                            members of the United States armed forces or the civilian component in
                            relation to “offenses arising out of any act or mission done in the
                            performance of official duty”. The question of jurisdiction in the
                            Girard case turns on the issue of whether Girard’s actions vis-à-vis the
                            “brass-pickers” were a deviation from the course of duty.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">United States Position</hi>. The United States military
                            authorities in Japan concerned with this case contend that Girard was
                            ordered to guard the gun position and that the shooting incident arose
                            in the performance of official duty.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Japanese Position</hi>. Japanese authorities admit that
                            Girard was on duty but contend that the shooting had no connection with
                            his duty of guarding the machine gun. They assert that the act of Girard
                            in throwing out the expended cartridge cases and enticing the Japanese
                            woman toward him had no connection with guarding the machine gun. They
                            accept Girard’s contention that he had no intention to shoot the
                            Japanese woman and have expressed the belief that Girard acted only in a
                            mischievous manner, perhaps “intending to have fun in a child-like
                            way”.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Present Status of Case</hi>. The Socialist opposition
                            in Japan contended that this was a wanton and intentional act and
                            succeeded in arousing considerable public indignation. In view of the
                            differences between the American and Japanese sides as to whether the
                            offense with which Girard is charged arose out of an act done in the
                            performance of official duty, the Joint Committee, as provided in the
                            Administrative Agreement, referred this question to a joint
                            Japanese-American Criminal Jurisdiction Subcommittee, which began its
                            consideration of the issue on March 12. By the end of April it was
                            obvious that neither side would change its position. The Department of
                            the Army thereupon informed <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>
                            that it believed that resort to diplomatic channels, as required by
                            Article XXVI of the Administrative Agreement, in cases where agreement
                            cannot be reached in the Joint Committee would be “unproductive and
                            unwise,” and instructed <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> to
                            resolve the matter in the Joint Committee, authorizing the Command “to
                            allow Girard to be tried by Japanese authorities,” if necessary (Tab

                            the Joint Committee the question of whether the act was in performance
                            of official duty would have to be decided by the Japanese courts. It did
                            not desire to have the question decided by these courts. The Girard case
                            was also felt to be a poor one for initial judicial determination (Tab
                            D).</p>
                        <p>In view of the desirability of trying Girard for the alleged offense as
                            quickly as possible and in view of the impasse on the question of
                            Japanese or American jurisdiction, a compromise was reached in which the
                            United States decided not to exercise jurisdiction in the Girard case.
                            This was done without prejudice to the United States position that the
                            alleged offense of Girard arose in the performance of official duty. As
                            part of this compromise a confidential arrangement was concluded in
                            accordance with which Japan agreed to indict Girard on no greater charge
                            than wounding resulting in death, under Article 205 of the Japanese
                            Penal Code, for which the penalty is two to fifteen years. This is the
                            least serious offense for which it is reasonable to indict Girard under
                            Japanese law. Japan also agreed to recommend, through Japanese
                            procuratorial channels, that the Japanese court mitigate the sentence to
                            the maximum practicable extent, considering the circumstances of the
                            case (Tab E).<note n="6" xml:id="d137fn6">Tab E is <gloss

                            would be accepted. I emphasized however that I did not believe there was
                            possibility cancelling issuance.</p>
                        <p>In reply <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> stated he sincerely
                            hoped Executive order would not have to be issued at all but if no
                            possibility of avoiding issuance, he felt it better have it issued prior
                            to his trip to Washington. In his opinion if issuance delayed until
                            after his return, repercussions within Japan would be even greater. It
                            would look as if he had been consulted in Washington and had agreed to
                            issuance. He regretted however that US felt obliged to replace existing
                            arrangements with Executive order. Fact that Executive order was signed
                            by President would attract much attention.</p>
                        <p>I said to <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> that I felt he
                            should think about timing of issuance of Executive order not just in
                            light of immediate situation but long term future relationships between
                            Japan and US. With this in mind did he feel effect on our relations,
                            which he had said he desired to do everything to strengthen, would be
                            better by issuing order now rather than following his visit, for example
                            later in July? <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> reflected and
                            said again that he regretted issuance of order but if we had to issue
                            it, it preferable to do so before his visit.</p>
                        <p>He was particularly disturbed by wording of first sentence of preamble.
                            He had in mind that this would be interpreted throughout Japan that it
                            was a permanent and new arrangement for Ryukyus. If we had to issue
                            Executive order, and he still hoped we could find some way to avoid
                            doing so, he hoped very much first sentence of preamble would simply
                            make reference to Article 3 of peace treaty with no elaborations or
                                trimmings.<note n="3" xml:id="d138fn3">The summary given <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> by <persName

                                summary transmitted in telegram 2532 to Tokyo, May 16. As
                                telegraphed, the summary of the preamble reads: “Pending
                                establishment enduring conditions peace and stability Far East it is
                                policy US maintain degree of control and authority now exercised

                                mindful importance human rights, dignity of human person and
                                striving peoples everywhere govern themselves accordance democratic
                                concepts.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 794C.0221/5–1657)</note>
                            He added that while he recognized that substance in first sentence of
                            preamble had been used previously by US, in light of present
                            circumstances he felt very strongly it would [<hi rend="italic"
                                >should</hi>?] be changed to prevent general impression of
                            permanency in arrangements which would be widespread throughout Japan. I
                            said I would of course report his views to Washington but I understood
                            we were obliged to issue Executive order.</p>
                        <p>My estimate is <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> believes
                            tremendous hue and cry will break out in Japan when Executive order is
                            issued and therefore wishes to disassociate himself from it. By giving
                            me copy of his statement opposing issuance of Executive order he has
                            placed himself on record that he is against it. I think he understands
                            we must issue order but my own <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0326"
                            />strong recommendation is that because of timing in relation to
                            forthcoming <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> visit we try to
                            find some simple formula for preamble which simply makes reference to
                            Article 3 of treaty. I am not informed by Department as to what
                            publicity is going to be given to issuance of Executive order, how we
                            intend to play it, or when it will be issued. Certainly anything we can
                            do to slide it through with minimum publicity and make it appear routine
                            thing, perhaps related to change of governorship and need for putting
                            onto one piece of paper the related existing administrative
                            arrangements, will be very important. Would appreciate being kept
                            urgently informed re plans for issuance, publicity, and whether anything
                            can be done re preamble.</p>

                        <p>The Sec referred to the fellow being turned over to the Japanese court
                            and said there is a good deal of evidence to suggest Defense is trying
                            to place the responsibility on State. S heard that on the radio from
                            Japan. The Sec said the people here say the same thing and the Sec does
                            not think the facts justify it and we don’t want a public controversy
                            about it. There are Congressional inquiries. The Sec said S might check
                            on what is going on. S talked with the Army and said to say nothing
                            until <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> gets the report
                            back. It is a delicate thing and S hopes we can get agreed facts. S
                            thinks anybody in State who observed should sit down with the Defense
                            counterparts and clear up that end. There are no papers to indicate
                            State advised in any way. We have been getting it verbally, said S. The
                            Sec said something re the decision being made in Defense in the
                            Pentagon. S said no—the decision to relinquish jurisdiction was made by
                            the Joint Comm on the basis of a message sent by the Army to the Judge
                            Advocate General giving him authority but what part anyone else

                        <p>[Here follows discussion of unrelated matters.]</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Girard Case</hi>—Sec. <persName corresp="#p_BWM1"
                                >Brucker</persName> recounted at length the facts and conflicting
                            stories of this incident. The Leaders were primarily interested in why
                            Girard had been turned over to the Japanese for trial. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> explained that under our treaty
                            with the Japanese, a soldier’s commanding officer certified if he was on
                            official duty when something goes wrong. Generally this is sufficient,
                            but in the Girard case, the Japanese exercised their treaty right to
                            dispute the certificate and have the matter referred to a two man
                            Commission (one Japanese, one American). If they disagree, it continues
                            at stalemate until some sort of agreement is reached. In this instance,
                            the two parties disagreed at first. Experts within the Defense
                            Department also disagreed as to what our position should be. As a result
                            of disagreements among our legal experts both in Washington and in
                            Japan, the matter was referred back to the <persName>Admiral</persName>
                            who was our member on the commission, the decision being left with him.
                            He then agreed to Japanese exercise of jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> said he believed the
                            United States should retain jurisdiction and bring Girard before a court
                            martial. Accordingly, he intended to clear with State Department, then
                            send out a cable<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">See <ref target="#d147fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 147</ref>.</note> directing that we vacate
                            our earlier action and that we assert our jurisidiction and bring Girard
                            to military trial. The cable would go to Gen. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>. The Japanese, however,
                            would be able to press their point of view under the treaty, and the
                            Joint Commission would have to listen to the argumentation.</p>

                        <p>B returned the call and the Sec said on the Japanese thing he hopes B
                            realizes he is playing for pretty big stakes and the Sec does not know
                            that the whole future of our relations with Japan ought to be determined
                            in response to newspaper furor and B agreed. B is sure it will not get
                            off the track. The Sec wants to be sure they are living up to their
                            rights. B said it states it is without prejudice to their rights and
                            they can go ahead under the treaty. B feels it gets it back on the
                            tracks where it belongs and feels it is less difficult. B said they are
                            planning to put it back to the status quo ante where we will begin court
                            martial proceedings and the notification we would yield is to be vacated
                            without prejudice under the rights of the treaty and have them take
                            regular course under the treaty. There was an abortive attempt by these
                            people which involved trial and sentence and it was made off the record
                            and secret which is against anything in the treaty and that <pb n="303"
                                xml:id="pg_303" facs="0331"/>cannot stand. We have to go one way or
                            another. The Sec said he has not gone into the facts but wants to be
                            sure B is punctiliously living up to the agreement because if B does not
                            our whole relationship with Japan may be in jeopardy and it is pretty
                            important. B agrees and will say in the cable<note n="2"

                                    147</ref>.</note> this shall be without prejudice. It does not
                            deprive the US or Japan of any rights. The Sec repeated about being
                            careful as the relationship is precarious and it is vital to our
                            security interests there and it is up to B’s people to live up to
                            agreements. B thinks it does and has gone over it with the legal and
                            policy people. The Sec said there is a provision for referral to the
                            Joint Comm. B said yes and we say that and if can’t agree then to the
                            two govts and if they can’t agree Japan has the right in their own court
                            to make the determination and we have the right to make a presentation
                            and we reserve, etc. The Sec mentioned had they considered reversing the
                            decision of the Joint C and B said yes. B would be happy to talk with
                            the Sec anytime about this.</p>

                            facts B believes a mistake was made in the Joint Comm and it is not
                            possible to agree to Japanese jurisdiction and consequently it should be
                            dealt with through govtal channels which the treaty provides. B thought
                            it best not to go into the treaty except to say it is without prejudice.

                                    with Article 26 of administrative agreement.”</p></note></p>
                        <p>I fear that having once accepted the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee
                            and having agreed to Japanese jurisdiction, all in accordance with the
                            Administrative Agreement, an attempt now abruptly and unilaterally to
                            reverse our position would be understandably judged by the Japanese to
                            be a repudiation of our international agreement with them. The
                            consequences of this could profoundly and adversely affect our position
                            in Japan, our relations with Japan and our whole position in the Far
                            East.</p>
                        <p>Can there not be any more careful study of whether and how the United
                            States can extricate itself from the present position without serious
                            damage to our national security interests?</p>

                            Embassy Tokyo a) to consult the Japanese government and to state our
                            desire to withdraw notification of permission for the Japanese to try
                            Girard without prejudicing the question of jurisdiction, and to discuss
                            the matter at the diplomatic level, b) to inquire whether the Japanese
                            would find it beneficial if a U.S. court martial of Girard were to be
                            initiated immediately and proceed concurrently with the diplomatic

                        <p>After considerable and involved discussion of the legal points, it was
                            agreed by all that in the event of disagreement in the Joint Committee
                            the problem was to be taken up by the two governments; that an earlier
                            interpretation of the agreement was incorrect which suggested that the
                            ultimate decision, if there was disagreement in the Joint Committee,
                            would lie in the Japanese courts.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out that the Japanese had now issued a notice of
                            indictment, set a date of June 21 for the trial, and appointed judges
                            and that in so doing they were acting in complete good faith pursuant to
                            the secret arrangement made when the Joint Committee had been <pb
                                n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0336"/>unable to agree. <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> had asked urgently for
                            instructions as to whether Girard should be sent to arraignment. The
                            Secretary at the outset had pointed out that he felt that the matter
                            should be put into diplomatic channels as soon as possible and have
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> explain to
                            the Japanese the depth of feeling involved, hoping that he could prevail
                            upon the Japanese to agree to reconvening the Joint Committee to
                            reconsider the case. The Secretary speculated on the possible
                            consequences if the Japanese should proceed to try Girard in absentia
                            and sentence him and at the same time our Military would carry out a
                            court martial, sentence him and inflict the penalty. In the end, after
                            discussion of various aspects of this possible course, the Secretary
                            felt that we should check with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> for his views on at least the possibility of
                            having a court martial undertaken immediately. In this connection,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> felt that a court
                            martial might take as little as 15 days although it could take
                            considerably longer, especially with the full right of appeal.</p>
                        <p>In considering the desirability of Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> taking up immediately with
                            the Japanese government the possibility of reconvening the Joint
                            Committee, the Secretary discussed a number of related facets. He
                            pointed out that it was quite important that we take no step which would
                            disparage the secret arrangement which had been made to avoid the Joint
                            Committee impasse, as such practical solutions are frequently most
                            advantageous. The timing of the approach to the Japanese and any court
                            martial was considered in relation to the impending <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> visit. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> pointed out the pressure from
                            Congress on this matter to which the Secretary pointed out that the
                            principal concern of Congress was that we not unduly turn over Girard to
                            Japanese jurisdiction which by the present course of action we were not,
                            at least for the time being, doing. The Secretary felt that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> could discuss
                            fairly frankly with the Japanese that the position we had taken in the
                            Joint Committee was ill-advised; that neither side would want to
                            consider the actions of the Joint Committee irrevocable; that in any
                            event we could not consider the decision irrevocable until we had acted
                            by turning over the body to the Japanese courts; that raising it at the
                            government-to-government level and putting it back into the Joint
                            Committee did not in any way prejudge the question of jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> agreed to the
                            course of action in taking the matter to the Japanese and to instructing
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> not to turn over Girard
                            for the time being. He agreed that he should not send out the telegram
                            he had drafted and read to the Secretary. It was understood that court
                            martial proceedings would not be instituted until we had heard from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>.</p>

                            Foreign Minister) this afternoon and, after describing intense public
                            and Congressional reaction and very serious implications of case on long
                            term relations of two countries, I said I was instructed express our
                            desire to withdraw notification resulting from agreement in Joint
                            Committee and to propose instead that settlement be sought through
                            diplomatic channels. I urged that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            not proceed further with judicial procedures in connection with proposed
                            trial while discussions between two governments in process. I expressed
                            appreciation of importance of problem to both governments but urged that
                            it be settled in way which would prevent lasting damage, and compromise
                            many of common objectives two governments were now seeking.</p>
                        <p>Ishii responded he was informed of repercussions in US but trusted that
                            political importance of question in Japan likewise understood. Proposal
                            would have very serious political repercussions particularly since
                            Japanese thought it had been disposed of in Joint Committee which had
                            reached decision only after long and careful discussion and
                            consideration on both sides. He said Japanese felt Joint Committee
                            decision had had ample justification. He said he could not give response
                            now because of gravity of matter but said our proposal would be

                        <p>Ishii asked whether Washington had been kept fully informed of both sides
                            of the case. He said he asked this because press accounts in US seemed
                            to be distorted and one-sided and showed no awareness of what had
                            actually happened. I said I understood <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                >FEC</gloss> had been reporting main developments to Washington but
                            that I would check.</p>
                        <p>As to press interest in our talk, it was agreed that we would say I had
                            made courtesy call on newly appointed acting Foreign Minister and
                            discussed one or two points in connection with <persName

                        <p>I did not make reference to possibility of immediate court-martial
                            procedure. Neither <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> with whom we

                                revocable until the individual was turned over for trial, stated:
                                “Army desires proceed immediately with court martial in accordance
                                with their prerogative. Inquire whether Japanese would find it
                                useful for United States to proceed immediately with court martial
                                while governmental discussions in process. Possibility exists that
                                United States court martial under which minimum sentence would be
                                three years might prove satisfactory to Japanese in this
                                case.”</note>
                            <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0338"/>since at present stage of case,
                            for US to proceed with court martial would apparently be clear
                            contravention of Administrative Agreement and supporting documents.
                            Another important reason was that such a proposal put forward at this
                            time would, I feel sure, seem to Japanese to be entirely inconsistent
                            with notion of settling question of jurisdiction through diplomatic
                            channels, particularly when we ask them to take no further judicial
                            steps while discussions between two governments in process. I should
                            note that at this particular juncture sentence by US court-martial, even
                            if possible under applicable agreements, would in our opinion have no
                            effect on Japanese desire exercise jurisdiction this case.</p>

                            we do not maintain important security installations. In support of his
                            recommendation he points out the inconsistency of refusing to permit the
                            return of a small number of Bonin Islanders for security reasons when
                            there is a large local population in the Ryukyus where we have much more
                            important military installations. He also notes that allowing only those
                            of Caucasian ancestry to return leads to charges of racial
                            discrimination.</p>

                        <p>Our policy of keeping a relatively small number of Japanese out of the
                            only potentially strategic Bonins for security reasons, when we allow
                            800,000 “Japanese nationals” in the Ryukyus where we have large and
                            important military installations, seems capricious to the Japanese and
                            tends to undermine their confidence in our intentions and pronouncements
                            concerning the Ryukyus. Moreover, the exclusion of “Japanese” where
                            “Caucasians” have been admitted is reminiscent of our former Oriental
                            exclusion policy and arouses intense resentment.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> is committed
                            to readjust relations with the United States, and both political parties
                            have great expectations of the Washington visit. In my judgment we must
                            somehow accommodate the reviving Japanese nationalism with respect to
                            which the Bonins have become an important symbol. To make our Ryukyu and
                            Bonin policies consistent and to remove causes of resentment by
                            permitting the repatriation of some of the former inhabitants is, I
                            believe, worth considering, and I concur with Ambassador <persName

                                claims to the Bonin Islands. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                    >Dulles</persName> has enunciated Japan’s residual or ultimate
                                sovereignty over the islands and United States official statements
                                have implied that the islands would eventually return to Japanese
                                jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>Burgeoning nationalism has helped convince the Japanese that the time
                                has come for the United States to take definite steps in the
                                direction of reversion of control to Japan. This feeling is made all
                                the more potent by the presence in Japan of some 7,000 former Bonin
                                Islands residents who were removed to Japan during and at the end of
                                World War II. The refusal of the United States to permit their
                                return contrasts with the presence on the islands of about 175 mixed
                                bloods (descendants of early Caucasian settlers) whom the US Navy
                                permitted to return shortly after the war. Many of these people have
                                been absorbed into the Japanese economy and are living in conditions
                                of poverty which require that they be given public assistance. As an
                                initial step the Japanese would like to repatriate these people to
                                those portions of the islands which the United States does not
                                require for military purposes.</p>
                            <p>It is difficult to justify a policy of refusing to allow former
                                residents to return to the Bonins on grounds of security when there

                            <p>The Japanese have presented a note requesting 960 million yen as
                                compensation to former Bonin Islanders for use of their property
                                since the effective date of the Peace Treaty (April 28, 1952). The
                                United States Government does not consider the United States liable
                                to pay compensation to the islanders simply for preventing them from
                                returning to or using their property but stands ready to consider
                                any claim for compensation for property which has actually been used
                                by United States forces.</p>

                                xml:id="d151fn2"><ref target="#d149">Document 149</ref>.</note> On
                            reflection use of word “prerogative” was perhaps inexact. As I
                            understand it the case is one where the right to exercise jurisdiction
                            is concurrent and where, without any decision on the merits by the Joint
                            Committee, the United States, while claiming the primary right under
                            3(a)ii of Article 17, decided under provisions of 3(a)c not to exercise
                            jurisdiction and waived its right in favor of Japan.</p>
                        <p>However, the Defense Department considers that this waiver is revocable
                            at least so long as it holds the person in question and it is therefore
                            disposed to revoke its waiver and to claim the primary right which it
                            asserted at the joint hearing but subsequently waived. The matter would
                            then presumably revert to Joint Committee and if the Japanese then
                            disagreed with United States, then the matter would revert to the
                            Governments to settle.</p>
                        <p>However, it did seem to us that the essence of what the Japanese want and
                            are entitled to is that the person in question should in fact be
                            promptly tried and adequately punished, assuming the evidence at the
                            trial bears out the preliminary indications. This could in fact be
                            assured by a prompt court martial. This could take place without any
                            waiver by the Japanese authorities of their right. We suggest this as a
                            possible solution acceptable to Japan but leave it to your judgment
                            whether to propose it at this juncture.</p>

                                    What inflamed and infuriated Japanese was that she had been

                            Ambassador. While I recognize that only the US Govt in Washington can
                            weigh all the pertinent considerations in the Girard case and reach
                            final decision in the light thereof, I would like to give you my present
                            estimate of the situation here.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that the Japanese will not agree to giving US jurisdiction
                            as a result of the decision reached in the Joint Committee to let Girard
                            be tried by a Japanese court and our subsequent action in officially
                            notifying the Japanese authorities to this effect, which in turn led to
                            the issuance of the indictment. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            is in a position where it will not agree to our exercising jurisdiction.
                            The Japanese feel, after the full and thorough discussions in the Joint
                            Committee, that a responsible decision was taken and that there is no
                            difference with us re the merits of the Girard case. They do not believe
                            he intended to kill the woman, but do believe he was responsible for her
                            death by his actions which in their view were clearly not related to his
                            official duties.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese also resent very much implications in the American press
                            despatches that their courts do not give fair trials. I am told that the
                            record of Japanese trials is excellent and that sentences are on the
                            whole lighter than would have been given by United States courts martial
                            for similar offenses. But in addition to the question of fairness of
                            trial, I am told that of over fourteen thousand offenses since October
                            1953 in which Japanese had the right to exercise jurisdiction, they in
                            fact ceded jurisdiction to us in all but four hundred and thirty. This
                            is three percent compared to what I am told is the worldwide average in
                            similar circumstances of twenty-eight percent.</p>
                        <p>As I see it, given all circumstances and what has transpired, the only
                            alternative to upholding the original finding and agreement in the Joint
                            Committee is for us to proceed unilaterally to exercise jurisdiction.
                            This the Japanese will consider as a deliberate violation of existing
                            international agreements with us. This in turn will of course destroy
                            confidence in and the future utility of the Joint Committee. But much
                            more serious, it will, I fear, shake confidence in the United States and
                            undermine our entire position in Japan.</p>

                        <p>The Girard case has the most grave and far-reaching implications not only
                            for both Japan and the United States in terms of our vital interests in
                            and future relations with Japan but also in terms of our entire posture
                            throughout free Asia. We know for example that the Philippine Govt is

                            to Cabinet. The Pres commented he would have to leave in the middle to

                        <p>The Sec said the situation in Asia on the status of forces has gotten us
                            into a most terrible predicament. He referred to the reports from
                                Taiwan.<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">For documentation on the riots

                            is satisfied if we don’t turn this fellow over in Japan as Defense
                            originally agreed we might as well write Japan off. The Pres said true
                            and if you don’t write them off anyway—he mentioned public and
                            Congressional opinion. The Pres mentioned the thing affecting Europe
                            too. The Pres said this is not a case which should be tried by the
                            Japanese. The Sec said he doesn’t know but Defense instructed their
                            people to turn them over. The Sec referred to <pb n="317"
                                xml:id="pg_317" facs="0345"/>a provision in the agreement and this
                            was in conformity with it.<note n="3" xml:id="d154fn3">This part of the
                                conversation was reported as follows in the notes cited in <ref

                                actually this is not a case that should be turned over to Japan. It
                                was only under protest that Defense instructed their people to turn
                                him over. Secy. <persName>Dulles</persName> said no—that there is a
                                provision in the administrative agreement which says that if they
                                cannot agree, and if each side claims jurisdiction, then at the
                                request of the other, one will consider waiving jurisdiction in
                                favor of the other.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, <gloss
                                    target="#t_DDE1">DDE</gloss> Diaries)</note> The Pres said there
                            is no answer unless you get out. He knows the American army and they
                            won’t let their people be tried by anyone else. They agreed that it was
                            a mistake in agreeing to waive but they have done it. Now Japan says are
                            your agreements any good? The Sec mentioned having a talk with the Pres
                            and I gather some from Defense. The issues at stake are tremendous. It
                            is in Taiwan a question of sentence not of jurisdiction. The Pres said
                            that we have to look at the Asiatic countries and see if they should
                            stay there. If they hate us, can’t do it. The Près mentioned having the
                            talk tomorrow a.m.</p>

                                    case in which the Secretary pointed out among other things: (a)
                                    that it shows how closely people generally and foreign
                                    governments in particular pay attention to the President’s words
                                    in press conference, (b) the President was not sympathetic to
                                    turning Girard back, (c) the President and the Secretary felt
                                    that our SOF treaties were unclear and perhaps should be
                                    modified to reflect clearly that a member of the Armed Services
                                    should be tried by US court martial when committing a crime
                                    ‘when on duty’ and not ‘in performance of duty’. (Indeed, if it
                                    is in performance of duty it is not a crime.)</p>

                                    for a basic review of our policies in stationing of troops

                                    was the President’s strong feeling that prompt and radical steps

                                    aspect of the administration of the Ryukyus may involve our
                                    foreign relations and particularly, United States-Japanese
                                    relations. It will be necessary, therefore, in dealing with the
                                    Ryukyus to weigh continually our actions in the light of
                                    possible reaction upon the United States position, not only in
                                    Japan but throughout the Far East as a whole. Accordingly, it is
                                    of great importance to the overall security of the United States
                                    that the closest coordination be maintained between the
                                    Secretaries of State and of Defense regarding the administration

                                    chief objective in the Ryukyus; namely, retaining full control.

                                    Japanese public reaction to the promulgation of the Executive

                                    <p>The Order as it stands provides a facade of democracy and
                                        self-government for the Ryukyuans which, upon closer
                                        examination, becomes a chimera. If the Ryukyuans are to
                                        develop a democratic form of Government, they must be
                                        allowed sufficient leeway in which to experiment, develop
                                        and, as is unavoidable, make mistakes. The system proposed
                                        under the Executive Order has the built-in temptation to
                                        substitute our judgment for Ryukyuan judgment at every
                                        point. To achieve our fundamental purposes it appears highly
                                        desirable that intervention take place only when essential
                                        to avoid those consequences related to matters concerning
                                        United States security interests.</p></item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it is likely that the Executive Order may come under attack
                            in Japan on the ground that it is a hypocritical document which pretends
                            to give democratic rights to the Ryukyuans, but in fact does not. Such
                            assertions by the Japanese may well give rise to serious unrest among
                            the Ryukyuans. Therefore, a series of changes are proposed in the draft
                            Executive Order which determine the respective powers of the Ryukyuan
                            Governmental system and of the Civil Administration more precisely than
                            the proposed draft Order. It is recognized that a precise delimitation
                            is not possible and probably not desirable.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said he wanted to change the statement on the Girard
                                case<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">Not found in Department of State
                                files.</note> before it went over to the President. The Sec. said he
                            thought there was a minute (an agreed one) which specifically
                            contemplated this waiver procedure—a clause which specifically said that
                            in the event there was no agreement each side would sympathetically
                            consider the request of the other toward waiving jurisdiction. The Sec.
                            said that the cable<note n="3" xml:id="d157fn3">Reference
                                uncertain.</note> said that we had agreed to waive our jurisdiction.
                            This referred to Article XVII of the Administrative Agreement. The Sec.
                            said his impression was that we quite often made these arrangements one
                            way or another which facilitates practical working of these
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>The Sec. said the Defense people are claiming that because there was this
                            understanding that that vitiated the whole arrangement. The Sec. said
                            the point was that you were looking at this thing from the standpoint of
                            the rights of an American citizen. The person has a right to be tried
                            and to defend himself as best he can and not to be subjected to some
                            kind of railroading process which has been worked out in advance. He is
                            entitled, if he wants to stand on the merits of the case—if he is guilty
                            or not guilty he pays the penalty. No one has a right to make a side
                            deal. It was a side deal of some kind made with the Japanese that they
                            would not indict him for murder. The Sec. said the memorandum<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d157fn4">Apparent reference to the statement mentioned in
                                the first sentence.</note> suggests that a side deal was made. The
                            Sec. said he would like to talk to Col. <persName corresp="#p_RJM1"
                                >Raymond</persName> about this point and <persName corresp="#p_CR1"

                            said the President had stated he did not really need the memorandum. The
                            Pres. said he had come to the conclusion that we ought to turn this
                            fellow back. He was very anxious to have it done so the people on the
                            Hill would not think this was an individual case and that the proper
                            interpretation of the Administrative Agreement did not require our
                            turning over people. It would not happen again. We wanted to prevent a
                            stream of criticism on the Status of Forces Agreement. The Sec. said he
                            thought it could be explained that it was handled at a low level. A
                            mistake was made and we would have to live with it. The Pres. had
                            authorized the Sec. to tell <persName corresp="#p_BWM1"
                                >Brucker</persName> our thinking. The Sec. said if <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWM1">Brucker</persName> wanted to appeal to the
                            President we would join him in that. The Pres. said he would try to set

                            although Monday was pretty well jammed up.</p>
                        <p>The Sec. asked how <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName>
                            thought it should be handled. Should it be taken up with <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> to see how he thinks
                            we should handle it. The Pres. is persuaded that we have no recourse but
                            to have Japanese have jurisdiction in this case. It is not to be
                            understood as setting a precedent—turning people over where there are
                            accidents or misdeeds when the person is actually on duty.</p>
                        <p>The Sec. asked <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> to call
                            him after his talk with <persName corresp="#p_SMD1"

                            reported his conversation. The [Secretary?] asked if he had passed on
                            the President’s views.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>There has been serious criticism in the Congress and in the public press
                            with respect to the announced intention of Japan to try an American
                            service man, Specialist 3/c William S. Girard, for shooting and killing
                            a Japanese woman. The fact is that the Japanese Government indicted Mr.
                            Girard only after the question as to who should try him had been
                            resolved in the Joint Committee (established under the Administrative
                            Agreement with Japan) by the statement of the United States that it had
                            decided not to exercise jurisdiction. This statement was made under
                            authority received from the Department of the Army. The only issue now
                            is whether, having arrived at an agreement with the Japanese through the
                            machinery provided by the Administrative Agreement, the waiver by the
                            United States of the exercise of its jurisdiction should be revoked.</p>
                        <p>The significant facts as reported by the United States military
                            authorities are as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>About thirty members of Girard’s company were engaged in a small
                                    unit exercise at the Camp Weir range area in central Japan.
                                    About twenty-five Japanese, engaged in salvaging expended
                                    cartridge cases, had been following the unit exercises and had
                                    interfered to such an extent that all ball ammunition had been
                                    withdrawn from the troops.</p>
                                <p>During a short recess, Girard and another soldier, Nickel, were
                                    ordered to guard a machine gun in the maneuver area. A Japanese
                                    witness says that Girard threw empty cartridge cases on the
                                    ground and indicated that it was all right to pick these up, and
                                    thus enticed him and the deceased woman to come forward to get
                                    the cases. Nickel admits to throwing out empty cartridge cases
                                    at the direction of Girard, but Girard denies that he (Girard)
                                    threw any cases. After the Japanese man and woman had drawn near
                                    and were picking up the cartridge cases, Girard suddenly shouted
                                    for them to get out, and thereupon fired one shot in the
                                    direction of the man. As the woman was running away, Girard,
                                    holding his rifle at the waist, fired a second shot at her at a
                                    distance of about eight to ten meters. Girard states that he
                                    fired from the waist over the woman’s head and did not intend to
                                        <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0352"/>hit or wound her
                                    but only to scare her away. An autopsy disclosed that an
                                    expended 30-caliber cartridge case had penetrated her back to a
                                    depth of three to four inches, causing her death.</p>
                                <p>United States military authorities further report that the
                                    witnesses have “gradually changed their testimony so that it now
                                    substantially corroborates the Japanese version” except that
                                    Girard does not admit throwing brass on the ground. A lie
                                    detector test indicates that Girard is lying about this point
                                    and not aiming at the victim.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The case was handled in accordance with procedures provided for in the
                            Administrative Agreement. Article XVII of the Administrative Agreement
                            provides in paragraph 3 that in cases where both parties have
                            jurisdiction (as in the present case), the United States shall have the
                            primary right to exercise jurisdiction in relation to “offenses arising
                            out of any act or omission done in the performance of official duty”.
                            This is a more limited situation than “while on duty”. It is the same
                            language found in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Status of
                            Forces Agreement and in other agreements which we have throughout the
                            world. The question of jurisdiction which arose in the Girard case was
                            whether the fatal shooting was an act done in the performance of
                            official duty.</p>
                        <p>Both sides maintained that they had the right to exercise primary
                            jurisdiction. In accordance with the Administrative Agreement, the
                            matter was referred to the Joint Committee which was established under
                            that Agreement “as the means for consultation between the United States
                            and Japan on all matters requiring mutual consultation regarding the
                            implementation” of that Agreement. Neither side was willing to concede
                            that the other had the primary right to exercise jurisdiction. The
                            Administrative Agreement requires that in case of failure of the Joint
                            Committee to agree the matter shall be referred to Governments for
                            further consideration; but the Department of the Army took the position
                            that “resort to diplomatic channels would be unproductive and unwise”.
                            Accordingly, after six weeks of discussion the American representative
                            was authorized by the Department of the Army “to allow Girard to be
                            tried by the Japanese authorities”, but without prejudice to the claim
                            that we had the right to primary jurisdiction. Thereupon an arrangement
                            was worked out in the Joint Committee whereby the United States
                            representative notified the Japanese that the United States had decided
                            not to exercise jurisdiction in this case and the Japanese in turn
                            agreed, on a confidential basis, that the Japanese would indict Girard
                            for the least serious offense possible and would recommend to the
                            Japanese Court maximum mitigation of sentence under the
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The United States authorities thereupon formally notified the Japanese
                            Ministry of Justice that “In accordance with paragraph 3(c) of Article
                            XVII of the Administrative Agreement the United States has <pb n="325"
                                xml:id="pg_325" facs="0353"/>decided not to exercise jurisdiction in
                            the case” of Girard. The Japanese then indicted Girard for bodily
                            injuries resulting in death. The United States officials, however, still
                            have custody of Girard.</p>
                        <p>There are three alternatives that may now be pursued: (1) abide by the
                            agreement reached in good faith and allow the Japanese to try Girard;
                            (2) revoke the agreement and attempt to throw the matter back into the
                            Joint Committee with the possibility of appeal to Governments in case of
                            continued disagreement; and (3) try Girard by court martial without
                            either following the course already agreed upon in the Joint Committee
                            or observing the procedures established under the Administrative
                            Agreement.</p>

                            any one of the series “U.S. Position Papers” which are being developed
                            in Washington.</p>
                        <p>In terms of our vital interests, Japan occupies in Asia a position
                            similar to that of Germany in Western Europe. Just as the course that
                            Germany follows in Western Europe will vitally affect where Western
                            Europe goes, so the course that Japan chooses to follow will vitally
                            influence the road that the free nations of the Far East and Asia
                            follow. Japan has the only great industrial complex in Asia which in a
                            sense is comparable to the Ruhr-Western Europe complex. If it were ever
                            harnessed to Communist power, we would be in a desperate situation. It
                            is every bit as important to us as Germany.</p>
                        <p>So, our basic objective with respect to Japan is exactly the same
                            objective we have been facing for the past seven years with respect to
                            Germany. <hi rend="italic">This is, how to at least firmly align and, if
                                possible, to knit Japan so thoroughly into the fabric of the free
                                world nations that it will not in the next few years be easily
                                tempted to take an independent course <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326"
                                    facs="0354"/>leading either to non-alignment or neutralism (at
                                best of the Swiss-Swedish type or at worst of the Nehru brand) or
                                worst of all some form of accommodation with the Communist
                                bloc.</hi> While our fundamental objective with Japan and Germany is
                            the same, the circumstances are entirely different and the Japanese
                            problem is infinitely more complicated and difficult.</p>
                        <p>In Germany we had a country with the same basic <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName> religion, culture and
                            civilization as its European neighbors and the United States. This gave
                            us an important common denominator to start with. We were able, through
                            a number of complex but sound devices such as <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                            which you made such a great contribution, to weave Germany into a fabric
                            of free world inter-locking arrangements to an extent that will make it
                            difficult for Germany to unweave the fabric, even should the government
                            of the Federal Republic change. I do not mean that Germany will be
                            unable to break away, but its own interests in the vitally important
                            economic and security fields are now so directly enmeshed with those of
                            its European neighbors and indirectly with ours, that it can’t be done
                            easily.</p>
                        <p>In Japan we do not have the same favorable factors we had in Germany.
                            Geography is against it. There are no common ties of religion, culture,
                            philosophy or civilization with the United States, nor with some of
                            Japan’s free Asian neighbors. Because of historical experience, most of
                            Japan’s neighbors in the Far East and Southeast Asia are still deeply
                            suspicious of Japan. There are at this time none of Japan’s free Asian
                            neighbors that wish to join with Japan in either collective security or
                            regional economic organizational arrangements looking eventually to some
                            form of integration. Japan’s two closest free world neighbors are Korea
                            and Taiwan. Yet, at present, collective security arrangements with Korea
                            seem out of the question because of Korean suspicions, and Japan itself
                            would not wish to enter into a collective security arrangement with
                            Taiwan for fear of being dragged into a war which might develop because
                            of hostilities breaking out between Taiwan and Communist China. <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, for reasons which you know so
                            well, does not at this time present an opportunity for tying Japan into
                            an Asian collective security arrangement. The neutralist countries of
                            Southeast Asia are opposed to collective security arrangements, and like
                            other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Asian neighbors fear
                            Japan’s economic domination.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, as contrasted with Germany where we could use the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> umbrella and European collective
                            devices in the economic and security fields to tie Germany with the free
                            world, we do not have those possibilities here. As I see it, the task of
                            aligning a resurgent Japan—<hi rend="italic">and it is
                            resurgent</hi>—with the free world structure, if it is to be <pb n="327"
                                xml:id="pg_327" facs="0355"/>done at all, will have to be
                            accomplished primarily by United States initiative. Japan has come back
                            so quickly and so far in these last eighteen months that some former
                            Japanese attitudes are beginning to be visible again. Japan has had
                            neither the leavening influence of close association with dependable
                            free world neighbors which Germany has had nor Germany’s first hand
                            exposure to Soviet brutality. The Japanese people have in fact been
                            living largely in semi-isolation since 1941 and most are quite unaware
                            of the nature of the world in which we live.</p>
                        <p>It is against this back-drop that attitudes in Japan are beginning to
                            crystalize. As the political situation becomes consolidated we are apt
                            to see the Japanese move with unity and speed once they believe they
                            have found the pattern they wish to follow. So we must ourselves move
                            with dispatch to influence that pattern in a manner best designed to
                            align Japan with us. I cannot produce any evidence but I feel that Japan
                            may in the coming period, unless other prospects which she considers
                            more in her own self interest are devised, be instinctively tempted to
                            work toward some such objective as the Swiss-Swedish non-alignment
                            formula.</p>
                        <p>So the challenge is very great, and will require all the imagination and
                            wisdom at our disposal. In particular, Mr. Secretary, we are going to
                            have to draw heavily upon your wisdom and imagination to meet the
                            challenge we face with respect to Japan.</p>
                        <p>Alignment of Japan with the free world—and I use the word alignment
                            because I do not at the present time see any fabric that we can knit her
                            into as we did Germany—will, I believe, depend primarily on what <hi
                                rend="italic">we</hi> do in a) <hi rend="italic">the security and
                                defense field</hi> and b) what we do in the field of economic
                            cooperation. I would like first to set out some thoughts about the
                            security and defense field.</p>
                        <p>What are basically the formal ties which presently bind Japan to the free
                            world? The Peace Treaty, but primarily the Security Treaty and the
                            related Administrative Agreement. These agreements were very
                            imaginative, very sound, and were absolutely essential under the
                            conditions prevailing when they were drawn up. We could not have done
                            without them and they have served their purpose well. At the same time
                            the Security Treaty was wisely framed as a provisional arrangement,
                            looking toward the time when other dispositions would provide for the
                            maintenance of peace in this area.</p>
                        <p>Major changes have occurred during the last five years and it would be a
                            mistake to weigh those changes merely in military terms. Japan has moved
                            only moderately forward militarily, but has done brilliantly in her
                            economic recovery, and in the international political field Japan has
                            re-established relations with most countries and is in the United
                            Nations. These two developments have given rise to a strong urge for
                            Japan to act independently. And now at last her political <pb n="328"
                                xml:id="pg_328" facs="0356"/>leadership holds the prospect of
                            becoming effective, both at home and abroad. I venture to suggest that
                            the time is ripe for you to complete the great work you began, and
                            create a new security arrangement with Japan that will replace the
                            provisional treaty with a permanent one which will give scope for the
                            years of further evolution that lie ahead. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s visit affords a unique opportunity to lay the
                            ground work for such a development.</p>
                        <p>I, best of all, realize how heavy the burdens are which you are
                            shouldering and know that you cannot give as much time to this task as
                            you would wish. But if you can spare the time to reflect on the great
                            challenge which emerging conditions bring, I am sure that you, and
                            perhaps you alone, could come up with a creative solution which the
                            evolution of events requires.</p>
                        <p>Just to tempt your thoughts, I would like to sketch some ideas that
                            strike me as having possibilities.</p>
                        <p>In <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> we have at last an able
                            leader of Japan. He indicates he wants to make a bold new start with us
                            because he feels his people growing restive under the old arrangements.
                            Other things being equal, we will fare much better in the long run if we
                            can move constructively forward with him following his visit, rather
                            than awaiting for pressures to develop which may get out of hand.</p>
                        <p>He has indicated that his basic views on the world situation, the
                            Communist threat in the Far East, and Japan as a major Communist target,
                            are the same as ours. He has also told me that keeping Korea, Formosa
                            and Southeast Asia out of Communist hands are matters of vital
                            importance for Japan. He has acknowledged to me Japan’s dependence on
                            the U.S. nuclear deterrent to prevent general war. He shares our concept
                            of mobile striking forces held in readiness against aggression. He has
                            in the last week had the National Defense Council approve a defense
                            policy for Japan which frankly and publicly states its purpose “to cope
                            with aggression with recourse to the joint security system with the
                            United States of America.” I think we can do business with him but we
                            won’t really know until we sit down with him and <hi rend="italic"
                                >really explore</hi> the various possibilities and ways to make the
                            necessary readjustments in the relations between the two countries.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> has proposed modifying the
                            Security Treaty in a manner which he says is necessary if he is to swing
                            public opinion squarely behind him which in turn will enable him to win
                            elections and then revise the constitution so that Japan can play its
                            proper role in defense matters. In effect he has suggested tinkering
                            with the existing Security Treaty but his basic proposal is that the
                            disposition and use of U.S. forces be effected through mutual agreement
                            and that we place a five year limitation on its duration following which
                            it can be terminated on one year’s notice. He has not said what his
                            long-term objective is. Is it a mutual security treaty? If it is in fact
                            a mutual security treaty he <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0357"
                            />wants, wouldn’t it be better to start working toward that end now?
                            Certainly I would hate to have the job of trying to get the Senate to
                            ratify changes in the existing Treaty only to have to return shortly
                            thereafter with a new treaty. Before we can decide how best we can move
                            rapidly ahead to readjust existing arrangements we must know what kind
                            of treaty Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> wants
                            eventually.</p>
                        <p>This leads to the central problem I want to bring to your attention. If
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> says that his objective
                            is a mutal security treaty, may it not after all be possible following
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> visit to start to work
                            out a mutual defense treaty that would be not only acceptable but
                            appealing to both sides, and which you could therefore reasonably hope
                            to get through the Senate? A mutual security treaty would, of course,
                            involve modification in the existing Administrative Agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese have already in effect modified their constitution by
                            interpretation without waiting for amendment when they organized their
                            Self Defense Forces. These forces are now accepted as not violating
                            Article IX of the constitution. Why is it necessary to wait for formal
                            revision then? Might it not be possible to adopt the <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> formula for mutual defense, whereby
                            each country will act to meet aggression in the Treaty area “in
                            accordance with its constitutional processes”? Furthermore Japan has now
                            joined the United Nations which reinforces their right to individual or
                            collective self defense.</p>
                        <p>The Treaty area would have to be de-limited but it might be “the Japan
                            area”, a term already found in Article IV of the Security Treaty and in
                            Article XXIV of the Administrative Agreement. In such case we would wish
                            to have some provision, perhaps in a separate agreement, so that if we
                            become involved in hostilities elsewhere we could have a good prospect
                            of using our logistical base in Japan as we did during the Korean war.
                            There could also be the usual type of clause calling for consultation in
                            the event of any situation elsewhere affecting the security of the Japan
                            area.</p>
                        <p>If something along these lines were feasible, <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> might be tempted. In my talks with him he has
                            never supported nor opposed the concept of a mutual defense treaty. He
                            has said it “is not contemplated.” He is perhaps reluctant to propose it
                            now because of Japanese domestic political considerations, and perhaps
                            more importantly because he thinks our terms might involve Japanese
                            troops having to be deployed elsewhere in Asia or even defending the
                            U.S. continent or its territories. This would <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                            be politically possible for him. I do not think we need such a
                            commitment of this character from Japan. What we do want is a durable
                            and as dependable arrangement as is possible in the security field based
                            on the principle of equality and partnership.</p>
                        <p>Japanese security against overt aggression cannot be assured by Japan
                            alone. The latest approved Japanese national defense policy indicates
                            that Japan’s security against aggression is dependent on a <pb n="330"
                                xml:id="pg_330" facs="0358"/>joint system of security with the
                            United States. I think <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> fully
                            realizes this. What we need to do is to readjust the existing security
                            arrangements so that they are not vulnerable to the charge of being
                            “unequal” in political terms, and to get <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> then to take leadership in instilling in Japanese
                            minds the fact that such a treaty is by far their best guarantee against
                            aggression. This would serve to identify Japanese security interests
                            firmly with ours.</p>
                        <p>In any case, I hope you will take the opportunity really to smoke
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> out on whether he wants
                            a mutual defense treaty. He may not be able to commit himself to a
                            mutual security treaty during the Washington talks but we may be able to
                            get his mind started working in this direction and we could further
                            explore such a possibility in subsequent private talks through
                            diplomatic channels. At least we would know better where we stand and
                            how we can go about readjusting the existing arrangements. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> does say he wants a mutual
                            security treaty you could lay the groundwork for moving quietly ahead on
                            it during the following months, provided—and this is the main theme to
                            which I return—that you believe some such new concept is needed for the
                            new situation we face.</p>
                        <p>The other aspect of aligning Japan with us and the free world lies in the
                            economic field, which is of vital—indeed, life and death—importance to
                            Japan given the nature of its economy, which is so largely dependent on
                            external factors which it cannot control. Identification in Japanese
                            minds that their future economic viability depends on the closest
                            cooperation and alignment with the United States will more than anything
                            else serve to tie Japan to the West.</p>
                        <p>I feel we must bring to bear on this problem the best and most
                            imaginative brains we have in the United States. This is the field where
                            the Soviets and Chinese Communists are concentrating their energies. We
                            must show imagination and not be bound too strictly by past concepts,
                            because in the long term, alignment of Japanese economic interests with
                            us is more fundamental in its appeal and in the long run much more
                            dependable than any agreements we can devise in the security and defense
                            field and will serve to strengthen such agreements.</p>
                        <p>This letter is much too long, for which I apologize. But, I frankly did
                            not know how else to present some thoughts, such as they are, that I
                            have been turning over in my mind about the critically important period
                            on which we are about to enter in our relations with Japan. I will be
                            giving more thought to this whole question between now and my arrival in
                            Washington on June 10, following which I would like to talk to you and
                                <persName>Walter</persName> about all these matters.</p>

                                (Department of State, Central Files, 794.5/5–2757) The text of the
                                note is substantively identical to that of the published Japanese
                                note in the exchange of notes cited in <ref target="#d160fn4"
                                    >footnote 4</ref> below.</note> It is somewhat simplified
                            version that used previous years with exception that fact that this
                            year’s reduction is reduction from full amount $155 million specified in
                            Administrative Agreement is not clearly spelled out. Japanese have
                            strongly urged deletion of reference to overall reduction $72 million.
                            Embassy conceding point in note in order consummate negotiations but
                            fully reserving position in accompanying letter of understanding shown
                            below.</p>
                        <p>In past years there have been extensive legalistic arguments on question
                            whether in absence of agreement Japanese contribution would revert to
                            $155 million or to amount of contribution in immediately preceding year.
                            In Embassy’s opinion this is question which should be argued out when
                            issue arises, not before, provided our legal position to effect that, in
                            such contingency, amount would be $155 million, is fully protected.
                            Embassy believes language of agreement sufficiently protects our
                            position but, because issue was raised by Japanese late in process draft
                            note discussions, we propose send confidential letter with following
                            operative paragraphs: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    amount of reduction from contribution of $155,000,000 specified

                                        Case</hi>—The President told the Leaders that the best bet
                                    in this difficult case seemed to be to try to get both sides to
                                    postpone the matter till it quieted down a bit. Since all the
                                    procedures had been followed and we had agreed to Japanese
                                    jurisdiction (a mistake, the President thought) on the grounds
                                    that it was not a clearcut case, now the word of the U.S.
                                    Government was at stake should we insist on jurisdiction. It is
                                    awfully hard, he pointed out, for a great nation to turn around
                                    and say it didn’t mean what it said in the first instance. The
                                    President added that this sort of thing gave reason for pressing
                                    review of the desirability of maintaining U.S. forces in the Far
                                    East.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Legislative

                        <p>There was a rather full discussion of a number of possible lines of
                            action. A proposal to have the Attorney General review the procedures
                            that have been followed was made, but was not adopted. A suggestion that
                            the Japanese might conduct a trial in absentia, with suspension of
                            whatever sentence might result, was not considered feasible of
                            accomplishment. In the course of discussion on provisions of the Status
                            of Forces agreement which apply in the event of disagreement as to
                            whether an action occurred in “performance of an official act” different
                            individuals present cited different provisions as applicable. It was
                            pointed out, however, that in the Girard case the agreement to turn him
                            over to the Japanese was premised upon the waiver provision. The
                            position is therefore that the United States, through an official
                            representative, in effect gave a waiver of jurisdiction, and agreement
                            was reached with the Japanese representative on this basis. There was
                            discussion of the serious adverse consequences likely to ensue should
                            the United States now refuse to honor that agreement. There was
                            discussion also of adverse consequences to be expected from surrendering
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion, agreement was reached on behalf of the Defense
                            Department and the State Department that the United States should go
                            ahead with its commitment to turn over jurisdiction. Secretary <persName

                        <p>I said to Knowland that we had concluded that there was no practical
                            alternative to allowing the Japanese to go ahead and exercise
                            jurisdiction in the Girard case. I pointed out that this had already
                            been agreed to and I saw no practical way of retracting our steps
                            without throwing doubt upon the value of our agreements and raising a
                            storm which might sweep us out of all the Western Pacific. Knowland said
                            that would be “tough” but he did not indicate either approval or
                            disapproval.</p>

                            convinced, provide an excellent submarine base. Iwo Jima, which the
                            United States occupies, is not so adaptable but is an excellent air
                            base.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese had removed all civilians to the main islands long before
                            our forces captured the Bonins. They are now governed by the Navy which
                            permitted a small group of half-caste Caucasians to return. Some of
                            these have been permitted to import Japanese wives from Honshu.</p>
                        <p>The principal Navy argument against the return of the bulk of the former
                            Japanese civilians is that these islands are valuable as a fallback
                            submarine base if we lose our position in the main Japanese islands. It
                            is based on distrust of future Japanese policy. Admitting them to the
                            islands is regarded as a first step in a series of Japanese maneuvers
                            towards our eventual elimination from the islands.</p>
                        <p>This is a strategic consideration of potential importance. There is no
                            doubt that if <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> would obtain
                            agreement for the return of some of the islanders, his position would be
                            strengthened. The presence on the islands of a few hundred Japanese
                            civilians should not constitute an insuperable handicap in case of
                            all-out submarine warfare in the Pacific. They could be removed
                            elsewhere as was done by their own military forces in World War II.</p>

                            were not required to forego jurisdiction but that we had done so
                            voluntarily. He pointed out that in some 14,000 cases, the Japanese had
                            voluntarily relinquished jurisdiction in 13,642, that Japanese sentences
                            in the cases they tried and convicted were lighter than the sentences
                            meted out by our courts-martial, that Treaty procedures were followed to
                            the point where we had originally relinquished jurisdiction over Girard,
                            and that we did not wish to back out of that agreement.</p>
                        <p>Sen. Knowland referred to discussions of the preceding evening,<note

                            in the situation which confronted the Administration, that repercussions
                            must be expected, and that he hoped things could be fixed so that we
                            didn’t get into this situation again.</p>
                        <p>The President then commented on how the soldier had gone out of his way
                            to “manufacture” some ammunition—he had not been issued ammunition by
                            his commanding officer—and how things of this sort inevitably occurred
                            in any organization as big as the Army.</p>
                        <p>The President added that the administrative agreement supplementing the
                            Treaty and covering these matters had come to be much like the Status of
                            Forces treaties in Europe but was a bit more liberal than, for instance,
                            the one with the British. The Japanese had acted very splendidly under
                            this agreement, the President said.<note n="5" xml:id="d166fn5"

                        </list>
                        <p>Following the Ambassador’s presentation of his credentials, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> told him that the
                            United States Government had just issued a statement on the Girard case.
                            The Ambassador stated he was pleased that jurisdiction in the case had
                            been given the Japanese and the President said that the decision, he
                            felt, was a fair one. He said that the original press coverage of the
                            situation had not been accurate; it was not a case of a man who
                            committed a killing in performance of guard duty. The actual facts had
                            emerged upon a close investigation.</p>
                        <p>The President also commented that of over thirteen thousand offenses
                            since October 1953, in which the Japanese had the right to exercise
                            jurisdiction, they had in fact ceded jurisdiction to U.S. courts in all
                            but about four hundred, and that he felt it was proper to turn the
                            Girard case over to the Japanese courts. He stated, however, that we
                            have two primary interests—one is individual justice to the man himself,
                            and second is for the continuance of the satisfactory relations between
                            the two Governments on these matters. He further commented that legally
                            our protection of Girard had not been altered and that our interests
                            would not diminish in assuring that he receive a fair trial.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador then (he told me he would not have discussed
                            anything of substantive nature had not the President opened the
                            discussion) commented on the easing of trade restrictions with Red
                            China. He stated to the President that the decision by Great Britain had
                            put the Japanese Government in an extremely embarrassing position and
                            further stated that the Japanese Government’s primary interest was in
                            continuing their position at the side of the United States Government,
                            though an action such as the British made it difficult. The President
                            said he appreciated that and realized that there would be many times
                            there would not be an identical position taken by all of our allies. He
                            pointed out that we had not agreed with the French and British in the
                            Suez crisis but that we had stuck to the policy that we felt would be
                            just. Then he elaborated to the Ambassador that he felt that no doubt
                            France would follow suit in trading with Red China and after France,
                            possibly Italy and others. He continued that he felt it extremely <pb
                                n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0367"/>important for Japan with ninety
                            million people and an agrarian territory the size of California to trade
                            for their very survival. The President added that the Administration had
                            more or less inherited the position of the embargo on the Red Chinese
                            and he was more or less of the opinion that it was wise to trade as much
                            as possible with practically all nations. He stated he felt that one
                            could in many instances interest the people in these countries in our
                            way of life and in his opinion a corollary objective was not to allow
                            their own countries, in this instance Japan, to be honeycombed with Red
                            cells which would “fascinate the peoples of their country with another
                            way of life.” The Ambassador thanked the President for his understanding
                            position and stated that he hoped there would be as little disagreement
                            as possible in our negotiations between the two countries.</p>

                        <p>At the outset of the meeting Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he
                            felt we were at the point of having to make a “Big Bet” with respect to
                            “putting our money on” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            for the leadership in Japan. He asked me to give him my views, as a
                            result of my recent visit in Japan,<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">Nash was
                                in Japan in May as part of a tour of several Asian countries.</note>
                            as to whether or not the “bet” was a “good one.”</p>
                        <p>I told the Secretary that on the basis of the information I had received
                            from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> and
                            his Staff in Tokyo, I had the impression that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> was not only the “best bet”, but
                            the “only bet” we had in Japan for the foreseeable future, and therefore
                            we should make the “real pitch” to line him up on our side.</p>
                        <p>I went on to discuss the so-called doctrine or principle of mutuality
                            between the United States and Japan. I suggested to the Secretary that
                            during the forthcoming <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> talks
                            in Washington it might be desirable for the Secertary to enunciate the
                            principles he laid down in Berlin in February 1954, concerning the
                            status of United States forces abroad during a time short of hot war. In
                            this connection, I suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> was very much in need of a down-to-earth briefing
                            on what Japan as a vacuum, in terms of security protection, might mean
                            with respect to the Soviet threat. I said I was very much impressed <pb
                                n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0368"/>with the emphasis given by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> and his
                            Staff to the “Alice-in-Wonderland Dream World” frame of mind in which
                            the Japanese were now existing with respect to their position under the
                            Soviet threat. In this connection, I suggested that it would be highly
                            desirable to have the ablest person on our side give Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> the “ungarbled word.” Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked me for a
                            suggestion as to whom this individual might be and I replied that in my
                            view, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> was the
                            logical man. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            left it to me and Mr. Reinhardt<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">G. Frederick
                                Reinhardt, Counselor of the Department of State since March 17,
                                1957.</note> to work out arrangements for me to ascertain whether or
                            not Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> would be
                            available and willing to take on the job.</p>
                        <p>I spoke of the necessity of impressing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> with the exposed position which Japan would occupy
                            if United States forces were to be entirely withdrawn at this time,
                            leaving Japan a complete vacuum as far as military security were
                            concerned. I spoke further of the necessity of indoctrinating Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> on the strategic
                            position which Japan should occupy as a world power, and how to be a
                            world power Japan had to develop for herself a proper security force,
                            noting that even such neutral countries as Switzerland and Sweden have
                            very well developed security forces. I noted that Japan had excellent
                            potential in the way of an industrial backup (ship building, air frame,
                            electronics production) for a substantial Japanese Defense Force. I
                            stressed the importance that had been laid in my discussions with our
                            political and military people in Japan on the present gap between the
                            Japanese Military and the Japanese Civilian leaders, and the tendency of
                            shoving the activities of the former “under the rug.” I said I felt Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> should be impressed with
                            the principle of civilian control, which necessarily involves civilian
                            responsibilities. I stressed to the Secretary the emphasis put on this
                            point by <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> and
                            his assistants, and the handicap our military were under in Japan,
                            making comparatively slow progress with the Japanese military because
                            the latter were lacking the necessary backup and support from their own
                            civilian political leaders.</p>
                        <p>Related to the foregoing, I outlined the relationship of the withdrawal
                            of United States forces to the building up of Japanese forces. I
                            reiterated the necessity of indoctrinating not only Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, but other Japanese civilian and
                            military leaders on the strategic situation and the relation of modern
                            weaponry thereto. I stated, as a personal point of view, that there
                            should be no indication from the United States side of the level of
                            Japanese defense forces or the composition thereof. I stated further
                            that there should be no insistence, as there has been in the past, on
                            the amendment of the Japanese Constitution to permit the buildup of
                            their defense forces. I said I felt we should leave the constitutional
                                <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0369"/>question to them to work
                            out as they might deem best, and we would offer whatever advice they
                            might desire with respect to the most appropriate buildup of their
                            forces which we think would be useful for them to have to play the role
                            they have ahead of them. I noted the impression that the British White
                                Paper<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">Reference is to the British
                                defense program announced April 4, 1957.</note> seemed to have had a
                            considerable influence on their thinking in this regard.</p>
                        <p>With respect to phasing out of United States forces from Japan, I told
                            the Secretary that <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> had expressed the view that the Japanese would
                            be happy for us to continue to maintain the bases and facilities we have
                            in Japan because of the employment and dollar income derived therefrom.
                            I expressed some concern that the ground force facilities being turned
                            back to Japan were so fully absorbed in the civilian economy that they
                            would have no future military utility for the Japan Defense Force. I
                            compared the policy of the Air Force, as outlined to me by General Todd
                            in Honolulu, under which the Air Force is turning over air base
                            facilities to the Japanese as they are able to take them over and
                            utilize them for Japan Air Force purposes.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            intention of reviewing, in the course of his Washington talks, the
                            status of the current security agreement with Japan, I expressed the
                            view to the Secretary, that, as I saw it, it would be exceedingly
                            difficult to work out any piecemeal adjustment of the agreement under
                            present circumstances, recognizing that the agreement, as presently
                            worded, is quite one sided. I suggested that the expected proposal Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> will make to limit the
                            agreement to a five year duration could be better met by having his
                            Government work out with us a “Mutual Defense Agreement” which would
                            involve no particular deadline, and which could, in all probability, be
                            accomplished in much less than the five year period which he seems to be
                            preoccupied with. I said I felt there was great danger in tackling the
                            present security agreement on a piecemeal basis. In addition, I noted
                            that the Japanese would probably raise not only the termination
                            question, but also such points as the necessity of consultation for the
                            use of bases in Japan for operation outside of Japan, a ban on atomic
                            weapons, etc., not to mention the difficulty of going to the U.S. Senate
                            at this time for the ratification of amendments while furor is rife over
                            the Girard case.</p>
                        <p>I moved on to the question of jurisdiction over U.S. forces in Japan and
                            suggested that if the turnover of Girard to the Japanese is finally
                            accomplished, the good will engendered thereby in Japan, might well be
                            utilized by asking the Japanese to agree to present an out-on-the-table
                            formula like the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Netherlands
                            agreement. I <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0370"/>said this would
                            help us greatly in the Philippines and could further the uniformity of
                            our agreements with respect to jurisdiction for U.S. forces abroad.</p>
                        <p>I told the Secretary I had flown over the Bonins and had landed at Iwo
                            Jima and I told him that the issue of the return of the Bonin islanders
                            was one I felt could be worked out, given a little time, but it would
                            not be desirable (as I saw it) to push this issue in terms of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> visit. Okinawa, I felt,
                            had to remain in the United States’ hands in its present status for an
                            indefinite term and I felt Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> should be so advised.</p>
                        <p>Finally, with respect to the current survey, I expressed the hope that
                            the Secretary, if queried in any further press conferences, would
                            emphasize that the survey is not being carried on by any outside group,
                            but by the best informed people at State and Defense. It is a continuing
                            project and it will require some time before the survey can be
                            completed. Accordingly, it would be premature to draw inferences
                            therefrom at this time with respect to the outcome of the study.</p>

                            whether or not the United States “waived” jurisdiction in the Girard
                            case depends on whether or not he was acting in the performance of

                                    >Document 170</ref>.</note> W said he (meaning the Pres) had 60%
                            as the reduction and <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> has it
                            in the letter. The Sec did not remember. W is not clear if the Pres had
                            in mind 60% of all or just ground forces. The Sec thought he meant
                            ground forces. W thought he meant all. The Sec does not think so. W said
                            the present plan is to get more than 60% of the ground forces out. The
                            Sec said that is good. W said he may call the Sec (the Pres may call).
                            The Sec said he did not think it was a directive—he thought it was for
                            ground forces because he said the sea and air forces don’t get into so
                            much trouble. W said we have over 100,000 there at the end of last
                            year—½ is in the Air Force, 30% in Army and 20% in Navy and Marines.
                            (7,000 in Navy and 13 in <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0374"
                            />Marines). The Sec said he was surprised and maybe it was 60% of all.
                            The Sec repeated it may have been an illustration—not a directive. The
                            Sec mentioned having something firm before <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> comes. W did not know what position the Sec wanted
                            to be in. The Sec said we want to have a position which will be firm on
                            a substantial reduction in the fairly near future. That is as definite
                            as he is. The more definite and bigger the amount so much the better.
                            You may be in a position where they say don’t go so fast—they like the
                            foreign exchange.</p>
                        <p>W is going to review the fleet tomorrow and then to Quantico. He was
                            going to Canada next week and that means he would miss <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> gives every indication of
                            being the strongest Government leader to emerge in postwar Japan. During
                            his short tenure in office he has become the leader of the Conservative
                            Party. His predecessors <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0375"/>tended
                            to represent a faction or factions of that party. He has emphasized that
                            he desires the establishment of a full partnership with the United
                            States and that he is thinking in terms of long range goals rather than
                            immediate political expediency. He feels strongly that the time has come
                            to make readjustments in our present relationship in order to make our
                            relations durable.</p>
                        <p>After a period of drift, sentiment in Japan is now beginning to
                            crystallize, and we stand on the threshold of a new era in our relations
                            with Japan. The Prime Minister’s visit affords a unique opportunity to
                            influence the pattern of this new era in the critical period of the next
                            decade or more. A strong, cooperative Japan is fundamental and essential
                            to our Far Eastern position, and the road that Japan chooses to follow
                            will influence greatly the path which other free Asian nations take.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister has indicated during his conversations with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> that he will wish
                            to discuss the following major topics:</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister has emphasized that the existing United States
                            Security Treaty with Japan, principally because of its alleged unequal
                            nature, has become a major irritant in relations between our two
                            countries. Japan’s re-emergence as a sovereign nation, the technological
                            advances in the military field since the Security Treaty was signed in
                            1951, and the alteration of the military strategic concept in the last
                            half decade have altered the character of the United States-Japanese
                            relations upon which the Treaty was based. I believe that the Security
                            Treaty has fully reflected the situation in United States-Japanese
                            relations up to now. However, I feel that the time has come to take the
                            initiative in proposing a readjustment of our relations with <pb n="348"
                                xml:id="pg_348" facs="0376"/>Japan and to suggest to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> that we work toward a mutual
                            security arrangement which could, we would hope, replace the present
                            Security Treaty.</p>
                        <p>I believe, however, that this is not the time to renegotiate any of the
                            specific provisions of the present Treaty. This process requires most
                            careful study and preparation if it is not to precipitate strong
                            Japanese public and Socialist Party demands for such sweeping revisions
                            in the Treaty that our entire security relationship with Japan could be
                            placed in jeopardy. If, however, Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> concurs in the proposal that we
                            have discussions looking toward a common objective of a Mutual Security
                            Treaty or some other mutually satisfactory security arrangement, we
                            should be prepared, subsequent to his visit, to hold discussions with
                            him in Tokyo. We could lay the groundwork during the visit for such
                            later discussions with him following his return to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister has indicated that the next most important issue which
                            he wishes to discuss is the United States administration of the Ryukyu
                            and Bonin Islands. The United States cannot relinquish administrative
                            rights over these islands so long as the threat and tension in the Far
                            East continue. Fuller understanding of the military and political
                            realities of the Far East as they affect both the United States and
                            Japan should enable the Prime Minister to explain to his people the
                            military and political reasons underlying our position in the
                            Ryukyus.</p>
                        <p>Additional irritants which exist in our relations with Japan are our
                            continued inability to agree to the repatriation of some of the Bonin
                            Islanders who were removed to Japan during World War II and the laws in
                            Alabama and South Carolina designed to discriminate against the
                            importation of Japanese textiles.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the repatriation of Bonin Islanders, the Department of
                            State sees no political objection to our permitting some of the
                            Islanders to be repatriated from Japan. The Department of Defense,
                            however, holds the view that such repatriation would jeopardize our
                            security position in the Bonin Islands. The matter is currently under
                            discussion by the two Departments in the hope of devising some solution

                                laws had not been enforced, in a few instances stores had ceased

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that Japan continues to be
                                important to U.S. security interests and that Japan must be
                                prevented from coming under Communist domination. They consider that
                                U.S. <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0378"/>policy and programs
                                are, from the military point of view, adequate; these are designed
                                to prevent the Japanese Government from embracing neutralism, yet
                                provide sufficient flexibility to permit evolutionary changes in the
                                future relationship between the United States and Japan. Current
                                national policy takes cognizance of the fact that as Japanese
                                strength grows, dependence on the United States will lessen and
                                should be replaced by a new sense of common purpose, mutual
                                interests and working partnership. To this end, the U.S. objectives
                                provide for a Japan, allied to the United States, which is capable
                                and willing not only to defend herself but to contribute to the
                                security of the Pacific area. The military courses of action to
                                attain these objectives include consultation with the Japanese
                                Government to develop a long-range plan for the buildup of Japanese
                                defense forces and a phased withdrawal from Japan of U.S. forces as
                                consistent with United States and Japanese security
                                interests.</item>

                            <item>In order to achieve this military posture, the United States must
                                maintain, among other things, a forward deployment of U.S. ready
                                military forces prepared to conduct operations immediately from
                                positions strategically selected both to counter local aggression
                                and to carry out the initial tasks of a general war. This forward
                                deployment currently includes U.S. forces and bases in Japan proper,
                                in the Bonins, and in the Ryukyus. Recognizing that a strong Japan
                                is essential to the over-all U.S. position in the Far East, U.S.
                                forces there are currently contributing to the defense of
                                Japan.</item>

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that a strong Japan allied to
                                the United States would be a deterrent to a general war, and a
                                deterrent to military conflict short of general war. However,
                                Japanese forces will, over the next few years, have no capability
                                for employment outside of Japan to assist U.S. forces in bringing
                                military conflict short of general war to a rapid and successful
                                conclusion. In the near future Japan will probably be of little
                                assistance in the successful accomplishment of the initial tasks of
                                a general war except to provide a base for U.S. military
                                operations.</item>

                            <item>With respect to the defense of Japan proper, the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff consider that Japan is capable of substantially increasing her
                                defense forces from her own resources, and that the Japanese
                                Government should assume a degree of responsibility for the defense
                                of Japan more nearly compatible with the country’s potential
                                capability. To date, however, the Japanese have not developed an
                                official long-range defense plan, nor have they adopted official
                                force goals for the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (<gloss

                                fall short of the U.S. Military Defense Assistance force objectives,
                                and even these forces are not being developed as rapidly as
                                scheduled.</item>

                            <item>The primary mission of the <gloss target="#t_JSDF1">JSDF</gloss>
                                in the defense of Japan for the short term will be the maintenance
                                of internal security, local ground defense, home-based air defense,
                                antisubmarine warfare, minesweeping and harbor defense. Operational
                                and logistical tasks in support of the primary mission will need to
                                be assumed by the <gloss target="#t_JSDF1">JSDF</gloss> as the
                                capability to perform these tasks is achieved. Once the <gloss

                                assumes the responsibility for greater defense of Japan, U.S. forces
                                and facilities would no longer be required for that purpose.
                                Although earlier phasing down of U.S. defense forces would weaken
                                the military defenses of Japan, it is recognized that other
                                considerations may justify the acceptance of this military
                                risk.</item>

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff reiterate that they consider that all
                                U.S. held islands in the Western Pacific, which are not currently or
                                fully utilized for military purposes, are nevertheless an integral
                                part of our base system in the Pacific. This applies particularly to
                                the Ryukyu and Bonin group where the continued use of the base
                                facilities will be required for the accomplishment of the broader
                                purposes set forth in paragraph 4 above. They represent potential
                                assets. Although the need for economy of force and the dictates of
                                national strategy will not permit the maintenance of garrisons or
                                continuous use in all positions, U.S. control must be maintained in
                                time of peace, in order to assure maximum availability in time of
                                war.</item>

                        <p>It should be noted that the Japanese estimate of their level-off
                            maintenance support cost is more than double their present defense
                            effort. If Japanese efforts cannot be substantially increased, U.S.
                            military aid, now in the magnitude of over $100 million annually, would
                            only fill one-third of the gap between present budget levels and the
                            ultimate maintenance requirement.</p>
                        <p>Japan’s leaders face serious popular opposition and political problems in
                            carrying out any rearmament program. While the six-year plan outlined
                            above represents a considerable increase over existing military forces,
                            it remains far below what Japan is capable of doing from the standpoint
                            of economic and manpower considerations.</p>

                        <p>During the Korean War, Japan was used by United Nations forces as a
                            staging and base area. It is doubtful that Japan would give permission
                            for a similar use in the future in the event of limited or localized
                            hostilities. Because of the psychological impact of the World War II
                            atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the fear that Japan would
                            again become a target area in the event of a future war, the Japanese
                            are not likely in the near future to permit stationing in Japan by U.S.
                            forces of nuclear weapons, particularly of an offensive nature. The

                            tactical nuclear weapons for its own forces. In this connection, recent

                        <p>Under Article 11 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan, Japan accepted the
                            sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by tribunals established by
                            the Government of the United States or by the International Military
                            Tribunal for the Far East. The power to grant clemency, <pb n="356"
                                xml:id="pg_356" facs="0384"/>to reduce sentences and to parole with
                            respect to prisoners sentenced by United States tribunals may not be
                            exercised except on the decision of the United States, and on the
                            recommendation of Japan. In the case of war criminals sentenced by the
                            International Military Tribunal for the Far East, such powers may not be
                            exercised except on the decision of a majority of the Governments
                            represented on the Tribunal, and on the recommendation of Japan.</p>
                        <p>There are now 66 Japanese war criminals, sentenced by United States
                            tribunals and subject to United States jurisdiction, imprisoned in
                            Japan. Australia, the only other Allied Nation continuing to detain
                            Japanese war criminals, holds only eight and has informed the Japanese
                            Government that it will complete the release of these prisoners by the
                            end of June 1957. The Soviet Union contends that it has released all
                            Japanese war criminals in its custody and Communist China has taken
                            steps to expedite the release of the remaining Japanese war criminals
                            which it holds. The Clemency and Parole Board, to which you have
                            delegated authority to make decisions regarding reductions in sentence
                            and parole, is finding it increasingly difficult to grant parole in the
                            remaining cases on the merits of the individual case. However, the
                            continued incarceration of these war criminals almost twelve years after
                            the termination of the war is an important source of political and
                            psychological friction between this Government and the Government of
                            Japan. The Japanese consider such detention as inconsistent with our
                            close alignment with them and again and again have requested that we act
                            to alleviate the situation.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State believes it desirable to develop a formula under
                            which the United States Government would release on a case-by-case basis
                            those remaining war criminals subject to United States control whom the
                            Japanese Government is willing to see released in Japan. This could be
                            accomplished by following the general policy of accepting the
                            recommendations of the Japanese Government based upon findings made by a
                            responsible and nonpolitical board, established by that Government,
                            after review of all pertinent facts in each case. The Department of
                            Defense has expressed the view that the present procedures under which
                            the Clemency and Parole Board makes the decision regarding individual
                            releases should be continued. It is believed the Clemency and Parole
                            Board would concur in this viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> be informed during his forthcoming visit that the
                            United States is aware of frictions created by the continued detention
                            of these war criminals and desires to terminate this issue. In view,
                            however, of American public sentiment which has been aroused by the
                            Girard case, it is believed that it would be <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357"
                                facs="0385"/>unwise to change procedures with regard to these war
                            criminals at this time. The matter will be kept under continuing review
                            and steps to alleviate the issue will be taken at an appropriate
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Alleviative action in Japanese cases should be accompanied by generally
                            comparable action with respect to the German war criminals in Western
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>All of the eleven living war criminals sentenced by the International
                            Military Tribunal for the Far East have been released from incarceration
                            by international action and are now on a parole status. The Japanese
                            have recently requested that a full pardon be granted to three of the
                            paroled prisoners since their parole status, and the restrictions which
                            are placed on their activities in view of this status, imposes a stigma
                            and hampers their return to public office.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> be informed that there is no provision for pardon
                            in the Treaty of Peace: the negotiating history of the Treaty indicates
                            that inclusion of the power to grant pardon in the terms of Article 11
                            was considered and rejected. However, the United States would favorably
                            entertain a request by the Japanese Government, addressed to the
                            Governments represented on the International Military Tribunal for the
                            Far East, that the sentences of the three parolees be reduced to time
                            served, which would have the effect of terminating parole and removing
                            parole restrictions. Reduction of sentence can be effected in such cases
                            by majority agreement of France, the Netherlands, Australia, New
                            Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada, Pakistan and the United States.</p>

                        <p>The meeting was held to discuss matters likely to arise during the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> visit. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> began the discussion,
                            saying that we are entering a new phase in our relations with Japan. In
                            the last eighteen months they have restored their political relations
                            with seventy-two countries, and have regained economic viability. Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, he said, is a
                            vigorous, dynamic, ambitious politician. He says there must be a
                            readjustment in relations with the United States. The Socialist party
                            has gained strongly in the last few years, largely because of lack of
                            leadership on the part of the Conservatives. The press in Japan is not
                            of top caliber. Owners are very conservative, but the material printed
                            is very negative and leftist. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> thought that if we do not work with Japan,
                            within five years they will be headed in the wrong direction. They might
                            adopt neutralism, perhaps on the Swiss, but perhaps on the Indian,
                            model. They might even turn to work with the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that with
                            regard to security and defense, Japan has certain changes in mind,
                            including amendment of the Treaty. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            thought it was not desirable to tinker with the Treaty, but felt that
                            steps can be taken to put our relationship on a more cooperative basis.
                            If the Japanese are simply trying to ease us out and then be
                            independent, we should find this out, and probably pull out on our own.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that if we
                            give <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> the measures he is
                            requesting, he thinks he can get himself into position to make
                            constructive changes in the Constitution within a year or two. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked what the group
                            thought of the idea of joint control of disposition and use of forces.
                            The President saw no objection to joint control of dispositions, in the
                            sense of joint agreement on changes therein. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said the Joint Chiefs feel we
                            cannot count on use of Japan, and therefore are willing to pull out. It
                            was stressed that we should not agree to any joint control of the use of
                            U.S. forces. Secretary Quarles said that with regard to withdrawal from
                            Japan, Defense proposes to take out 40% in the next twelve months (i.e.,
                            approximately 40,000) including all our ground forces. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> has asked for withdrawal of the
                            maximum, including all ground forces.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he felt we should take the initiative in this
                            matter, and shift the burden for proposals to continue our forces there
                            from ourselves to Japan. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> added that Defense is planning no longer to
                            advise the Japanese as to the forces they should have, but rather to let
                            them decide for themselves. One implication of this was that we would
                            thereby reduce our obligation to support them.</p>
                        <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0387"/>
                        <p>Secretary Quarles suggested that the President might emphasize our mutual
                            defense interest in the West Pacific, as well as the free world interest
                            in security in that area.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> next referred to
                            territorial problems, indicating the Japanese want us to agree to pull
                            out of the Ryukyus in some fixed period of time. The President asked if
                            we could not connect our withdrawal to some development in the cold war
                            situation. A major improvement in this situation would reduce the need
                            for forces in the Western Pacific. Also, it would be possible to relate
                            withdrawal to substantial disarmament steps. Secretary Quarles pointed
                            out that such a condition is a rather “tough” one, since it does not
                            seem to be in sight in any near future. He felt we should be very
                            careful not to give them a claim to the Ryukyus or the Bonins. The
                            President commented that we are staying there only because of the
                            Communist threat, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> pointed out that such a condition already exists
                            in the security treaty. Little could be added by repeating it. If we
                            give up our position in Japan, we have all the more reason to stay in
                            Okinawa. The President still thought that this would be the best way to
                            define the period we intend to stay in Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Japanese proposals for the return of former residents of
                            the Bonin Islands to those islands, State indicated readiness to agree
                            to some number going back, but Defense was opposed to having any go
                            back. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName>
                            suggested bringing back about 2500 (of the 7000 involved). Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that they will
                            adopt an attitude of hostility toward our military organizations there,
                            and will steadily demand more from us. The President asked why we have
                            so different an outlook as between Germany and Japan in this matter. We
                            are present in Germany only by their insistence. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he was inclined to feel
                            that if we let the Bonin Islanders in, the result would be trouble for
                            us. While the action might give <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> some immediate prestige, he thought the matter
                            could be left in abeyance until later in the conference. The President
                            asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> to let him
                            have a memorandum concerning the military requirements in the
                                Bonins.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">See <ref target="#d185">Document
                                    185</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>On the subject of nuclear testing, the President suggested that State
                            arrange for a thorough briefing of <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> regarding our disarmament plans. The subject of
                            war criminals was next discussed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> wound up by suggesting that we should shift the
                            responsibility on to the Japanese for deciding as to the parole of the
                            remaining sixty-six in prison, and the President agreed, adding that we
                            should make clear to the Japanese their responsibility for seeing that
                            justice is maintained, since some of the offenses were quite
                            heinous.</p>
                        <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0388"/>
                        <p>After discussion of problems in the area of United States-Japanese trade
                            relations, it was agreed to point out the successful results of efforts
                            of a voluntary character to keep problems under control. With regard to
                            Japanese proposals for an economic development fund, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> are making a study of the
                            Japanese plan. On the matter of trade with Communist China, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that we cannot prevent the Japanese
                            from following the British course. He said that he felt our allies
                            should have given more weight to our views, in recognition of the fact
                            that we are carrying the major defense responsibilities in that area. He
                            said that the Japanese will now say that they must follow the British
                            because of the need to maintain their competitive position.</p>

                                maintain forces in Japan unless Japan wanted them, and also that we
                                had already decided to reduce our forces by forty per cent in the
                                next twelve months including the withdrawal of all ground combat

                                    perhaps along the lines that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"

                                the return of certain Bonin Islanders. While a decision as to
                                whether or not some of the islanders would be permitted to return
                                was deferred, the President nonetheless wanted to have a look at a
                                possible formula. (Note: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"

                            <item>The Secretary discussed with the President Japanese pressures for
                                us to take legal action against the states of Alabama and South
                                Carolina because of their discriminatory laws against Japanese
                                textiles. The President approved the following position:</item>

                        <p>We would explain to <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> the
                            complications in taking legal action and the strong desirability of
                            obtaining voluntary repeal next year after the legislatures reconvene.
                            If <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> presses hard for legal
                            action the Secretary would commit the U.S. Government to institute legal

                            we do not have important military installations. The exact number to be
                            repatriated would have to be determined by the United States after
                            making a survey as to the number of islanders the available areas will
                            support. The persons to be selected for repatriation should be genuine
                            Bonin Islanders who were well established Island residents before World
                            War II. They would also have to be screened to establish that they were
                            returning to the Islands for the purpose of establishing an orderly

                        <p>The attorneys for Girard filed <note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">On June
                                6.</note> in the United States District Court for the District of
                            Columbia an application for a writ of habeas corpus naming as defendant,
                            among others, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> and <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0391"
                            />Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>.
                            The relief requested was that Girard be brought before the Court in
                            order to determine the legality of the action taken by the United
                            States, through the Joint Committee, in notifying the Japanese
                            authorities that the United States authorities did not intend to try
                            Girard. This is an appropriate means under United States law to
                            determine such a question. Pending a determination of this issue, the
                            Court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting all concerned
                            from turning Girard over to the Japanse authorities.</p>
                        <p>As is well known, the United States Government, acting through the United
                            States Attorney, assisted by other attorneys representing the Department
                            of Justice, opposed this application and filed briefs and submitted oral
                            argument in opposition to the application by Girard’s attorneys.</p>
                        <p>The decision of the District Court <note n="3" xml:id="d180fn3">Rendered
                                June 18; for text, see Marjorie M. Whiteman, ed., <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Digest of International Law</hi>, vol. 6 (Washington: U.S.
                                Government Printing Office, 1968), p. 747.</note> was that the
                            proposed delivery of Girard into the custody of the Japanese authorities
                            for trial would violate Girard’s rights under the Constitution of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>We are advised by the representatives of the Department of Justice that
                            they believe that this decision is erroneous and they intend to appeal
                            it, if necessary, to the United States Supreme Court. These attorneys
                            also advise that—regardless of the result—it is practically inevitable
                            that we shall not be able to obtain a final determination of this
                            controversy by the Supreme Court until fall—since the Supreme Court is
                            recessing for the summer and will not convene again until October. In
                            the meantime, the attorneys have no doubt that the restraining order
                            binding upon the Secretaries of State and Defense, as well as the
                            military authorities, will be continued in full force and effect until
                            such final determination can be secured.</p>
                        <p>As is well known, the United States, despite the strongest pressure from
                            public opinion, has consistently taken the position that it would honor
                            its commitment to turn over Girard to the Japanese authorities for
                            trial. There has been no change in that position, as indicated by the
                            decision to appeal to the upper courts, despite the District Court’s
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, it is imperative that everything possible be
                            done to defer a trial before the Japanese court until the American
                            authorities are free, under our law, to comply with a request that
                            Girard be produced for trial. While it is impossible to predict with
                            certainty the outcome of any litigated matter, the attorneys of the
                            Department of Justice have advised us that they believe that the
                            decision <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0392"/>of the District Court
                            is erroneous and should be reversed on appeal, either by the Court of
                            Appeals or by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
                        <p>By analogy to the practice in the United States courts, it would be
                            appropriate for the Public Prosecutor to request that a trial be
                            postponed until he had further opportunity to prepare his case.
                            Moreover, it is customary for courts to recess during the summer months,
                            and it is possible that the Girard case in the Japanese court could be
                            put over until the fall upon this ground.</p>
                        <p>In the happy event that a postponement could be obtained from the
                            Japanese court in as routine a manner as possible, there is a strong
                            likelihood that existing public agitation over this matter, both in
                            Japan and the United States, would subside. If we are able to secure a
                            Supreme Court decision reaffirming the legality of the Administrative
                            Agreement, as amended, this might also tend to lessen demands on the
                            part of certain members of Congress that legislation be enacted
                            requiring further changes in the Administrative Agreement, which could
                            lead to the embarrassment of both Governments.</p>
                        <p>In this matter, time is of the essence.</p>
                        <p>If any question is raised as to why the United States Attorney did not
                            argue that Girard’s action was not, in fact, “in performance of his
                            duty”, it might be answered along the following lines:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>If this issue had been raised, the court would have required that
                                Girard be brought back to the United States in order to have that
                                issue of fact resolved. The court so stated in its opinion.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The Department of Justice attorneys are of the view that the
                                action taken by the United States authorities in this case was legal
                                and constitutional, whether or not Girard was acting in performance
                                of his duty.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Such a contention would have been a predetermination of Girard’s
                                case before its consideration by the Japanese court and a change in
                                a position which was not withdrawn by the United States
                                representatives on the Joint Committee when they waived jurisdiction
                                under the Administrative Agreement, as amended.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>It may also be desirable to note that the court’s decision was made upon
                            the express assumption that: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>The Solicitor General inquired as to the seriousness of the situation
                            presented by the present posture of the Girard case. Deputy Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> spoke briefly on
                            its impact in Japan and attention was called to the fact that from the
                            view of the State Department most of the relevant considerations had
                            been set forth in the second affidavit filed on behalf of the Secretary
                            of State. <note n="5" xml:id="d181fn5">Not printed.</note> The JAG
                            representative pointed out that it had serious repercussions in that it
                            was probable that waivers could no longer be obtained for American
                            troops and that they would be put in foreign jails all of the time. It
                            would have a most unfortunate effect on the MSA Program, particularly in
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>After some further discussion along this line the Solicitor General
                            expressed the view that, in view of the importance of a request under
                            Rule 20, <note n="6" xml:id="d181fn6">This procedural rule allowed for
                                appeal of lower court decisions directly to the Supreme
                                Court.</note> they would probably require an additional and possibly
                            stronger affidavit from the Secretary of State. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> responded that he felt that the
                            Secretary of State had covered all the points he could in the affidavit
                            which had specifically been prepared for use in a Rule 20 proceeding. He
                            pointed out that the Secretary had even used the words of the rule
                            “imperative public importance” so as to put him on record that the case
                            was one coming under the rule. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1"
                                >Becker</persName> stated that we needed a fresh note here and this
                            could be secured <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0394"/>through an
                            affidavit on the part of the Secretary of Defense. He could pertinently
                            cover all of the points that were not fully dealt with in the Secretary
                            of State’s affidavit. The Defense representatives pointed out that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> was in Maine,
                            but it was suggested in return that we could scarcely ask the Supreme
                            Court to defer its vacation on the ground that the Secretary of Defense,
                            being on vacation, was unable to make an affidavit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rogers</persName> expressed himself strongly to the effect
                            that the really serious impact of this case, as he saw it, was that a
                            decision by the President, approving a joint decision of the Secretary
                            of State and the Secretary of Defense, could be held up for months, with
                            grave potentiality of injury to United States interests throughout the
                            world, by the decision of a United States District judge.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that the
                            action with respect to the waiver of jurisdiction had been taken by the
                            Army without prior consultation with the State Department. Mr. Dechert
                            conceded that State had not been consulted in the sense that its advice
                            had been requested, but insisted that the State Department was informed
                            from the very beginning. As a matter of fact, the Girard case first came
                            to his attention by reason of a cable from the United States Embassy in
                            Tokyo. Moreover, an Embassy representative had attended all meetings of
                            the Joint Commission. He also read from a cable of mid-April <note n="7"
                                xml:id="d181fn7">Possibly a reference to <gloss target="#t_DA1"
                                    >DA</gloss> 921933, <ref target="#d130">Document 130</ref>,
                                although it is dated April 26.</note> (the actual announcement to
                            the Japanese was not made until mid-May) directing three weeks of
                            further negotiation and then a waiver of jurisdiction if the Japanese
                            did not agree. A copy of this cable had been sent to State and there was
                            comment in a later State cable <note n="8" xml:id="d181fn8">Reference is
                                to telegram 2381, <ref target="#d131">Document 131</ref>.</note>
                            raising the question as to the Military’s right to interpret the
                            agreement, but saying that the issue would not be pressed in view of the
                            decision to waive jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Oscar Davis, on behalf of the Solicitor General, inquired whether we
                            could not gain the same favorable results by an immediate appeal to the
                            Court of Appeals. He felt that we could get an expeditious hearing
                            before the full Bench, and possibly a unanimous decision in our favor by
                            the Court of Appeals might induce the Supreme Court to deny certiorari
                            as soon as it convened in October. This might be a very expeditious way
                            of dealing with the case. It was pointed out, however, that the Court of
                            Appeals did not really want to handle this case because it knew that
                            eventually it would have to be denied by the Supreme Court. Furthermore,
                            there were additional considerations such as the fact that Girard’s
                            enlistment was up in October. Although <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367"
                                facs="0395"/>his discharge might be deferred by preferring charges
                            against him, as pointed out by JAG, this in itself might be considered a
                            violation of the agreement by the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>During the course of this discussion Deputy Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> left the meeting.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1"
                                >Becker</persName> expressed himself strongly in favor of an
                            immediate application requesting the Supreme Court to remain in session
                            for such period as it regarded appropriate for making a final
                            determination of the Girard case. The Solicitor General agreed that an
                            application for summary disposition would be out of order. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> relied in part upon the reasons
                            stated by Mr. Rogers and also upon the extreme importance of the case
                            insofar as the State Department was concerned. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> did not share Mr. Davis’ concern
                            that we would get a black eye were the Supreme Court to deny our
                            request. From the point of view of State, this would be a favorable
                            factor in our dealings with the Japanese, since they would appreciate
                            the fact that we were treating this matter as one of first
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>Both the Solicitor General and his assistant, Oscar Davis, expressed the
                            view that if the Supreme Court were requested to act under Rule 20 in
                            this case it would do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dechert</persName> expressed himself as in agreement with
                            the position taken by Mr. Rogers and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1"
                                >Becker</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Solicitor General expressed some concern over the effect on our
                            overall litigation position were we to irritate the Supreme Court by
                            requesting it to remain in session when the Justices were anxious to get
                            away. The others present at the meeting did not feel that this factor
                            should govern the decision, but recognized that it was a consideration
                            that Justice would have to evaluate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rogers</persName> commented that ultimately the question
                            would have to be decided by the President and the Secretary of State,
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> stated that it was
                            his view that this had been done.</p>
                        <p>Since the Solicitor General desired to discuss this matter further with
                            the Attorney General, the meeting broke up without any final statement
                            of position on the part of the Department of Justice.</p>

                        <p>During their call on the Prime Minister at the President’s Guest House,
                            Messrs. <persName>Robertson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> asked to see the Prime Minister privately to
                            discuss the Girard case.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said that he wanted
                            to make it clear that the United States Government was the defendant in
                            the motion brought by Girard’s attorney in the United States, and that
                            the Government was endeavoring to uphold the decision of the Joint
                            Committee. The Government was making every effort to have the trial of
                            Girard referred to Japan, but the matter was tied up in legal
                            proceedings. It would take some time to bring the matter through the
                            appeals court and the Supreme Court, but the Government was prepared to
                            take the matter to whatever court was necessary.</p>
                        <p>The President, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> continued, feel that
                            the decision of the Joint Committee was handled in accordance with
                            established procedures and that the decision has the support of the
                            Executive Branch of the United States Government, from the President
                            down. Since we must await the final decision of our courts, it would be
                            helpful if Japan could postpone the beginning of Girard’s trial through
                            some routine procedure. The United States was not making an official
                            request for postponement of the trial, but felt that if it could be
                            delayed it would be helpful from the point of view of Japan as well as
                            that of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that the Girard incident really was an
                            unfortunate one for both the Japanese and the American Governments. The
                            Japanese Government appreciates the stand taken by the United States
                            Government in spite of the difficulties with which it is faced. It is
                            important, he said, that both countries endeavor to prevent <pb n="369"
                                xml:id="pg_369" facs="0397"/>further excitement of public opinion
                            because of this incident. Regarding the point raised by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName>, the Prime Minister stated
                            that he would see what could be done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> then asked how long it
                            was expected to be before the Supreme Court could deliver its verdict.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> replied that he did
                            not know exactly, but that it might be a matter of several months if the
                            case had to go to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will adjourn on
                            next Monday (June 24) and will not reconvene until about October 1. He
                            wanted to emphasize, he continued, that the United States Government
                            intends to fight the case to the Supreme Court if necessary. <note n="2"

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that
                            we wanted to avoid a situation where the Japanese court might act and
                            demand Girard’s presence while the injunction against the United States
                            Government is still in effect. If any means, such as a court recess, the
                            need for time to prepare the case, or the like, could be found to
                            postpone the beginning of the trial in Japan, it would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> replied that he
                            understood the situation well and that he would try to work the matter
                            out smoothly.</p>
                        <p>The meeting thereupon ended.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister called on the President at the White House at 11:30
                            a.m., June 19, 1957. After greetings by the President, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that he was very happy to be
                            able to meet with the President, and felt that their meeting marked a
                            new turning point in Japanese-American relations and an opportunity to
                            strengthen ties between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>To begin with, the Prime Minister continued, “our conservative party”
                            (the Liberal-Democratic Party) is based on anti-communism, freedom, and
                            the recognition that Japan is a member of the community of free nations.
                            We follow a liberal, democratic policy. We are not neutralists, and
                            Japan will not go neutralist. With the help of the United States, Japan
                            has become a member of the United Nations, and as one of the free
                            nations has a heavy responsibility which it must live up to. Japan has
                            both domestic and international responsibilities; on the domestic side,
                            Japan’s policy is one of anti-communism; on the international side, it
                            is one of close cooperation with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that the two major
                            political parties in Japan are his own, the Liberal-Democratic Party,
                            and the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party, he stated, is led by
                            leftists, particularly by SOHYO, which is communist in thought. If the
                            Socialist Party should take over the government in Japan, the policies
                            of domestic anti-communism and intentional alignment with the United
                            States would come to an end, and it is therefore essential that the
                            Liberal-Democratic Party continue in power. During the last five years
                            the conservative party has divided, but now it has been unified and
                            strengthened, and it is essential that it remain in power in Japan to
                            carry out its policies and achieve internal stability.</p>
                        <p>The Liberal-Democratic Party, said the Prime Minister, has slightly less
                            than a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives and in the
                            House of Councillors, It is not likely that the Socialist Party would be
                            able to upset this majority within the next one or two elections and
                            take over the cabinet. On the other hand, the Liberal-Democratic Party
                            requires a full two-thirds majority to carry out the revision of the
                            constitution, and to attain that majority the party must gain the
                            support of the younger generation; it is necessary that steps be taken
                            now to make sure that the Socialists will not be in power ten years
                            hence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> does not believe
                            that the young people of Japan are Marxists, but on the other hand the
                            conservative parties of the last few years have not appealed to youth.
                            There is a rising tide of nationalism (but the Prime Minister emphasized
                            that he did not mean ultra-nationalism) in Japan, which insists upon
                            Japan’s independence. His party must, therefore, be able to act from a
                            position of independence.</p>
                        <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0399"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister went on to say that the Japanese masses are not
                            pro-communist, this would be contrary to their racial characteristics.
                            The majority, on the contrary, are friendly to the United States. Even
                            though they are friendly to the United States, however, this does not
                            mean that they would necessarily be satisfied with an indefinite
                            continuation of the present situation. There are certain things which
                            they feel ought to be rectified.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union, Communist China and the Japan Communist Party, said Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, tried at first to
                            communize Japan. They have failed in that, and now they are trying to
                            alienate Japan from the United States. If even a small crack is opened
                            between Japan and the United States, the communists will drive a wedge
                            into it. We must endeavor to prevent any such crack from being
                            opened.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he had already explained his basic thoughts
                            to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> in
                            Tokyo in an extremely frank manner, and that he did not expect that his
                            visit to the United States would in itself bring about solutions to all
                            of the problems which exist in Japanese-American relations. He did,
                            however, want to build a basis for future good relations, and wanted to
                            enumerate several of the outstanding problems in order to assist in
                            their understanding.</p>
                        <p>The first problem, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>,
                            was that of defense and the Security Treaty. Japan has put aside its
                            previous defense plans, which were not considered adequate, and the
                            National Defense Council has now adopted a Three Year Defense Plan. This
                            plan is not completely sufficient, but it is at least a first step in
                            line with the capacity and strength of the nation. Regarding the
                            Security Treaty and the Administrative Agreement, there are some who
                            want revision, and even some who call for abolition of these agreements.
                            But I, stated the Prime Minister, think that Japan could not get along
                            alone and that we need help even if we are to complete our Three Year
                            Plan. But the situation is different now from that at the time the
                            Security Treaty was signed. Then we had no troops; now we have our
                            Self-Defense Forces. Then the United States bore the entire
                            responsibility for defense; now we have a share. Moreover, we are now a
                            member of the United Nations. The fact that these differences exist
                            warrant our governments’ looking over the treaty at this time.</p>
                        <p>The year before last, the Prime Minister continued, as Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> will remember, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> asked that the Security
                            Treaty be revised into an “equal” agreement, because he believed that
                            Japan was in a “subjugated” position under the Treaty. I do not have
                            that feeling. There are, nevertheless, some matters which we would like
                            to see reconsidered. For instance, under the Treaty the employment of
                            your forces in Japan is subject to the unilateral determination of the
                            United <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0400"/>States; we would like to
                            have this subject to consultation with the Japanese side. Moreover,
                            there is no time limit on the Treaty; we would like to have some limit
                            set.</p>
                        <p>Next, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, I would like
                            to mention territorial problems. In the north Kunashiri and Etorofu are
                            occupied by the Soviet Union. In the south Okinawa and the Ogasawara
                            (Bonin) Islands are occupied by the United States. These four places
                            constitute our territorial problem. Regarding the northern islands, last
                            year during our negotiations with the Soviet Union the United States
                            made clear its interpretation of the San Francisco Treaty concerning
                            these islands. We intend to press on this point until we get a final
                            treaty with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese people, he continued, know that Okinawa is a powerful base
                            for the United States, and they are not opposed to its being a base
                            because they knew that it is for the security of the Far East. The
                            Japanese do not understand, however, why there is a need for the United
                            States to hold political and administrative power in Okinawa just
                            because it is a military base. They understand that Okinawa will
                            ultimately be returned to Japan, but the United States has
                            administrative power on an indefinite basis and it is not clear when the
                            return will be. There are two points, the Prime Minister said, which he
                            wanted to emphasize about Okinawa:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The 800,000 people of Okinawa are Japanese, and they are not
                                different from the rest of the Japanese people. The problems of
                                Okinawa are not simply those of 800,000 Okinawans, but of 90,000,000
                                Japanese. It may be thought that the Japanese Government interferes
                                too much in the affairs of Okinawa, but they are our people.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The land problem is serious. The territory is small, and arable
                                land is scarce. If land is taken for military use, even though
                                payment is made, no other land can be obtained, because there is no
                                other land. The people in Okinawa are therefore even more attached
                                to their land than are the people in other parts of Japan.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>This being the situation, it is in the interest of the United
                            States-Japan partnership to consider these issues.</p>
                        <p>The second territorial problem, continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, is the Bonin Islands. The people who used to live
                            there want to go back to the graves of their ancestors. Some solution to
                            this problem would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Also, he went on, a small matter and one having no direct connection with
                            the above is the problem of war criminals, who number 66. It is now
                            twelve years since the end of the war, and they remain in prison. If you
                            can do so (the Prime Minister emphasized the word “if”) I would
                            appreciate your expediting their release.</p>
                        <p>Next, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, are the
                            economic problems. Japan consists of four small islands, and has
                            90,000,000 people. This population constitutes a very great problem.
                            Lately, and with the help of the United <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373"
                                facs="0401"/>States, Japan has achieved economic recovery and even a
                            certain prosperity, but Japan must depend on foreign trade. Our biggest
                            market is the United States, and we appreciate the action of the Federal
                            Government regarding textile matters. We would be grateful if you do
                            everything possible to facilitate the orderly export of Japanese goods
                            to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Just prior to coming to the United States, the Prime Minister continued,
                            I visited Burma, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Thailand and Formosa.
                            Economically, politically and socially there is unrest in Southeast
                            Asia, and this provides grounds for communist infiltration. We must
                            build a basis for economic prosperity in Southeast Asia. Japan wants to
                            export to Southeast Asia, but we must first increase their purchasing
                            power. Japan wants to help in that.</p>
                        <p>The President broke in to ask which countries Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had visited, and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> repeated the
                            countries enumerated above.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> continued that there are
                            two basic problems in this area, capital and technical know-how. He said
                            that he would discuss these matters later in detail. Next, he said,
                            comes the question of trade with Communist China. Japan has geographical
                            and historical relationships with China, and the population problem
                            makes the people desirous of increasing foreign trade. In the <gloss
                                target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> discussions Great Britain has
                            done away with the China differential. Japan also favored this step, but
                            felt, as a member of the free world, that agreement should be arrived at
                            by all of the parties. The majority of the <gloss target="#t_CHINCOM1"
                                >CHINCOM</gloss> nations are following the British lead and
                            abolishing the differential, however.</p>
                        <p>The internal development of the Japanese economy, said Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, will require American help in the
                            form of capital and technical know-how in the future as it did in the
                            past. Lately, Japanese foreign trade has become unbalanced, and Japan’s
                            foreign exchange pattern has worsened. This has been mainly due to
                            increases in imports. The price level has remained stable, however, and
                            infiltration has been checked. Plant investment has been emphasized,
                            production facilities are being improved, and it is believed that the
                            situation will improve. The Prime Minister said, however, that any
                            assistance which the United States might be able to offer in this regard
                            would be appreciated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> thereupon concluded his
                            presentation, and asked for the President’s opinions.</p>
                        <p>The President said that all of these subjects would be discussed in
                            detail at his meetings at the Department of State, and said that he
                            would make only general comments.</p>
                        <p>First, said the President, he was delighted with the general presentation
                            made by the Prime Minister of his party’s aims and thoughts. The United
                            States recognizes the importance of Japan in the <pb n="374"
                                xml:id="pg_374" facs="0402"/>Western Pacific. The basic policy of
                            the United States is to maintain and develop our friendship with Japan.
                            We recognize also that Japan can be a true partner only if it is strong
                            spiritually, in the sense of combating the dangers of communism, strong
                            economically, and possesses defense forces capable of making it a real
                            ally in case of attack in that part of the world. Because of these
                            convictions, the President said, Japan’s problems would be viewed most
                            sympathetically and we would go in to the means by which the problems
                            could be solved and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            could be enabled to continue leadership of his party.</p>
                        <p>It must not be forgotten, the President continued, that the great burden
                            of defense in the Pacific lies upon the United States, and that for that
                            reason our forces stationed in Japan have been larger than would
                            otherwise have been the case. We are aware of the problems created for
                            Japan, and also for the United States, by the presence of our troops in
                            Japan. We do not like to be anywhere where we are not wanted. We are
                            therefore ready to consider beginning to withdraw our troops. We realize
                            that in a crowded country the presence of foreign troops causes
                            unusually acute problems and we are ready to talk about that as one of
                            the ways in which we can help.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the territorial problem, the President said, our only thought
                            is to be able to react swiftly in the even of attack without
                            interference. But we will talk over this problem and try to be
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>The President said that on the question of war criminals he had wished
                            for some time that that responsibility lay with Japan rather than with
                            the United States. The Secretary of State would have a formula to offer
                            concerning this matter. He wanted to point out, however, that some of
                            the war criminals had committed very inhumane acts, and he would like to
                            feel that the Japanese sense of justice would enter into the disposition
                            of the cases.</p>
                        <p>He realized, the President continued, Japan’s need for markets. When it
                            comes to the United States absorbing more goods, however, we have
                            problems. Pressure groups concerned with textiles, toys, cameras, etc.
                            come to the President and insist that imports be stopped. So far we have
                            found Japan’s voluntary means satisfactory, and in the meantime we are
                            using our influence in the matter of boycotts. We have, the President
                            pointed out, a peculiar federal system in the United States. The two
                            states which have laws against the sale of Japanese textiles have not
                            actually enforced those laws, however. In both these matters, said the
                            President, regarding imports and discrimination, we will do our best.
                            The administration firmly believes that the free world should work for
                            the increase of trade among its members.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would not comment now regarding economic aid
                            for Southeast Asia or trade with Communist China, as these were
                            technical subjects. Our thinking on Southeast Asia, however, was similar
                            to that of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>. We
                            understand completely <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0403"/>Japan’s
                            need for trade with Red China, but the President had two comments to
                            make. Our money is not unlimited; any plan for economic aid to Southeast
                            Asia must be supportable, realistic and practical. We feel that Red
                            China has only limited foreign exchange and capacity to pay for imports.
                            The removal of the China differential, therefore, will result merely in
                            a change of kind and not of amount in trade with Communist China. They
                            will now use their limited funds to purchase more warlike goods, but
                            there will be no overall gain in amount. We understand, however, that
                            even though this is so Japan must keep its competitive position
                            vis-à-vis England. We appreciate Japan’s sticking with us in the <gloss
                                target="#t_CHINCOM1">CHINCOM</gloss> talks, and we recognize her
                            needs now.</p>
                        <p>The President said that these matters would be discussed later in detail,
                            and the meeting ended at 12:30 p.m.</p>

                            back and share the responsibility with the Sec. We need a statement from
                            him. The Sec said they have been trying to shove it on to the Sec. B
                            said it is up to the Sec and the Pres to decide. We can save time going
                            directly and we have reason to think they will accept the case. The Sec
                            mentioned talking with the Pres about it. It would be done for full
                            argument said B—we would not want to do it on summary basis nor would
                            the Court. The Sec thinks we should go ahead and the Pres feels that
                            way. He said he would follow legal advice but his instinct is to move. B
                            said we cannot show a critical emergency but there is involved an
                            important point of Presidential power that would have world-wide
                            repercussions. The Sec said it affects our mutual security program and
                            the ability to station forces abroad. They have jurisdiction on their
                            soil except to the extent they relinquish it. B talked with
                            Knowland—There will be a hassle in Congress re waiving jurisdiction.
                            Knowland personally feels the Executive <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376"

                            had informed the Japanese Govt and they had acted on that. By checking
                            through the Ambassador we found it would be serious to reverse it. B
                            said unless you hear from us we will file in the Supreme Court.</p>

                        <p>The following items are submitted in brief explanation of some of the
                            more important factors from a military point of view to be considered in
                            connection with retention of the Bonin Islands. These factors relate
                            only to this element of the problem, and are not to be construed as
                            covering the entire problem.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (2 lines of source text) not

                        <p>Our base system in the Pacific Ocean is a single strategic entity which
                            comprises numerous island positions. While economy of forces will not
                            permit maintenance of garrisons in all these positions, the maximum U.S.
                            control must be maintained in order to assure maximum availability in
                            time of war.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">5 paragraphs (14 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Of interest in connection with the foregoing is the physical size and
                            conformation of these islands. They are small; they have almost no
                            economic potential and were utilized by the Japanese almost entirely to
                            increase Japanese military potential.</p>
                        <p>It has been contended that we should be willing to repatriate the Bonin
                            Islanders to areas on which there are no important military
                            installations. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that repatriation of a
                            Japanese-oriented group to any of these islands, regardless of whether
                            or not there are at present any military installations, would largely
                            negate their potential usefulness. Furthermore, the difficulties which
                            would ensue as a consequence of such partial repatriation are clearly
                            indicated by our experience in the Ryukyu Islands.</p>

                            and <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> were the senior

                            Hirohide Ishida.]</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State opened the meeting by referring to the general and
                            useful discussions which the Prime Minister had had the previous day
                            with the President. He stated that it had already been made evident that
                            we are approaching common problems in the spirit of friendship and are
                            searching for solutions in the common interest. He was particularly
                            happy to be present himself because of the earlier role he had had in
                            making the Peace and Security treaties with Japan. It was recognized at
                            that time that the relationship then being established was in the spirit
                            of respect for Japan and the desire to create a relationship on a
                            lasting basis. The Secretary assured the Prime Minister that the same
                            spirit now animated us as we approached a new era in our relations.</p>
                        <p>He suggested that for today’s agenda, the Prime Minister might first give
                            a presentation and then Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> might address the group on the world military
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that on
                            the afternoon of the previous day he had discussed basic Japanese-United
                            States relations with the President and the Secretary, and had told them
                            that Japan would stand firm with the United States and the western world
                            for their common safety in the future. The Japanese, he said, consider
                            themselves as belonging to the free nations and cooperation with the
                            United States is necessary for achieving peace throughout the world. It
                            was his understanding that the purpose of these conversations is to
                            establish friendly relations between the United States and Japan on a
                            firm basis.</p>
                        <p>It is not enough to have treaties on paper in order to achieve the
                            purpose of consolidating our relationships, but rather it is essential
                            that there be a true partnership. In this sense, the Prime Minister
                            looked to these conversations to achieve some of the understanding that
                            would provide the necessary foundation for such a relationship.</p>
                        <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0406"/>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> remarked that
                            there were certain specific problems which he would like to raise but he
                            thought it best to hear first Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName>’s remarks.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that, in order to ration time to the best
                            advantage, after Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>’s remarks the present meeting should continue until
                            11 o’clock, following which a more restricted session could be held to
                            discuss certain matters.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, directing his
                            remarks to the Prime Minister and the members of the Japanese
                            delegation, stated that he represented the United States Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff, who by law are charged with the military planning for the
                            security of the United States. They are also charged by law, he said,
                            with advising the President, the National Security Council and the
                            Secretary of Defense on military matters. In carrying out this
                            responsibility, they have to be careful to avoid allowing extraneous
                            factors to influence their judgment.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> then outlined the
                            world military picture, showing the order of battle between the Soviet
                            bloc and the free world side. On the free world side, a considerable
                            force has been created. He gave the figures as of March 1, 1957.</p>
                        <p>As for deployment and strength of ground forces, the Soviets have
                            8,213,000 men and the Allies 6,538,000. These figures include organized
                            police forces having military capability. Of the Soviet strength, 31
                            divisions are in the Vladivostok area and the remainder in western
                            Russia and the eastern satellites. There are also 33 Communist divisions
                            in north Korea. As for the allied strength opposed to this, there are
                            two United States divisions in south Korea and 21 <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions. In Japan there are six
                                <gloss target="#t_JSDF1">JSDF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USFJ1"
                                >USFJ</gloss> divisions. Additionally, there are twelve United
                            States and one Canadian division in North America.</p>
                        <p>With respect to naval forces the Communist bloc has 728 ships, including
                            six major ships, 34 minor ships and 150 submarines in the Far East. The
                            Soviet submarine force is based primarily in Siberian ports and is
                            larger than the German submarine fleet at the outbreak of World War II.
                            The total Russian submarine force is 450 boats and will soon exceed 500.
                            It is the largest such force ever built.</p>
                        <p>As opposed to the Communist naval forces, the Allies have a considerable
                            naval superiority and their superiority in the navel area is greater
                            than on the ground or in the air. This fact stems from the geographical
                            considerations, namely from the necessity to maintain communications
                            with our allies. The Communist bloc is self-contained and does not
                            require the same type of naval strength. Its main naval objective is to
                            interfere with allied communications.</p>
                        <p>With respect to air forces, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> stated that there is a rough balance at the
                            present time in over-all operational categories. The Soviets are making
                            great efforts to build up their bombing force, <pb n="379"
                                xml:id="pg_379" facs="0407"/>where they already have good modern
                            types. Their units are concentrated in Siberia, Manchuria and China
                            proper, constituting a powerful force in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Turning to strategy Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> stated that in 1953, when the present American
                            administration came in, the Joint Chiefs of Staff made a certain basic
                            assumption, namely that they would not prepare for a year of crisis—a
                            critical date. Rather, they would prepare for the long pull and build up
                            deterrent strength so that the Soviet Union would understand the risk of
                            committing aggression against the United States or its friends. The
                            decision was made to modernize, to maintain and to protect our deterrent
                            power. This power in the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has, since
                            1953, prevented the USSR from engaging in further aggression. Under this
                            umbrella our friends have been given time to work out their problems
                            with the USSR and their problems at home. In keeping this deterrent
                            power, the United States has a continental defense system in the United
                            States with advance lines in Canada and Greenland. But maintaining the
                            essential deterrent power and the essential naval power is becoming
                            increasingly expensive and it appeared necessary for our allies to bear
                            more of the costs of maintaining local security.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that there
                            are several facts of life in the Far East which he wished to point out.
                            There is the tremendous offensive and defensive power of the USSR.
                            Communist China’s power is growing along with its industrialization,
                            which is being facilitated by any trade with the West. There is an
                            armistice in Korea and it is necessary to maintain large <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, the third largest military
                            force in the free world. It is necessary to back up these <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces with substantial forces. It is
                            also necessary to keep United States forces in Taiwan. Their existence,
                            coupled with the presence of our naval units, has forced the Chinese
                            Communists to disperse their own forces along a 3,000 to 4,000 mile
                            coastline. In Indochina there is another split country and it is
                            necessary to increase the strength of our local friends as we have done
                            in Thailand and are trying to do in Laos and Cambodia. In the
                            Philippines, we have helped generate forces capable of maintaining
                            internal security and able, if necessary, of rendering some help in the
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> area in the event of
                            Communist aggression.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Japan itself, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> stated that the United States in 1952 was
                            willing to maintain forces in that country in the expectation that Japan
                            would build up its own forces in due course. In Japan also the United
                            States has had a logistic base for the support of Korean operations in
                            case hostilities should resume. This logistic base in Japan also serves
                            all United States army forces in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Budgetary limitations in the United States have required the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff to conclude that the United States forces of one hundred
                            thousand military personnel in Japan must be radically reduced. <pb
                                n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0408"/>However, it would be possible
                            to maintain our responsibilities in Korea and elsewhere with much less
                            than 50,000 men stationed in Japan. It is planned to withdraw all ground
                            combat units in Japan. If it would serve the Japanese domestic political
                            purpose the Joint Chiefs of Staff has concluded it could withdraw all
                            forces from Japan. They must not look at the problem sentimentally but
                            with the freedom which military men require. For this reason it is not
                            possible to alter the strategic status of the Bonins and the Ryukyus. On
                            the other hand, the <persName>Admiral</persName> said, the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff do not think Japan has built up its forces with the speed
                            required or the speed that might have been possible. The reason for this
                            may have been in part that Japanese military men are not accorded the
                            prestige required for them to discharge their responsibilities. In the
                            United States, civilians carry the principal responsibilities but they
                            also lean heavily upon military men for advice. The Admiral thought that
                            United States withdrawal might speed Japan’s defense build-up. He was
                            also of the opinion that the Japanese defense forces have reached
                            maturity in the sense of knowing what is required for Japan’s defense.
                            The military people of the United States will not, therefore, comment
                            further on Japan’s defense goals unless specifically requested to do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>On modern weapons, including missiles, the United States military have
                            not given Japan the information necessary for them to proceed, but this
                            has been because of lack of security legislation which would permit
                            passing on this information under our own laws.</p>
                        <p>This concluded the remarks by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName>. The Secretary asked whether the Prime Minister
                            desired to make any observations.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> stated that
                            Japan is gradually building up its defense forces and is going forward
                            in response to the needs of the situation and in proportion to the
                            national economic strength. Although he appreciated the remarks which
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> had made, he
                            pointed out that it is Japan’s policy to put greater emphasis upon
                            quality than upon quantity. As the Secretary probably knew, the Japanese
                            government had just adopted a plan to increase its defense forces by the
                            end of Japanese Fiscal Year 1960. He agreed with Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> on the necessity of increasing
                            the scientific study of advanced-type weapons and he realized that the
                            lack of certain legislation was creating an obstacle, but it was his
                            intention to see that the Diet passes such legislation before long.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would like to supplement Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s statement. The Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff, he said, believe that the best results can be achieved by
                            continued cooperation and with the continuing presence of some United
                            States forces in Japan, particularly air and naval forces. But, as
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said
                            yesterday at his press conference, it is not our purpose in any part of
                            the world where we have forces and bases to remain there in opposition
                            to local desires. <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0409"/>We would hope
                            that it is the desire of the Japanese people to continue the present
                            cooperation. We have forces in the United Kingdom, France and Germany,
                            and in those places, too, we can always accommodate ourselves to a local
                            request that we retire, much as we would regret the appearance of such a
                            sentiment. It is up to the Japanese Government to make the determination
                            about the continued presence of American forces.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated he would like to point out that the effectiveness of
                            our deterrent power depends upon there being a series of points around
                            the Soviet-Chinese bloc from which points retaliatory attacks can be
                            launched. By looking at the map it can be seen that it is not possible
                            to maintain at all points on the 20,000-mile perimeter of the bloc
                            forces sufficient to stop communist forces which could be directed at
                            them at any time from the interior. Therefore, to restrain such attack
                            it is necessary to depend, as Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> has said, upon retaliatory power, but to be
                            effective this retaliatory power must be based on many places. If based
                            only on one place, for example, the continental United States, it could
                            be nullified with only one attack. Only if staging areas for retaliatory
                            striking powers have diversified geographic locations, will they
                            adequately serve the purposes of deterring attack.</p>
                        <p>We naturally hope, said the Secretary, that Japan will cooperate in this
                            collective defense approach which is shared by most of the free
                            countries located around the Soviet-Chinese bloc. By looking at the map
                            you can see that it is indispensable for us to have such bases in the
                            Far East. The problem of working the problem out so far as Japan is
                            concerned is a matter we would wish to discuss on the basis of mutuality
                            and common interest. He thought it might also be mentioned that
                            countries such as the Federal Republic of Germany, the Philippines,
                            Formosa and Korea are anxious that United States forces should be
                            physically present to some extent because their presence provides a
                            guarantee that the United States will automatically retaliate if those
                            areas are attacked, since United States forces would have been attacked,
                            too.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Prime Minister agreed with the Secretary’s view that Japan’s
                            security is closely related to the safety of all free countries. He
                            would like to go beyond that and state his belief that in the Far East
                            Japan’s safety depends upon the security of the free countries in that
                            area. Therefore, the peace and safety of the Far East and that of Japan
                            itself require cooperation with the United States. He was in complete
                            accord with the Secretary and thought that the subject required no
                            further enlargement. He thought that on the whole there is understanding
                            by the Japanese of American problems and vice versa, but on the question
                            of defense the two nations are not in complete accord. He wished to say
                            that defense to be effective must go beyond <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382"
                                facs="0410"/>mere forms. It is a realm in which the wholehearted
                            support of the people is required. We must establish in these
                            discussions the foundations upon which the two nations can cooperate
                            wholeheartedly in all areas of defense.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister surmised that the lack of a really stable government
                            in Japan in the few years since the Peace Treaty has created some
                            difficulty, but he is happy to say that now a new and better situation
                            has been created. Progress has been made in the defense area and he
                            hopes for more. As the Secretary pointed out, it was not desirable that
                            United States forces be in any foreign country if it could be avoided.
                            He hoped that the Americans would understand that the Japanese
                            themselves are making all possible efforts to increase their own defense
                            capability and that they will continue on this course.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he would like to add a word.
                            Nations and peoples forget very quickly, and like to be lulled into a
                            sense of security and safety. The Soviet Communist leaders generally
                            talk constantly about peace, but the Secretary thought that we tend to
                            forget that Communism basically believes in the use of violence and has
                            used violence whenever it has thought it could do so successfully. In
                            this connection it is helpful to look at a map to follow the Communist
                            conquest by force. In the north there is Finland which was overcome in a
                            war by the USSR. Below that Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia no longer
                            appear on the map because they were overrun and extinguished. Poland was
                            obliterated in 1939 by the joint Russian-German attack. East Germany,
                            Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Rumania all are held at Soviet swordpoint.
                            Recent events in Hungary show the dependence of the USSR upon armed
                            force to maintain its conquests. Turkey and Iran have been threatened
                            from time to time but unsuccessfully. Greece was subject to a communist
                            insurrection in 1947. The Communists supported war in Indochina and
                            brought about the defeat of France at Dien-Bien-Phu. There was a Huk
                            rebellion in the Philippines supported by Communists from the outside.
                            At the present time there is a growing military threat opposite Formosa
                            and there is a suspended war in Korea. Tibet has been seized by force.
                            The fact should be kept in mind that any nation which stood alone around
                            the Communist orbit either has been endangered or has been seized by the
                            Communists; most of them have been seized. Only if they benefitted from
                            collective security have they been safe. Not a single nation which was
                            party to collective security arrangement with the United States has been
                            lost to the USSR or to Communist China. The collective security
                            relationship coupled with the tremendous retaliatory power of the United
                            States has given safety. But there is no doubt in the mind of our
                            political and military leaders that if the collective security system
                            should collapse, or if the USSR should gain the upper <pb n="383"
                                xml:id="pg_383" facs="0411"/>hand, the conquest of the rest of the
                            world would be resumed by the USSR. That is an important fact that the
                            peoples of the world would like to forget but which statesmen must
                            remember.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that he felt at one
                            with Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> regarding the world situation. In
                            this situation the problem was how to make firmer the cooperation
                            between the two countries. Some fundamental matters must be considered
                            in this connection.</p>
                        <p>First, security and defense. Two years ago Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> was here in Washington with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shigemitsu</persName> when the latter
                            told of Japan’s tentative plan for its self-defense forces. Since then
                            there have been a few developments. A law has been passed establishing a
                            National Defense Council to consider long range plans. Recently the
                            Council had set forth Japan’s principles of defense and a long range
                            plan which the government had adopted. There is nothing much new in the
                            plan and he would not go into details as he thought they were known. But
                            its main purpose, he said, is to make the necessary appropriations by
                            1960 for a 180,000 man ground defense force, 120,000 ton sea defense
                            force and 1,300 plane defense force. He added that while the
                            appropriations would be made by 1960 the actual construction,
                            particularly by the navy and air force, might require another two years.
                            The Prime Minister stated that Japan has been following the policy, as
                            America knew, of gradually increasing its defense capabilities. The
                            requirements for Japanese security can only be covered by a common
                            Japanese-United States arrangement. This is necessary and is recognized
                            by Japanese conservatives but it should be borne in mind that conditions
                            are now different from what they were at the time of the Security
                            Treaty. Japan is now able to share in its own defense. Japan has now
                            been admitted to membership in the United Nations and is consequently in
                            a collective security arrangement which it was not in at the time of the
                            Security Treaty. So the time has come to review the security
                            arrangements, not because they are unequal and must be equalized nor
                            because they are one-sided and have to be neutralized but rather because
                            of the need for creating wholehearted cooperation between the two
                            peoples.</p>
                        <p>The second fundamental matter Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> desired to touch upon was territorial problems.
                            There is a strong national sentiment, he said, to ask for the return of
                            such territories as have always been Japanese. In the north this
                            embraces the Kuriles, especially Kunashiri and Etorofu, and in the south
                            the Ryukyus and the Bonins. The Japanese recognize that security
                            requirements not only of the United States but also of Japan and of the
                            other free nations, involve the Ryukyus, and they recognize the
                            necessity for military installations in the Ryukyus, but even so they do
                            not quite agree that full administrative powers cannot be returned by
                            the United States. The strong national feeling on this point is evident
                            in the resolutions on the subject which have <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384"
                                facs="0412"/>been passed by the Japanese Diet. Of course, the
                            Japanese understand the need for strong military bases and they
                            understand that there is some difficulty in reconciling military
                            requirements with the transfer of civil administration, but Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> wanted Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> to understand the strong national
                            feeling and to realize that the 800,000 people living on Okinawa are
                            Japanese citizens. Moreover, somewhat more than 100,000 people of
                            Okinawan origin were living in Japan. Thus United States administration
                            in Okinawa was not just a matter affecting 800,000 Okinawans. All the
                            people of Japan are concerned.</p>
                        <p>A second territorial problem concerns the land in Okinawa. If land is
                            requisitioned for military purposes no other land can be found to be
                            used in its place. The United States should handle this matter
                            carefully, understanding Japan’s sensitivities on the point.</p>
                        <p>The Bonins provide a third territorial problem, said Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>. The same things can be said of
                            the Bonins as of Okinawa but there is the additional problem of the
                            return of some of the previous inhabitants. Some of the former
                            inhabitants, numbering about 200, were allowed to return but these were
                            of European extraction. This represented a discrimination in Japanese
                            eyes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> stated that the United States recognizes
                            the changes which have occurred since 1951 when the Peace and Security
                            treaties were made in the spirit of friendship which still characterizes
                            the relations of our governments. These matters should be subject to
                            review in light of changing conditions, but the United States does not
                            think that Japanese membership in the United Nations adequately takes
                            care of its security needs or those of others. The drafters of the
                            United Nations Charter, of which he himself was one, hoped that a
                            collective security force could be maintained to deter aggression.
                            Articles 43 and 44 were drawn up for this purpose but they became dead
                            letters because of the Soviet refusal to implement them, a refusal
                            demonstrated through the use of the veto. Therefore, those who desired
                            to insure the application of the collective security principle had to
                            proceed through Article 51 which was devised to overcome the anticipated
                            Soviet veto of 43 and 44 action. Forty-six nations of the free world
                            have in fact acted under Article 51. We also, of course, observe with
                            satisfaction the increase of Japan’s military power as contemplated by
                            the Preamble to the Security Treaty—“Japan will itself increasingly
                            assume responsibility for its own defense”. We would hope, however, that
                            Japan’s efforts would become more serious because, when compared to the
                            efforts of other free nations they are not so great. The United States
                            devotes 11% of its gross national product to security measures; the
                            United Kingdom, despite a serious financial situation, 10%; and most of
                            the European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries devote 8%
                            to 9%. We calculate that Japan devotes about 2%. We recognize that Japan
                            faces serious economic problems and we would not expect it to <pb
                                n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0413"/>devote the same percentage as
                            the United States does, but it is difficult in the United States and in
                            our Congress to avoid the view that Japan is taking its defense
                            responsibilities lightly. There is danger of a vacuum of power
                            developing in a part of the world where Soviet-Chinese communism is
                            strongly at work. This could lead to complications because we know that
                            the industrial power of Germany in the West and Japan in the East are
                            major objectives of the international communists.</p>
                        <p>Despite these observations, said the Secretary, he would like to express
                            gratification for the statements which had been made by the Prime
                            Minister. In our view certain steps could be taken within the context of
                            the present Security Treaty to allow more scope to Japan in the conduct
                            of its own self-defense. One of these, and most important, would be the
                            substantial reduction of United States forces in Japan. Other steps were
                            more technical in character.</p>
                        <p>With respect to territorial arrangements, stated the Secretary, we
                            appreciate Japanese sentiments toward the related population in the
                            Ryukyus and particularly Okinawa. The United States has no desire to
                            assume administrative responsibilities not necessary for the military
                            use of an area. It has no desire to exercise power just for the sake of
                            power. This fact he thought was demonstrated by the voluntary
                            relinquishment of administrative control by the United States of Amami
                            Oshima in 1953. However, we do not see any possibility of relinquishing
                            control in Okinawa because our responsibilities for the defense of
                            Japan, ourselves and other free nations. The Secretary recalled that
                            when he was negotiating the Peace Treaty the United States was under
                            very substantial pressure from some countries to annex the Ryukyus.
                            These countries wanted it to be certain for all time that the United
                            States would have a bastion of strength in that part of the world as
                            they regarded it necessary for their own security. The United States
                            resisted that pressure and accepted a formulation which would involve
                            the retention by Japan of residual sovereignty. But we cannot in justice
                            to ourselves, and other countries dependent upon us, take steps which we
                            consider would dilute the strength we consider necessary in the present
                            situation. Of course if the international situation should change we
                            would review our position. In any event, said the Secretary, we shall
                            strive as the Prime Minister suggested to control our actions in the
                            Ryukyus with care and concern for Japanese and Okinawan
                            sensitivities.</p>
                        <p>The problem of the Bonin Islands is one involving a position of
                            considerable strategic value and very little economic value and at
                            present little administration, the Secretary pointed out. He asked the
                            Prime Minister to consider whether we would really improve the relations
                            of our two countries if the United States introduced into these <pb
                                n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0414"/>Islands people who would have a
                            hard time earning a livelihood and whose presence would involve the same
                            type of problems we now have in Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that the hour of eleven had been reached and he said
                            he would defer to the Prime Minister’s desires with respect to
                            continuing the present meeting or transferring to his office for a
                            smaller meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the Japanese side had now heard various
                            opinions from the American side with respect to the Security Treaty. For
                            these they were grateful. They were especially grateful that the United
                            States was willing to study this matter if the international situation
                            should change.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then asked the Prime Minister before the
                            present meeting should break up to designate two persons from the
                            Japanese side to work on the Communiqué Committee. The Prime Minister
                            designated Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishida and Foreign Office American
                            Bureau Chief, <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiba</persName>, who would
                            work with a few assistants. The Secretary on his side appointed
                            Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BAH1">Berding</persName> and
                            Mr. <persName>Parsons</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said we must consider what we would tell the press
                            following the present meeting. There should be no leaks which the final
                            communiqué would not justify. The Prime Minister thought it better not
                            to mention substance, particularly his remarks on the necessity for
                            security legislation, as this would be embarrassing to him. Mr. Ishida
                            said we might tell the press that we had had a general discussion on
                            matters of a political nature between the United States and Japan. The
                            Secretary proposed and it was agreed that the press be informed that
                            political and security problems had been discussed and views on these
                            matters had been exchanged.</p>
                        <p>The meeting then adjourned.</p>

                        <p>At 11:00, June 20, 1957, the Secretary asked the above participants to
                            join him in his private office. The Secretary told the Prime Minister
                            that if they were to accomplish what each hoped to have accomplished
                            they would have to move swiftly and concretely. Time did not permit all
                            the niceties of diplomatic usage, but the Secretary would tell the Prime
                            Minister what could be done along the lines he desired. The Secretary
                            inquired what were Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            desires regarding the Security Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> replied that in view of
                            what should be the governing sentiment of partnership between the two
                            countries Japan thought that it should have the right of consultation
                            concerning the disposition of United States forces in Japan. As a second
                            point, some provision should be made to clarify the relationship of the
                            Security Treaty and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter.
                            Third, if possible, a clear date should be set for the expiration of the
                            Treaty, to signify the extent of time the Treaty would be in force.
                            These three points were made, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1"
                                >Chiba</persName> said, not because Japan wanted to weaken the
                            Treaty or, as Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> had said, “dilute” the
                            relationship between the United States and Japan, but because it was
                            felt that these points would contribute to a greater understanding among
                            the Japanese people of the fundamental friendship between the United
                            States and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he thought he could agree in principle that
                            there should be consultation respecting the disposition of United States
                            forces, but that this would not apply in an emergency situation <pb
                                n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0416"/>where there was not time for
                            consultation. This problem, he said, might be greatly minimized by the
                            reduction in our combat ground forces which we contemplate carrying out
                            at once. He asked the Prime Minister at what time and in what form he
                            would like to have an assurance regarding this reduction in forces.</p>
                        <p>On the second point, the Secretary continued, he believed that we could
                            make clear the relationship between the Security Treaty and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by, for example, making appropriate
                            reports to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> of any actions taken
                            under the Treaty significant from the point of view of international
                            peace and security. He did not think, however, that Article 4 of the
                            Treaty could be altered to provide an expiration date. This would
                            require submission to the United States Senate of an amendment to the
                            Treaty, which would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate for passage.
                            The Secretary thought that this would be difficult to obtain because we
                            would be unable to explain in a way satisfactory to the Senate what the
                            relationship would be between the United States and Japan in the event
                            that the Treaty ceased to exist.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he gathered that the Prime Minister did not
                            want, at this time, to suggest the replacement of the Security Treaty by
                            another type of treaty. It would be preferable not to have to take any
                            revision of the present Treaty to the Senate where the debate would not
                            be helpful to Japanese-American relations and where the outcome would be
                            doubtful. We could, the Secretary continued, of course reaffirm in the
                            communiqué or in a letter the view of the United States Government that
                            the Treaty was never designed to operate in perpetuity and that we hope
                            that coming circumstances or other arrangements will permit its
                            termination under Article 4.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he understood that there had been criticism in
                            Japan of Article 1 of the Security Treaty, under which the United States
                            accepts the right to help, at the request of the Japanese Government, to
                            put down internal riots due to the intervention of an outside power.
                            This was to be done, the Secretary pointed out, only at the request of
                            Japan, and he would have no objection to having it made clear publicly
                            that such action would never be taken except at the express request of
                            the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then stated that he had no thought whatever of seeking
                            to abolish the Security Treaty in its basic sense. In the practical
                            implementation of the Treaty, however, he felt, or in its form, the
                            Japanese people believe that there is room for improvement. He would
                            like to adjust the Treaty to the sentiments of the people. There was now
                            a new situation, and he wondered whether a new, high-level committee
                            could not be established to consider improvements in the implementation
                            of the Treaty. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> had stated that it would
                            be difficult to obtain Senate ratification, but the Prime Minister
                            thought <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0417"/>that it would be
                            possible to solve the problems of consultation on the disposition of
                            forces and reports to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> with no
                            actual change in the form of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the Prime Minister felt disposed to respond
                            to his question regarding making public the intent of the United States
                            to reduce its forces in Japan. The Prime Minister should understand, he
                            went on, that we are ready to announce now that we will wholly eliminate
                            our ground forces from Japan within a year and that we will make
                            substantial reductions in our other forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> replied that he thought
                            this announcement should be made in connection with his visit to the
                            United States. He said that he would study the question of form and
                            timing and reply on those points during the afternoon meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that he had something that he had wanted to say
                            to the Prime Minister in the present small group. He assumed that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s Government desired to
                            continue its close and intimate relationship with the United States,
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> shared, broadly
                            speaking, our estimate of the danger from Soviet and Chinese Communism,
                            and that these present talks were not designed just to ease the United
                            States out of Japan because Japan did not want us with them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> broke in with the
                            exclamation, “Absolutely”.</p>
                        <p>If that is so, the Secretary went on, then there is a large area in which
                            we can work together and cooperate. But if, and I do not believe or hope
                            that such is the case, it is the desire of the Japanese Government that
                            we divorce ourselves from Japan, we will accommodate ourselves to that
                            wish. There are alternative arrangements we can make in the Far East.
                            Australia, for instance, had a mission here a few days ago asking that
                            we develop Australia as an industrial base in place of Japan. I have
                            believed throughout my association with Japan, the Secretary said, when
                            I worked on the Peace Treaty and the Security Treaty, that there was a
                            basis for friendly and close cooperation between our two countries. But
                            I want to be sure that this is what the Japanese Government really wants
                            because if not we will not impose ourselves on Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> replied that as he had
                            said on many occasions his conservative party (i.e., the
                            Liberal-Democratic Party) feels that Japan’s future lies only in close
                            cooperation with the United States. The Socialist Party, however, does
                            not necessarily hold the same view, and if the Socialist Party came into
                            power it is likely that this policy would be completely changed. The
                            problem, therefore, is how the conservative party can be continued in
                            power on a long term basis.</p>
                        <p>Can we understand, the Secretary asked, first that the Prime Minister
                            will consider and let us know at our 3:00 p.m. meeting the form and time
                            he desires for our public announcement of a precise statement <pb
                                n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0418"/>on the reduction of our forces
                            in Japan. We will include in the communiqué or in an exchange of
                            letters, he continued, a statement that we will establish a joint group
                            to study problems concerning the implementation of the Security Treaty
                            and among other things the implementation of the principle of
                            consultation wherever practicable by Japan and the United States
                            regarding the disposition and employment of such United States forces as
                            will remain in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> answered that this would
                            be fine.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it should also be considered how to establish the
                            maximum relationship with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> through
                            such reporting as might be appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiba</persName> asked whether this was
                            also to be the responsibility of the proposed joint group. The Secretary
                            answered that it could be either way the Prime Minister wanted, either
                            handled by the joint group or included in the final communiqué. The
                            Prime Minister said that he would consider this question and reply
                            later.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked whether, in the light of what he had said
                            before, the Prime Minister desired some statement to be made about the
                            expiration of the Security Treaty and the fact that we reaffirm that the
                            Treaty was not meant to be in perpetuity, but for a transitory
                            period.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that his thought had
                            been that the Treaty should be amended so as to have an initial period
                            of validity for five years from the present, with each party to have the
                            option of termination at one year’s notice thereafter. However, he felt
                            that if some expression that the Treaty was not intended to be perpetual
                            could be made, that might serve to a certain extent the purpose he had
                            in mind.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he thought appropriate language could be found
                            for that purpose. He continued that, regarding the question of Okinawa
                            and the Ryukyus, it was very difficult to see how any significant
                            statement could be made on either matter, but he would be prepared to
                            study further whether a very limited number of former inhabitants of the
                            Bonin Islands could be permitted to return there.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> asked about how many
                            this number might be, the Secretary replied that he thought the maximum
                            would be about two or three hundred, perhaps. The actual number of
                            persons would have to be established with a view towards security
                            requirements (and he mentioned that the islands were being used for
                            military purposes more than is generally realized) and in line with the
                            amount of land available. There was only little arable land, he pointed
                            out, for farmers and only one port for fishermen.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that he did not know whether the President would
                            approve the idea even in principle, but it might be possible to make a
                            survey of the islands which would lead to the reintroduction of a
                            relatively small number of people. He wanted, however, to emphasize <pb
                                n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0419"/>two things: one, that our
                            ability to reduce to some extent the military use of land in Japan
                            involves the more intensive use of the Bonins, and two, that if the
                            objective of the Prime Minister was to get relations on a better
                            long-term basis, in the Secretary’s opinion the return of a few hundred
                            persons to the Bonins might give the Prime Minister the impression of an
                            immediate accomplishment but the problems which might grow out of this
                            in the future would be even more difficult. The present 176 residents of
                            the Bonins are essentially oriented towards the United States, and would
                            like to become American citizens. If there were added in that meager
                            territory even seven hundred persons more oriented toward Japan, it
                            would cause difficulties and friction and future embarrassment to both
                            countries. Perhaps the Prime Minister would consider this matter
                            further.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> would like to discuss the matter of war criminals
                            then or later.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that regarding
                            Okinawa he had another request on the part of Japan, which had to do
                            with the question of lump-sum payment for land requisitioned for
                            military use. There have been proposals in Japan, he said, for an
                            investigation by a committee composed of American Congressmen and
                            Japanese Diet members which would result in a joint decision on this
                            matter. He asked whether the United States could defer measures being
                            taken to requisition further land in Okinawa pending such an
                            investigation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that it was not practicable from our standpoint to
                            turn this responsibility over to Congress. Our system differs from the
                            parliamentary system, and under our Constitution the President conducts
                            foreign affairs, is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and cannot
                            delegate those responsibilities to a Congressional Committee. The United
                            States, he went on, is making a very close restudy of the land
                            requirements in those area; he was not sure whether this would lead to
                            any re-estimate of the requirements in Okinawa, but we were requesting
                            the military to cut their requirements to the absolute minimum.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> pointed out that there
                            was no alternate land for the farmers in Okinawa when their land was
                            requisitioned and asked whether the United States could assist in
                            emigration of the affected persons to other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary answered that this question was new to him, and he would
                            not be able to reply at once. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> commented that the problem was to get the
                            other countries to accept the immigrants. The Secretary jokingly
                            remarked that he would like to see some of the Okinawans settle in New
                            Guinea, but that the Australians would not have it. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> remarked that a colony of
                            Okinawans had been moved to Bolivia last year, but that it had not
                            worked out well.</p>
                        <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0420"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> inquired whether thought
                            had been given to resettlement of Okinawans in the Trust Territory, or
                            on Saipan or Tinian. The Secretary said that this question would be
                            explored. He remarked, however, that the new jet aircraft are taking
                            more space all the time in Okinawa and other places, and he did not know
                            what could be done about the problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that he was very
                            desirous of meeting the anxiety of the Japanese people. He asked whether
                            consideration could be given to permitting the flying of the Japanese
                            flag in Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>The time had come for the Prime Minister’s party to depart for the
                            Capitol, however, and the meeting came to an end at 12:05 without this
                            question having been answered.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary opened the meeting by saying that he was prepared to
                            discuss the question of war criminals unless the Prime Minister wished
                            to refer back to any of the subjects discussed during the morning
                            meeting.</p>
                        <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0421"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he would like to proceed to the matter of
                            war criminals and then go back later to other subjects. He explained
                            that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> of
                            Australia had recently visited Japan and had announced that Australia
                            agreed to the release of the war criminals being held at its direction;
                            the United States therefore was the only country which still required
                            the Japanese Government to confine war criminals on its behalf, of whom
                            there are sixty-six. No doubt the United States has many reasons for
                            this, but on the other hand more than ten years have now passed since
                            the end of the war, and there is no information as to when these
                            prisoners may be released. This is not to the advantage of either
                            country. Moreover, the Prime Minister continued, those Class A war
                            criminals who have been released are still under parole and their
                            activities are therefore restricted.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that consideration had been given to the latter
                            category, Class A criminals who had been sentenced by the international
                            courts, and the United States desired to do whatever seemed to be
                            legally feasible. The question of pardon had been considered, but after
                            a study of the history of the Peace Treaty it had been concluded that
                            this was not practicable. Originally, he explained, the draft of what
                            became Article 11 of the Treaty had contained a provision for pardon but
                            this had been stricken out because of the opposition of some of the
                            Allies. If the agreement of the majority of the members of the
                            international tribunal can be obtained however, we think that the
                            sentences can be reduced to the time already served, and thus the parole
                            status will automatically terminate and the restrictions will be
                            removed. This would, under the Peace Treaty, require a request by Japan
                            and the concurrence of the majority of the countries represented on the
                            tribunal. No public announcement could therefore be made at this time.
                            If Japan so desires, however, the United States would informally inquire
                            of the other nations represented on the tribunal whether they would
                            accede to a formal recommendation from Japan for clemency, so that Japan
                            might be spared any embarrassment in the event such concurrence could
                            not be obtained.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that he would be
                            very grateful if this could be done, and the Secretary replied that we
                            would act accordingly.</p>
                        <p>As to the 66 war criminals subject to American control, the Secretary
                            continued, we are prepared to try to find a solution, but it should be
                            said in advance that no public announcement would be practicable at this
                            time because of the agitation over the Girard case. These 66 men, he
                            said, have really very bad records and have been guilty of very grievous
                            atrocities. It would be undesirable to take any public action which
                            would revive memories which are recorded in the <pb n="394"
                                xml:id="pg_394" facs="0422"/>sentences of these men. As soon as the
                            atmosphere has become somewhat calmer, however, the United States would
                            be prepared to consider the formula which the Secretary said he would
                            outline.</p>
                        <p>Under this formula, the United States would suggest that the Japanese
                            Government establish a responsible, non-political board to review the
                            cases, including the trial records; the United States would make the
                            trial records available for this purpose. To the extent that this board,
                            after examination of the cases, considered clemency appropriate and the
                            Japanese Government recommended accordingly, the United States would be
                            prepared generally to accept the recommendations. The United States
                            would expect the board to exercise genuine and honest judgment in the
                            light of all the facts and we would then follow the recommendations of
                            the Japanese Government. We believe that this can be reconciled with the
                            provisions of Article 11 of the Peace Treaty which gives the power to
                            grant clemency to the Government which imposed the sentence, on the
                            recommendation of Japan. This would mean that we would expect in general
                            to follow the recommendation so made without any further independent
                            investigation on our part, thus placing the responsibility fully on
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that this would be a very satisfactory
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary cautioned the Prime Minister that this procedure could be
                            put into effect only after the present situation had quieted down, and
                            that it would not help either the United States or Japan to bring up the
                            details of these cases at this time. When the time comes, however, if
                            this formula is agreeable to Japan, we would proceed as rapidly as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that this would be a
                            happy solution. He then went on to say that Japan had long hoped for the
                            repatriation of the inhabitants of the Bonin Islands. He did not desire,
                            however, to bargain with the Secretary over the question of numbers, and
                            he fully appreciated the remarks which the Secretary had made about the
                            possibility of long range friction and difficulties if even a limited
                            repatriation was carried out. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister felt that
                            in spite of these facts, it would be beneficial to both Japan and the
                            United States if repatriation could be permitted for those persons whose
                            families had resided in the islands for generations, and on whose behalf
                            the Japanese Government felt that it could assume full
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>However, he continued, if, regardless of this, the United States should
                            still find it extremely difficult to permit even those persons to
                            return, then he had to point out that the question arose of
                            indemnification for those persons who were unable to return and who were
                            having difficulty in maintaining their livelihood in Japan proper.</p>
                        <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0423"/>
                        <p>The Secretary interjected that the records which the United States has
                            indicate that virtually all of the land in the Bonins was owned by the
                            Japanese Government, and that the inhabitants did not have any property
                            rights of their own. This question would be examined more closely,
                            however, and a more precise reply would be made tomorrow or later.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> pointed out that
                            according to the Japanese Government’s information, the inhabitants of
                            the Bonins had owned a number of parcels of land of their own, however
                            small, and that they also possessed fishing rights, which were
                            considered property.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, said the Prime Minister, he desired to bring up the matter of the
                            prohibition of nuclear tests. He was not, he maintained, acting on
                            instigation by any communist sources, nor with any intent of aiding the
                            communist side. The point was purely and simply a humanist one. The
                            Japanese Government has made very stiff recommendations to the Soviet
                            Government as well, asking them to end their nuclear tests. The Prime
                            Minister would like the Secretary to understand that the Japanese are
                            very serious about this matter and have presented their opinions to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Disarmament Committee not because
                            they might expect communist support but because of their own intense
                            feelings on the subject. He felt it most desirable, and it was his
                            fervent hope, that under United States initiative some arrangement could
                            be arrived at to prohibit all nuclear tests.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would like to take a few minutes to explain
                            the philosophy which underlies the United States position. In the first
                            place, we are fearful that too much concentration on the evils of atomic
                            warfare may give the impression that war is permissible if only atomic
                            weapons are not used. In the second place, as far as nuclear weapons are
                            concerned, we seek cessation of testing under certain conditions. One
                            condition is that any cessation or suspension of testing be adequately
                            supervised. The Soviet Union has indicated that it is willing to accept
                            supervision. I think, the Secretary said, the fact that the Soviet Union
                            now accepts supervision represents justification of the unwillingness of
                            the United States to consider suspension of these tests without
                            agreement on supervision.</p>
                        <p>There is still a danger, he went on, that the Soviets might make
                            elaborate preparations for carrying out tests in violation of their
                            agreement on the theory that to do so would give them enough knowledge
                            to get ahead of us. However, some risk in this field must be accepted,
                            and we are prepared to take certain risks. But we also believe that in
                            connection with any suspension of tests further measures are necessary
                            to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries and to put
                            an end to the build-up of such weapons by countries already possessing
                            them. Therefore we seek an agreement that after some agreed date no
                            further fissionable materials would be used by any <pb n="396"
                                xml:id="pg_396" facs="0424"/>nation for weapons. It will require
                            time to establish the procedures for supervising the undertaking that no
                            fissionable materials will be used for weapons. We are willing to accept
                            the suspension of tests while this machinery is being established, which
                            might be about one year.</p>
                        <p>This point we are now discussing, said the Secretary, is significant in
                            connection with some confusion which resulted from the President’s press
                            conference yesterday.<note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2">For the transcript of

                                    >Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>, 1957, pp. 468–470.</note> The
                            President was asked whether we would agree to suspend the tests without
                            some time specified after which fissionable materials would not be used
                            for weapons. The President answered no, said the Secretary, but
                            indicated that we would be willing to suspend the tests before the
                            actual date for the cutoff of the use of fissionable materials for
                            weapons. This did not mean, however, that we would suspend testing
                            without a firm agreement looking forward to the cutoff of fissionable
                            material for weapons.</p>
                        <p>For instance, continued the Secretary, suppose that June, 1958 is set as
                            the date for the suspension of tests. At that same time, we would begin
                            to install the system to insure that fissionable material would not be
                            used for weapons in the future. If it took one year to set up this
                            supervisory system, then the cutoff date for the use of fissionable
                            materials in weapons would be June, 1959.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe, the Secretary said, in the suspension of testing apart
                            from a larger attack on the problem. We are convinced that if properly
                            conducted the tests are not injurious to human health or genetics. The
                            tests have accomplished some important things. They have shown us how to
                            have clean weapons, and also how to have small tactical weapons so that
                            it would not be necessary in all cases to use mass destruction weapons.
                            If we merely suspended testing today it would mean that many countries
                            would shortly be able to make very big and very dangerous weapons but
                            unable, through testing, to make small and clean weapons. For instance,
                            country X, which I will not name, does not now have atomic weapons. If
                            that country is allowed to use fissionable materials for weapons but is
                            not allowed to conduct tests or experiments, the only kind of weapons
                            that country would be able to build would be the type most destructive
                            of human life. Therefore, we wish not only to stop testing but to stop
                            the use of fissionable materials which, if not tested, would be
                            extremely destructive.</p>
                        <p>We are hopeful, the Secretary said, that we shall accomplish much more
                            than was sought when the original proposals were made to stop testing on
                            an unverified basis. We ask, however, that the Japanese not try to hurry
                            us into an inadequate program, or create a public opinion that would be
                            satisfied by an inadequate program. We can accomplish much more if there
                            is understanding of the larger goal.</p>
                        <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0425"/>
                        <p>The Secretary asked the Prime Minister to treat as confidential what he
                            had said about the relationship between the suspension of testing and
                            the cutoff of fissionable materials for weapons; this had not yet been
                            explained to the American public or to our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> allies except for the United Kingdom and France.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then proposed that the group proceed to the larger meeting
                            where others were waiting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> remarked that he would like to use the 9:00 a.m.
                            meeting the next morning with the Secretary to iron out any difficulties
                            which might arise in agreeing on the final communiqué. The Secretary
                            agreed, and said that as much agreement as possible should be obtained
                            before he and the Prime Minister met with the President at 11:00 the
                            next morning.</p>
                        <p>The meeting then adjourned.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary opened the meeting and introduced his United States
                            colleagues present.</p>
                        <p>He stated that the United States recognized the extreme seriousness of
                            the economic problems which Japan faced. Japan, as a member of the Free
                            World society, had to find means for her growing population to live. The
                            Secretary had himself always considered that the chain of unfortunate
                            events beginning in the 1930’s had been largely the consequence of the
                            economic difficulties that descended on the world at that time. It was
                            important to avoid any repetition. He added <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398"
                                facs="0426"/>that there were elements of nationalism and
                            protectionism that had their influence, but the United States did hope
                            in these meetings and beyond to find a way to help Japan through its
                            economic difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister commented briefly on recent economic developments in
                            Japan. He expressed appreciation of the extensive United States aid to
                            Japan furnished since the end of the war. Japan had enjoyed a
                            satisfactory economic development principally owing to the aid received
                            from the United States. The purpose of his visit was to discuss ways and
                            means of establishing greater understanding and greater cooperation
                            between the two countries. He felt that increased understanding was
                            necessary. If he spoke candidly, it was only in the hope that this would
                            help toward the establishment of greater understanding.</p>
                        <p>The government of Japan had certain economic plans for the current year.
                            It aimed at a steady rate of economic development. It foresaw an
                            increase of 7.6% in production, an increase of 12.9% in exports and an
                            increase of 15% in capital investment. These increases would be more or
                            less in line with trends of recent years.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that until now production and prices had shown
                            favorable trends but investment had increased more than had been
                            expected. The result was that imports had greatly exceeded exports. The
                            Government had since March been obliged to increase money rates in order
                            to tighten import credit, and to restrain investment, with the object of
                            arresting the deterioration of the balance of payments position and
                            stabilizing the economy. The Prime Minister, however, added that he did
                            not wish to create the impression that the economic position in Japan
                            was generally bad. On the contrary he felt that it was on the whole
                            healthy and sound notwithstanding the adverse balance of payments
                            position which had recently developed.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister stressed that it was necessary to bear in mind, in
                            considering Japan’s position, both the balance of payments problem and
                            the need to provide for increased population. Japan was under the
                            necessity of increasing the volume of its foreign trade.</p>
                        <p>In pursuing the subject of Japan’s economy, the Prime Minister turned to
                            Japan’s trade with the United States. He said that as the United States
                            was the principal market for Japan, Japan had to concentrate its
                            attention on matters arising in the United States market. With reference
                            to Japan’s exports to the United States, Japan was endeavoring to take
                            into consideration the repercussions in the United States industries of
                            imports from Japan. Japan was trying to arrive at methods for orderly
                            marketing of its products in the United States and hoped it could expect
                            greater consideration from the United States particularly with respect
                            to movements in the United States toward restriction of trade with
                            Japan. The Japanese knew that the United States was a free trade
                            country. Other countries followed closely developments in the <pb
                                n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0427"/>United States. Any trade
                            restrictive developments in the United States were therefore
                            detrimentally influential in Japan’s trade relations with other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister hoped, with reference to the textile laws passed by
                            the Legislatures of Alabama and South Carolina that the United States
                            would see its way clear to correct the situation.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister indicated Japan’s gratitude for the consideration the
                            United States had given to Japan’s raw material requirements, having
                            special reference to the recently determined United States scrap export
                            quotes.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then addressed the subject of Japan’s trade with
                            Communist China. Japan, he said, regretted very much that agreement had
                            not been reached in the China Committee deliberations. Trade with China
                            was a matter of importance to Japan, which looked forward to a
                            “reasonable increase” in such trade. But he wished to stress the
                            importance which at the same time he placed upon cooperation among the
                            countries participating in the China Committee.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister stated in order to clarify Japan’s interest in trade
                            with Communist China, that the Government of Japan had no intention of
                            recognizing Communist China or of operating formal diplomatic relations
                            with Communist China. But Japan had certain “historical and geographical
                            connections” with China and it was imperative that Japan expand its
                            trade and economic relations with Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Japan had been asking for abolition of the China differential trade
                            controls and observed that events had pointed to the elimination of that
                            differential.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then commented upon his recent tour through Southeast
                            Asia. He had observed on his tour that the standard of living was very
                            low and that this led to political instability and to the existence of
                            various social problems. It created a fertile ground for Communist
                            infiltration. It was imperative that such Communist infiltration be
                            prevented by the granting of assistance to Southeast Asian development.
                            This would also be to the material advantage of Japan in the opening of
                            new markets for Japanese exports, and in the provision of raw material
                            sources. He said that the urgency of the problem was such that no time
                            should be lost.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that it went almost without mention that to
                            accomplish their economic development the Southeast Asian countries
                            would have to find “capital and know-how”. The questions presenting
                            themselves were therefore those of financing and the provision of
                            technical assistance for the development of Southeast Asian
                            resources.</p>
                        <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0428"/>
                        <p>During the preceding few years Japan had been receiving aid from the
                            United States to increase the level of productivity in Japan, aid in the
                            form of special or “offshore” procurement, and aid in the form of loans
                            and technical cooperation. This assistance from the United States had
                            been of extreme value to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister hoped that in view of recent economic developments in
                            Japan, as he had outlined them, including the deterioration in the
                            Japanese balance of payments position, the United States could consider
                            some further financial assistance to Japan in the form of loans.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then adverted to the program for the introduction of
                            youthful Japanese farm workers into United States farms for a short
                            period. This program was valuable to Japan for the economic boost it
                            gave the Japanese workers. But the program was also valuable in that it
                            furthered understanding between the Japanese and American people.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State in response to the Prime Minister’s observations
                            addressed himself first to the question of the textile laws, which he
                            said might be discriminatory. He observed that this legislation had been
                            enacted before Japan had instituted voluntary restrictions on its
                            textile exports to the United States. Since that time, efforts in the
                            states to obtain similar legislation had consistently failed. The United
                            States Government hoped to bring about repeal or de facto abandonment of
                            the legislation now on the books. If these hopes should not eventuate,
                            there could be action in the Supreme Court by the United States
                            Government seeking invalidation of these laws as being in violation of
                            the <gloss target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss> Treaty.</p>
                        <p>However, the Secretary was bound to observe that the court processes in
                            the United States sometimes produced unexpected results. For the time
                            being, therefore, it seemed better to work along the practical lines
                            which he had indicated.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of trade with Communist China, the Secretary said the
                            United States had always recognized that Japan should properly have a
                            considerable trade with Communist China, both as a source of raw
                            materials and a market for Japanese goods. The principal United States
                            concern was that trade with Communist China might be of a character
                            which would produce a rapid build-up of Communist China’s war potential.
                            China’s war industries at the present time were still in the infant
                            industry stage and China was almost wholly dependent on the Soviet Union
                            for military and war supplies. The danger in the area would be
                            substantially increased if China were to have an independent source of
                            war supplies.</p>
                        <p>The United States had the principal burden of military defense in the Far
                            East at the present time and felt that its views on the subject of trade
                            with Communist China should have been given more weight <pb n="401"
                                xml:id="pg_401" facs="0429"/>than they had been given in the recent
                            Paris deliberations of the China Committee on trade controls. However,
                            the action had been taken by the United Kingdom and some other countries
                            to abolish the “differential”. The United States realized that it would
                            be difficult for a country like Japan to accept restrictions on its
                            exports that were not accepted by other trading countries. The United
                            States hoped, however, that Japan would help insure that the quotas
                            established under the List II procedure would be small. The Secretary
                            added that the United States stressed the importances of such articles
                            as machine tools and electronic equipment. The United States felt quite
                            confident that large quotas in such items would substantially increase
                            China’s war potential without significantly increasing the total volume
                            of trade with Communist China. The Secretary explained that the United
                            States thought that the total volume of trade would not increase, as
                            measured by its value, because the amount of foreign exchange available
                            to Communist China was not large, and it was evident that the Chinese
                            Communist authorities would employ the limited amount of exchange they
                            could generate by purchasing, so far as possible, articles of high
                            strategic importance if the List II quotas should be increased. In that
                            event, he thought Japan’s trade with Communist China in less strategic
                            items would suffer. However, if Japan held down its exports of List II
                            articles to Communist China, it would not hurt Japan in total trade but
                            would on the contrary be offset by compensating sales of less strategic
                            items.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, Deputy Under Secretary
                            of State for Economic Affairs, spoke on the subject of Southeast Asian
                            economic development. He said the United States agreed with the Japanese
                            view of the necessity of promoting such economic development. In the new
                            United States proposal this year for <gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>
                            legislation, the United States Administration had asked the Congress for
                            the approval of funds to be available for the purpose of economic
                            development. In the subsequent two years it was hoped that such funds
                            would again be increased.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then turned to the
                            question of Japanese temporary agricultural labor in the United States.
                            He observed that in the preceding year the United States had approved
                            requests by American employers for permission to employ temporarily
                            1,000 Japanese farm youths in this country. The United States believed
                            that such a program when properly conceived was very beneficial. In
                            principle, the United States was in favor of it. But there had been
                            considerable concern in the United States as to the impact of the
                            Japanese and other such programs on labor standards in the United
                            States. The Department of Labor had also expressed concern about the
                            possibility of exploitation of such labor groups.</p>
                        <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0430"/>
                        <p>Because of these concerns, the United States was now in the midst of a
                            restudy of the Japanese agricultural labor program in order to determine
                            whether it would be appropriate to expand it. As the study was still in
                            progress, it was not possible for the United States to speak further on
                            the subject at that time.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was happy to know that the matter was
                            under study in the United States Government. He would like to extend his
                            previous remarks by drawing attention to the very beneficial effect the
                            program was having on United States-Japanese relations. Further, it was
                            well to bear in mind that the Japanese farm youths involved wrote
                            letters home to their families and friends in Japan and that this had
                            aroused greater Japanese interest in life in the United States. The very
                            fact that Japanese boys were accepted on American farms made the
                            villagers in Japan feel closer to similar communities in the United
                            States. He repeated that the program was very beneficial to Japanese
                            relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Commerce, reverting to the subject of the State textile
                            laws, confirmed the remarks of the Secretary of State. The United States
                            had made and would continue to make every effort to remedy the
                            situation. He said the Japanese in fact need not be too much concerned
                            because the laws in question were “dead letter” laws and had “little or
                            no practical effect” in view of their nonenforcement. In view of the
                            fact that efforts to pass similar legislation in other States had
                            failed, the Japanese would realize that the United States had
                            successfully blocked any effort to expand this type of legislation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName>, of the Export-Import
                            Bank, spoke on the subject of loans. He referred to the known record of
                            the Bank’s loans for the purchase of raw cotton. The annual loans had
                            run between $50 and $60 million each on cotton. He remarked in passing
                            that all of the loans had been paid on or before they had fallen due. He
                            said that the Bank had before it applications for loans for electrical
                            companies and various utilities. During the past year the Bank had
                            extended four credits for $38 million and two credits, for Japanese
                            airlines, amounting to $24 million. He said that the Bank had
                            applications in the amount of $97 million on hand for long-term loans.
                            These involved the electrical and steel industries. The problem had a
                            short-term and a long-term aspect. The Bank was then discussing the
                            immediate short-term problem. It was considering an increase of the
                            cotton loan from $60 to $80 million. He said that he was authorized by
                            his Board to advise the Prime Minister that this application would be
                            “looked upon favorably”.</p>
                        <p>The Bank was also considering applications for further agricultural loans
                            which would be discussed the next day with the advisers of the Prime
                            Minister. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> asked the
                            Prime Minister whether he agreed, from the point of view of Japan, that
                            it was preferable for the <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0431"/>Bank
                            to consider first the short-term problem or whether the Bank should give
                            more immediate consideration to the long-term. He remarked that the
                            total outstanding loans amounted to $124 million of which ½ was for
                            cotton.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister indicated that he would like an early decision on the
                            short-term projects.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WSC1">Waugh</persName> replied that the Bank
                            would be ready to give a decision before the Prime Minister’s
                                departure.<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2">Documentation regarding
                                decisions taken on this subject before <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                    >Kishi</persName>’s departure has not been found. For a summary
                                of the status of Japan’s subsequent relations with the Bank, see

                        <p>The Prime Minister turned to the question of Japanese vested properties
                            in the United States. He understood that these were valued at “some $100
                            million”. He understood that proposed legislation was before the
                            Congress which would make possible “some return” of these
                            properties.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State said that he was aware of the proposed legislation
                            and that he understood the matter would be very complicated. He
                            understood that a fairly large sum in the United States war claims
                            against Japan had been paid out of funds realized from German vested
                            assets. He would take careful note of the Prime Minister’s observations
                            and the United States would bear them in mind in working on this
                            legislation.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was happy to hear from Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> that the United States
                            Administration was requesting Congressional authorization of funds which
                            might be applied in Southeast Asian economic development. He had
                            recently made a tour of Southeast Asia in the course of which he had
                            placed certain ideas before his opposites in that area. He had sounded
                            out these Prime Ministers on the idea of an Asian development fund. He
                            realized that the idea was still very rough and would need further
                            development. He had given his suggestions on the subject to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> and hoped that
                            the United States would study them carefully.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State said that the United States attached great
                            importance to Southeast Asian economic development. It saw an
                            opportunity there for Japan to develop export markets as well as sources
                            of raw material. He observed, however, that to evolve the concept into
                            reality was a difficult and complicated affair. Nevertheless, the United
                            States believed the concept was basically sound and that it should be
                            pursued. The United States would study with “sympathy as to its purpose”
                            the proposal to which the Prime Minister had referred.</p>
                        <p>The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.</p>

                        <p>Pursuant to the Secretary’s instructions, I talked with Admiral <persName

                                >Kishi</persName>. I explained to Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> that the Secretary would be
                            meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> at 9 a.m.
                            and that we anticipated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> might inquire what the over-all extent of our
                            reduction in forces would be for the next twelve months. The Secretary
                            wanted Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s advice
                            as to what reply should be made in the event Mr. <persName

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that we
                            could inform Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> that we
                            would in the next twelve months reduce our existing force levels in
                            Japan by at least fifty per cent and that this figure would include the
                            withdrawal of all ground combat forces.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> began the discussion by
                            saying that he wanted to examine the contents of the draft joint
                            communiqué <note n="2" xml:id="d191fn2">Not found in Department of State
                                files.</note> this morning because there were a number of minor
                            questions requiring editing and a few suggestions of a major nature. He
                            said that he would like to have the communiqué considered as a whole,
                            rather than as a communiqué plus an annex. He wanted to revise the order
                            somewhat and divide the communiqué into two parts, incorporating matters
                            of United States-Japanese cooperation in the first part and matters of
                            defense in the second part. If agreeable to the Secretary, he would like
                            to re-edit some of the defense parts in order to meet more fully our
                            ideas. He wondered whether the Secretary would agree to this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he had no objection to the idea in principle,
                            and it would certainly be useful. It would be necessary to translate
                            that principle into a draft as rapidly as possible, however, and he
                            hoped the group could have it in final form by the time they called on
                            the President at 11 a.m. He asked whether the Prime Minister felt that
                            his thoughts could be put into words by 11 a.m. The Prime Minister said
                            that he thought that this was feasible, and he would proceed to explain
                            certain details. He thought that the first two paragraphs of the draft
                            should be considered the introduction. Part 1 of the communiqué should
                            begin with the 3d paragraph, and the previous annex should be put into
                            the text thereafter. The Prime Minister said that he thought that the
                            principles contained in the annex were of some importance and should
                            appear at an early stage in the document.</p>
                        <p>A number of minor changes in wording were then suggested and incorporated
                            in the draft.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then inquired whether it would be possible to dispense
                            with the words, “concerning the implementation” in the sentence which
                            read, “It was agreed to establish an intergovernmental committee to
                            study basic problems concerning the implementation of the Security
                            Treaty and to consult, wherever practicable, regarding the dispositiion
                            and employment of United States forces in Japan.” The Secretary replied
                            that he thought the sentence would not be very good in that form.</p>
                        <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0434"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said, however, that he would like to point out that in
                            the Japanese translation the included words would appear to limit the
                            function of the committee. He preferred to give the impression to the
                            Japanese public that this would be a high-level committee to discuss
                            basic matters.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would like to exchange ideas a little further
                            regarding the functions of this committee so that there would be no
                            future misunderstandings.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, the Prime Minister continued, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            had said that it would be difficult to change the Security Treaty
                            because that would require Senate concurrence. He understood and
                            appreciated that fact. He had no intent of using this terminology to
                            permit Japan to bring up problems beyond those intended for the
                            committee. His real purpose was simply to avoid giving the impression
                            that this committee would have very limited authority and
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that yesterday it had been considered that the
                            joint committee would handle two matters, consultation on the
                            disposition and employment of United States forces in Japan and making
                            reports to the United Nations. He thought that the language would be
                            better if it read, “study problems arising in relation to the Security
                            Treaty.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that he would be
                            quite happy with that, and the draft was so amended. The Secretary then
                            proposed that that part of the same sentence reading, “and to consult,
                            whenever practicable, regarding the disposition and employment of United
                            States forces in Japan” be changed to show, “including consultation”
                            instead of “and to consult.” What we are discussing, he said, is whether
                            this language would require consultation if the United States decided to
                            send its forces from Japan to Korea, Taiwan, Guam, etc. He was sure that
                            this was not intended, but he wanted to make sure the language was
                            right.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that this problem was taken care of by the
                            words, “whenever practicable,” since on such occasions the United States
                            might not find it practicable to consult.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he did not know whether he objected to this, but
                            he had thought that the matter of consultation concerned the disposition
                            and employment of forces in Japan and that it would not be necessary in
                            the case of forces being taken out. We want to reduce our forces, he
                            said, and have no particular objection to consultation regarding
                            that.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> interjected that
                            wording was not meant to cover such a withdrawal. The Secretary noted,
                            however, that as the draft was written, it would require consultation
                            whenever any forces were taken out of Japan. He had thought that by
                            consultation the Prime Minister had wanted to control the shifting of
                            forces within Japan. In the Security Treaty the United States was given
                            the right to <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0435"/>move its forces
                            about almost anywhere in Japan. Now we would agree not to exercise that
                            right except after consultation. If the Prime Minister were to bring up
                            the question of consultation on withdrawal of forces from Japan, that
                            would be a new question. The Secretary then proposed that the sentence
                            in question be further amended to read, “regarding the disposition and
                            employment in Japan by the United States of its forces.” This amendment
                            was accepted.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the most troublesome thing in Japan in
                            connection with the Security Treaty was the fear that Japan could be
                            gotten into a state of war involuntarily or without its knowledge in the
                            event that the United States took action somewhere without the Japanese
                            Government having known about it. This criticism is often heard in Tokyo
                            and that was his reason for discussing this matter. He thought that Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>’ wording was all right, but he wanted
                            him to understand the uneasy feeling in Japan. If he could feel assured
                            that in a major crisis the United States would inform Japan or give
                            Japan an opportunity to consult, he felt that he could go along. He
                            wondered whether this could be tacitly understood.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said, “Let me say that the United States feels that in the
                            event of any critical development in the Japan area which involved the
                            prospect of war we would want to maintain very close relations with your
                            Government. Obviously the successful prosecution of any war in that area
                            would call for, if possible, the good will and support of the people and
                            Government of Japan and we would not want in any way to act, unless it
                            was imperative, in any way that was abrupt or lacking in the normal
                            courtesy between friendly governments.” <note n="3" xml:id="d191fn3">See

                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was very happy to have the Secretary’s
                            thoughts and the wording was quite agreeable.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary handed the Prime Minister a draft paragraph which began:
                            “The United States welcomed information on Japan’s firm plans for the
                            buildup of her defense forces.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Asakai</persName> said that to use this wording would result in the
                            Prime Minister being questioned in the Diet as to why he had given
                            information or explained to the United States something that seemed
                            solely of concern to Japan.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> asked
                            whether this could not be interpreted as the Japan Defense Council plan.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> explained that
                            this plan had not yet been given to the Diet. It was then proposed that
                            the sentence be changed to read: “The United States welcomed Japan’s
                            plans for the buildup of her defense forces” and this wording was
                            accepted.</p>
                        <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0436"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then said he would like to discuss the paragraph on
                            strategic trade controls. He asked whether the following wording would
                            be acceptable: “The Prime Minister, while recognizing the importance of
                            exercising control in cooperation with other free world governments on
                            exports of strategic materials to those countries threatening the
                            independence of free nations through the extension of international
                            Communism, pointed out the necessity for Japan to expand its trade with
                            its neighboring countries. The President, while stressing the continuing
                            need to exercise such control, recognized that Japan must trade to
                            live.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he did not like this very much. He could not see
                            the need for stressing the expansion of trade with neighboring
                            countries. The draft later on goes on to say that Japan would seek a
                            high level of trade with the United States which is not a neighbor.
                            There could hardly be a greater need for Japan to expand her trade with
                            her neighbors than with the United States. This paragraph, the Secretary
                            continued, was not designed to cover the general problem of trade, but
                            what was a portion of the military problem. Trade was to be covered in a
                            later paragraph.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked if it would improve the matter to leave the
                            President’s statement in its original form.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked why there had to be such emphasis on neighboring
                            countries. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName>
                            replied that they meant Red China, but had wanted to avoid that
                            expression.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked why it was important to expand trade with Communist
                            China. Was there some miraculous virtue to be obtained in that way? Of
                            course, the Prime Minister was free to say anything he wanted to, but if
                            the United States accepted his statement in a joint communiqué it would
                            look as if the United States were withdrawing its opposition to trade
                            with Red China, which was using that trade to build a war potential
                            against the United States. The United States tolerates that trade, but
                            opposes it as evil. We could not put the Japanese draft in the
                            communiqué.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked whether the whole paragraph ought not to be
                            omitted. The Prime Minister inquired whether they should leave out the
                            references to neighboring countries.</p>
                        <p>It was then agreed to leave the first sentence of this paragraph which
                            contained the statement of the President unchanged and to replace the
                            second sentence, the Prime Minister’s statement, with the following
                            sentence: “The Prime Minister, while agreeing with the need for such
                            control in cooperation with other free world governments, pointed out
                            the necessity for Japan to increase its trade.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that he did not see the need for the word
                            “ultimate” in the phrase “residual and ultimate sovereignty” as applied
                            to the Ryukyu and the Bonin Islands. He said that he was not <pb n="409"
                                xml:id="pg_409" facs="0437"/>sure what was meant by this word and
                            that in the discussions leading up to the peace treaty the word
                            “residual” had always been used. At San Francisco former Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS1">Yoshida</persName> had welcomed the
                            Secretary’s statement on residual sovereignty, and the Secretary
                            preferred to keep that language.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he understood that the Secretary, himself,
                            had used the word “ultimate” at a press conference <note n="4"
                                xml:id="d191fn4">Reference is to the Secretary’s response to a
                                question at a news conference held April 23, when he said: “Now, as
                                you know, we have never ourselves sought to acquire the ultimate
                                sovereignty of those islands. That remains with Japan, and we do not
                                look upon this arrangement as a permanent arrangement. We do
                                believe, and I think the Japanese would agree, that nothing should
                                be done there which would so weaken the defensive posture of the
                                free countries as would encourage an aggressive move on the part of
                                the Communists.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Bulletin</hi>, May 13, 1957, p. 766)</note> and that the
                            Japanese had considered this a considerable improvement from their
                            standpoint over the word “residual.” They were not sure as to exactly
                            what “residual” meant, but they believed that “ultimate” meant that they
                            would get the islands back some day. They had been happy at that
                            statement and thought that there would be no objection to using both
                            words. If one word had to be left out, however, they would prefer to
                            keep “ultimate” in the text.</p>
                        <p>That showed how dangerous press conferences were, the Secretary replied.
                            Words used at informal press conferences did not have the same nicety
                            and legally binding effect as words carefully chosen in speeches
                            designed to portray concepts. There was no great difference, but no
                            thought that no bilateral change should be made in a subject which
                            concerned not only ourselves, but the other parties to the peace treaty.
                            Several of the allied governments had wanted to have Japan renounce all
                            claim to the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands. The United States, however, had
                            felt it best to have Japan retain residual sovereignty, with the United
                            States as the administering authority. These words have a certain
                            history. The formula used in the peace treaty was a compromise not only
                            with Japan, but with the other allied nations, and such a formal
                            understanding could not be changed on the basis of a press
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that he did not want
                            to argue the question of legal authority, but wanted to point out that
                            the word “residual” was not quite clear and did not include the idea
                            that the islands would eventually revert to Japan. When the Japanese had
                            heard the word “ultimate” used they had obtained a feeling that a new
                            possibility had opened. He would be surely disappointed if he had to
                            tell the people that the words were just the same.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he thought it was clear from the phrase, “so long
                            as the conditions of threat and tension exist in the Far East the United
                            States will find it necessary to continue to exercise its <pb n="410"
                                xml:id="pg_410" facs="0438"/>present powers and rights,” that we do
                            not consider that our authority in these islands is in perpetuity. On
                            the other hand, in a formal statement, the President and the Prime
                            Minister could not properly seem to change a formulation agreed upon by
                            almost 50 nations and to which certain nations such as Australia, New
                            Zealand and the Philippines attach great importance. It would not be
                            right to use lesser language in an informal attempt to make a bilateral
                            change in a multilateral undertaking. The United States could not do
                            this in a formal document.</p>
                        <p>The meeting then adjourned at 11:25 so that the Secretary and the Prime
                            Minister could call upon the President at the White House.</p>

                            complimented the Prime Minister on his speeches before the houses of
                            Congress the day before. The President had had breakfast with 40 members
                            of Congress, and they had unanimously expressed admiration for Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s presentation.</p>
                        <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0439"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister told the President that he had had lengthy
                            conversations with the Secretary of State, that things had gone
                            smoothly, and that they were about to make final the joint communiqué to
                            be issued between himself and the President,</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that he would proceed as rapidly as possible,
                            because he understood that the Prime Minister had to make a speech at
                            12:15. <note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">At the National Press Club; text is
                                    <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi></note></p>
                        <p>The Secretary then gave the President the draft communiqué, pointing out
                            that the first part had been agreed to by himself and the Prime
                            Minister, but that the second part was still under discussion. After the
                            President had read through the draft, the Secretary explained that they
                            were at that point considering whether to use the word “residual” or the
                            word “ultimate” in referring to Japan’s sovereignty over the Ryukyu and
                            the Bonin Islands. The Secretary pointed out that at the time of the
                            conclusion of the Peace Treaty with Japan he had stated, on behalf of
                            the United States, that Japan had residual sovereignty. Later on, at a
                            press conference, the Secretary had used the word “ultimate” in the same
                            context, and the Japanese would now like to see that word used in the
                            communiqué. The term “residual,” however, had been agreed to by a number
                            of Allied countries, and he thought that we should stick to that word
                            and not try to change bilaterally, in a statement issued by the
                            President and the Prime Minister, what had been multilaterally agreed
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what the difference was between the two terms.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he did not know, but that if the Japanese
                            found a difference, then it was important not to change the concept by
                            the use of the different word; but that if the Japanese found no
                            difference, then they would have no reason for wanting to use “ultimate”
                            rather than “residual.”</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> explained that to
                            the Japanese the word “ultimate” contained the idea that the islands
                            would one day revert to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President said that was what he understood by “residual,” that the
                            United States would exercise its rights for a period, and that the
                            sovereignty would then return to Japan.</p>
                        <p>He was glad, the President continued, that the paragraph had been put in
                            about the prompt withdrawal of United States ground combat forces. He
                            was definitely in favor of that.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that the truly important matter before them was
                            not the question of the text of the communiqué, but the purport of what
                            was happening. He thought that this visit and communiqué marked a major
                            change in the relations between the United <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412"
                                facs="0440"/>States and Japan. There would be immediate withdrawal
                            of our ground combat forces, and the establishment of a new
                            inter-governmental committee to consider the operation of the Security
                            Treaty. Up until now the Treaty had been unilateral, but the
                            establishment of the committee would go a long way towards it becoming
                            bilateral in its practical applications in spite of the difficulty of
                            formal amendment.</p>
                        <p>In these respects, the Secretary continued, our relationship is in the
                            process of transformation and this is one of the most significant visits
                            of foreign heads of government. This is being done deliberately, and
                            with our eyes open. You (the President), I, we all believe that the
                            important thing is to develop a relationship of real mutuality and real
                            cooperation and our best chance to do that is under the leadership of
                            the present Prime Minister. Fortunately at this period there is a Prime
                            Minister in whom we can have confidence and who has a genuine dedication
                            to the principles of the free world. As he had said to the Prime
                            Minister at dinner the night before, we were going as far as we could to
                            meet his legitimate demands. Some of his demands could not be met, but
                            this was not because we did not trust him, but because our own
                            legislation and our public opinion made it undesirable to move too far
                            too fast.</p>
                        <p>We are making a big bet on this gentleman, the Secretary said to the
                            President about Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, but it
                            is a justifiable bet in the interest of our future relations.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would like to make another point. I assure
                            you, he told the Prime Minister, that your visit is the beginning of a
                            constructive period. The Congressmen this morning were unanimous in
                            their praise of you. Now that you have achieved this personal trust we
                            can move constructively.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that he had pointed out to the Prime Minister, in
                            connection with the Bonin Islands, that security factors and the
                            inability of the islands to sustain many people meant that at most a
                            small number, perhaps 100 or 150, could be permitted to return. This was
                            as big a permanent population as the islands had ever had, he said,
                            since the other former inhabitants had been brought to the islands
                            before the war for military purposes. It might be better if we could
                            find some way to indemnify the former inhabitants. This was also the
                            position of our Department of Defense. The question would be the amounts
                            to be given and the source of the funds.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would study this matter sympathetically.</p>
                        <p>The President told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> that
                            he was very happy to have had this visit and that he thought it had been
                            very useful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> agreed that
                            the discussions had been tremendously important and he expressed his
                            deep appreciation to the President.</p>
                        <p>The meeting then adjourned, it being 12:00 noon.</p>

                        <p>The group met to continue consideration of the draft joint communiqué.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> opened the meeting by
                            proposing that the words “and ultimate” be deleted from the phrase
                            “residual and ultimate sovereignty.” He also asked that the phrase
                            referring to the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands, “The United States will find
                            it necessary to continue to exercise its present powers and rights” be
                            changed to read, “The United States will find it necessary to maintain
                            its present position.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that this latter phrase be changed to “continue
                            the present status.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Asakai</persName> replied that that would do.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked that the next sentence reading, “The United
                            States will take measures to improve the welfare and well-being of the
                            inhabitants of the Islands and to promote their economic and cultural
                            advancement” be changed to read, “The United States will continue its
                            policy of improving the welfare and well-being of the inhabitants of the
                            Islands and of promoting their economic and cultural advancement.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then said he would like to suggest the following
                            sentence regarding the Bonin Islands: <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414"
                                facs="0442"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The President expressed his readiness to give further
                                    sympathetic study to the possibility of the return to the Bonin
                                    Islands of a limited number of those Islanders who are now
                                    residing in the home islands of Japan.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he did not think that this would do. The Prime
                            Minister said that he would not insist on this appearing in the
                            communiqué, but he wondered whether he could understand that the United
                            States would be willing to carry out this study in view of the previous
                            day’s discussion.</p>
                        <p>As he had indicated, the Secretary said, as far as a return to the
                            Islands was concerned this could not be done for more than a very few
                            people. This would cause more trouble than would be worthwhile. The
                            Prime Minister had suggested indemnification in lieu of this and the
                            Secretary had said that he would explore this matter and communicate
                            further with the Prime Minister regarding both possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> then requested that
                            persons be allowed to travel back and forth between the main islands of
                            Japan and the Bonins for the purpose of visiting their family graves in
                            the Islands. The Secretary said that this would be included in the
                            study.</p>
                        <p>The phrase “special restrictions in certain states” was then changed to
                            read, “local restrictions” in connection with legislation discriminatory
                            against Japanese products. The phrase “early cessation of both the
                            manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons” was changed to read, “the
                            early cessation of both the testing and manufacture of nuclear
                            weapons.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked whether some reference might be made in the
                            communiqué to the fact that he had presented his ideas on economic

                            night before from the Japanese and there had not been time to make a
                            study. At the Secretary’s proposal, however, the sentence, “The views of
                            the Prime Minister will be studied by the United States” was added to
                            this section of the communiqué.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said he would like to strengthen the reference to the
                            threat of Communism by changing, “The objectives of international
                            Communism remain unchanged” to “international Communism remains a grave
                            threat,” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> asked
                            that this be changed to “major threat,” and this amendment was agreed
                            upon.</p>
                        <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0443"/>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked whether it was quite clear that the proposed
                            intergovernmental committee was not to deal with war plans, strategy,
                            etc., but with the political aspects of security arrangements. The Prime
                            Minister replied that this was his understanding.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked that the phrase, “intergovernmental committee to
                            study basic problems concerning the implementation of the Security
                            Treaty and to consult, whenever practicable, regarding the disposition
                            and employment in Japan by the United States of its forces” be further
                            changed to read, “intergovernmental committee to study problems arising
                            in relation to the Security Treaty including consultation, whenever
                            practicable, regarding the disposition and employment in Japan by the
                            United States of its forces.” This proposal was also adopted.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then said that he had been happy to hear that morning
                            the Secretary’s statement that Japan need have no reason to fear that
                            the United States would embark upon any project as a result of which the
                            Japanese might find themselves unexpectedly in a state of war; that in
                            the very remote eventuality of such a situation, that eventually itself
                            would mean that it was in the United States interest to maintain close
                            contact with Japan and that, therefore, the United States would expect
                            cooperation from Japan and Japan did not need to fear that close contact
                            would not be maintained. Now, continued the Prime Minister, it would be
                            desirable for me if I could understand that I might, when I see fit, say
                            that Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> had made such a statement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he saw no reason why that could not be done. He
                            would look over the transcript of the meeting and after verifying its
                            accuracy would give a quotation to the Prime Minister to use as he saw

                        <p>The Secretary said that if the question were asked it might be stated
                            that the intergovernmental committee would be set up in Tokyo and that
                            the American members would be our Ambassador and the senior American
                            military commander. After reflection, however, the Secretary withdrew
                            this latter statement and said that it might be better to answer that
                            the committee would be set up in Tokyo but that there had been no
                            decision as to its membership.</p>

                        <p>The Sec returned the call and the <gloss target="#t_SG1">SG</gloss> said
                            in the Girard case the Court granted certiorari on both petitions and
                            set it down for hearing July 8. So we ought to get it disposed of. The
                            Sec said fine. The <gloss target="#t_SG1">SG</gloss> will be arguing it.
                            The Sec said you appreciate the significance this has. It affects our
                            whole defense posture and collective defense arrangements all over the
                            world. R said something re conducting foreign affairs. The Sec said when
                            you permanently station troops abroad instead of on a temporary transit
                            you subject them to the jurisdiction of that state except as that state
                            may waive it. <gloss target="#t_SG1">SG</gloss> agreed. The Sec said if
                            they waive it under mutual waivers as here it is hard to see how such an
                            arrangement is not valid. If we cannot make such an arrangement then in
                            effect there cannot be any waiver by the country where our troops are.
                            It ends up they must have complete jurisdiction because apparently a
                            conditional waiver is no good. If we cannot honor it then there is no
                            alternative but to retain 100% jurisdiction. Therefore you cannot have
                            troops there. The <gloss target="#t_SG1">SG</gloss> said it is an absurd
                            situation and we have to make it plain to the Court so they see the
                            impossibility of it. The <gloss target="#t_SG1">SG</gloss> said we will
                            submit to State the draft of brief which must be filed July 1. The Sec
                            said he would like to see it.<note n="2" xml:id="d195fn2">Not found in

                        <p>Mr. Kaihara is having talks this week at the Pentagon about Japan’s
                            defense build-up plan. Mr. Kaihara went over with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJV1">Martin</persName> the subjects which he has been
                            and will be discussing with Defense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJV1">Martin</persName> asked Mr. Kaihara if
                            there was any likelihood that the three-year defense plan would be
                            revised to accommodate an accelerated build-up of the air force. Mr.
                            Kaihara expressed the conviction that the obstacles in the way of any
                            substantial increase over the goals set by the three-year plan were
                            practically insuperable. The defense budget this year is 101 billion yen
                            and an annual increase of 20 billion yen is foreseen. Additional funds
                            also are available, including carryovers from previous years. The
                            carry-over of all funds available for disbursement was 26 per cent in
                                <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1955 and in <gloss
                                target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1956 it was 24 per cent. There have
                            been five principal reasons for this large carryover:</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Government is naturally unwilling, Mr. Kaihara explained, to
                            raise appropriations over the present annual 20 billion increase when
                            there is such a substantial carry-over, representing an inability to
                            disburse previously appropriated funds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJV1">Martin</persName> commented that Admiral
                                Hoshina<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">A former <persName
                                    corresp="#p_IVASH1">Vice Admiral</persName>, Zenshiro Hoshina
                                was an <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> member of the House of
                                Representatives and an adviser to Prime Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> on defense matters.</note> had
                            a plan to build up the air self-defense force to a strength of some two
                            thousand or so planes. Mr. Kaihara said this was so and that the same
                            figure had been <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0447"/>recommended by
                            the United States Air Force. (Mr. Kaihara said one of the problems for
                            the Defense Agency has been to correlate the overly enthusiastic
                            recommendations of each of the three American services. For example, the
                            United States Army once recommended a strength of 300,000 for the
                            Japanese GSDF; our Navy recommended a strength of over 300,000 tons of
                            naval vessels for the <gloss target="#t_MSDF1">MSDF</gloss>.) Admiral
                            Hoshina, however, Mr. Kaihara explained, fails to comprehend the
                            practical problems. These practical problems, so far as the <gloss
                                target="#t_ASDF1">ASDF</gloss> are concerned, consist primarily in
                            pilot training, not in the acquisition of aircraft. There are not enough
                            suitable applicants for pilot training. All Japanese air force pilots
                            have to learn English well enough to understand the radio ground control
                            which is under American management. (The Japanese sought, Mr. Kaihara
                            stated, to institute a system whereby Japanese operators could work in
                            the control towers using their own language or alternatively to have
                            only the key pilots required to know English, but the United States side
                            would not agree.) Finally, there are not enough Japanese flight
                            instructors nor sufficient training equipment. A further obstacle to
                            rapid build-up is the lack of adequately trained ground crews. It takes
                            three years for mechanics to become experts.</p>
                        <p>One of the problems in equipping Japanese defense forces and looking
                            towards the development of modern weapons is the lack of adequate
                            security legislation in Japan. Mr. Kaihara said that he would be
                            discussing this matter in the Pentagon this afternoon and hoped to learn
                            the minimum the Pentagon requires for such legislation. He anticipated
                            that there would be difficulty putting the legislation through and that
                            is why it was necessary to know minimum requirements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kaihara said that the decision by the Defense Department to withdraw
                            the eight American <gloss target="#t_AAA1">AAA</gloss> Battalions from
                            Japan, a decision having been made without consultation with the
                            Japanese, had put the Defense Agency into a corner. The Defense Agency
                            had previously decided to create eight Japanese <gloss target="#t_AAA1"
                                >AAA</gloss> Battalions and the <gloss target="#t_JDA1">JDA</gloss>
                            would attempt to persuade the Japanese public that the American decision
                            to withdraw its <gloss target="#t_AAA1">AAA</gloss> Battalions had been
                            made on the basis of the Japanese decision. The only other conclusion
                            which would suggest itself to the Japanese people, as it had already
                            suggested itself to the Finance Ministry, was that the United States
                            Defense Department regarded antiaircraft guns as outmoded and no longer
                            useful. If this were the case, he asked, why should the United States
                            Army have been urging upon Japan for the past two years the creation of
                            antiaircraft battalions? In connection with the creation of these
                            battalions, Mr. Kaihara said that they would be a part of the Japanese
                            ground forces rather than a part of the air forces. He also expressed
                            the hope that in the future the United States would consult with Japan
                            before <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0448"/>making major decisions
                            of this nature. He intimated that the Japanese press had become aware of
                            the American decision to withdraw its <gloss target="#t_AAA1"
                                >AAA</gloss> units when the various installations concerned had
                            informed representatives of the Japanese special procurement agency that
                            the properties were to be turned back to the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJV1">Martin</persName> asked Mr. Kaihara
                            whether it might not be possible for the Japanese to develop guided
                            missile units to defend against air attack and pointed out that Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had stated in the
                            Diet some six weeks ago that not all nuclear weapons need to be
                            considered unconstitutional in Japan. This observation could apply to
                            purely defensive guided missiles with nuclear warheads. Mr. Kaihara
                            agreed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJV1">Martin</persName> asked him
                            about the rocket which a Japanese scientist recently had built and
                            tested, the Kappa. Mr. Kaihara said that a Dr.
                                <persName>Itogawa</persName> had developed this and that he and
                            Itogawa had gone to high school together but had had no contacts since
                            then. At the present time the Defense Agency was unable to have any
                            direct contact with Dr. Itogawa or his associates because these
                            scientists, like many others, entertained leftist ideas and were totally
                            opposed to Japanese rearmament. The Kappa was being developed only for
                            its use in the International Geophysical Year experiments. He said,
                            however, that following the Japanese custom, it was possible to use a
                            go-between and obtain some information.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Defense Agency desires to obtain from the United States, if
                            possible, two destroyers or one guided missile cruiser in <gloss
                                target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1958; Japanese funds are available. The
                            Japanese also plan to build two destroyers this year under the <gloss
                                target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> program. Admiral Southerland has told
                            Mr. Kaihara that he cannot say for sure whether a cruiser can be made
                            available. It appears that the Japanese were thinking of a 6,000-ton
                            cruiser from which to operate guided missiles (Navy “Terrier”) but the
                            Admiral told them that a 10,000-ton cruiser at a minimum would be
                            required for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese also desire to get one submarine as a practice target. They
                            have one old American submarine at the moment but it is in bad
                            condition. The Japanese are planning on producing one large submarine
                            and three small ones but this will take time.</p>
                        <p>With respect to military aircraft production, the <gloss target="#t_JDA1"
                                >JDA</gloss> has tentative plans to have the <gloss target="#t_P2V1"
                                >P2V</gloss>–7 built in Japan by Shin Meiwa in cooperation with
                            Lockheed. Sixty per cent of the parts will be obtained in Japan and
                            forty per cent imported from the United States. One plane a month can be
                            built after a lead period of one and a half years. They plan to build
                            altogether forty-two planes in three years. Actually they need a total
                            of sixty. Manufacture, if undertaken, would probably continue beyond
                            three years. The United States Navy has been trying to persuade <gloss
                                target="#t_JDA1">JDA</gloss> that the Japanese must have a capacity
                            to build for themselves anti-submarine aircraft.</p>
                        <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0449"/>
                        <p>Problems in connection with this plan are that Shin Meiwa must quadruple
                            its stock. The company, which is a successor to the Kawanishi Aircraft
                            Corporation, and which now overhauls United States aircraft at Itami Air
                            Base, has been earning no dividends. The Japanese Government will
                            therefore have to support the project.</p>
                        <p>There has been some discussion as to whether F–100 and/or F–104 aircraft
                            should be produced in Japan. The F–100, a heavy supersonic fighter
                            bomber (Mach 1.2), is manufactured by the North American Aviation
                            Corporation and would be manufactured in Japan by Mitsubishi. The F–104,
                            an interceptor aircraft of about one-half the weight of the F–100 and
                            much faster (cruising Mach 1.5, maximum Mach 2), would be manufactured
                            in Japan by Kawasaki in cooperation with Lockheed. The <gloss
                                target="#t_JDA1">JDA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>,
                            and MAAGJ all prefer the F–104. This suits Kawasaki perfectly because
                            its manufacture of T–33 jet trainers will come to a stop in the fall of
                            1958. It would like to start the F–104 project by that time but needs a
                            lead time of a year and one-half. In any event, three hundred planes in
                            the Century class will be built by 1962. Expenses have been calculated
                            on the basis of the F–100, the more expensive plane.</p>
                        <p>Mitsubishi is currently building the F–86–F day fighter. Problems have
                            been encountered because of frequent failure of subcontracted items to
                            meet specifications.</p>
                        <p>Japan wishes to obtain sixty F–86–D’s, all-weather fighter bombers,
                            between July 1 and December 31, 1958 through <gloss target="#t_MDAP1"
                                >MDAP</gloss>. Thereafter, an additional 120 planes should be
                            obtained by the Japanese in the opinion of MAAGJ, according to Mr.
                            Kaihara.</p>
                        <p>The United States currently operates twenty-four early warning radar
                            sites around the Japanese perimeter. The <gloss target="#t_JDA1"
                                >JDA</gloss> estimates the cost of operation of these sites at 10–15
                            billion yen annually. This is a figure equivalent to one-tenth of the
                            Japanese defense budget and therefore a substantial expense. The
                            Japanese are proposing that the United States and Japan split the cost,
                            but an effort is being made by the American military side to have Japan
                            absorb the entire expense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kaihara</persName> noted that in the meeting on Thursday
                            morning when <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>

                            lecturing from indicated only six Japanese divisions among its forces.
                            Mr. Kaihara pointed out that Japan also has three combat brigades which
                            have about the same fire power as a division though they have only
                            one-half the personnel. One more brigade is to be created. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJV1">Martin</persName> asked Mr. Kaihara what is the
                            present actual strength of Japanese GSDF, and he answered that it was
                            152,000.</p>

                            given an opportunity to put its views in the record; that although we
                            had somebody standing by in the anteroom, he was never called by the
                            Committee; and that a memorandum was being sent to Congressman <persName

                            Department’s position in the hope that it could be made a part of the
                            record. Upon inquiry as to where the Girard resolution stood, Mr.
                            Rayburn said they are planning to schedule it on the floor before the
                            Mutual Security Program since it might otherwise get tacked on to the
                            Mutual Security bill as a rider, which would be undesirable. Mr. Rayburn
                            also said that the Girard resolution would go through the Rules
                            Committee, but that as yet no one has asked for a ruling. He also said
                            it would be in the form of a Joint Resolution which would have to pass
                            the Senate and be signed by the President.<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3"

                        <p>The Secretary observed that the recent visit of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had been useful. Foundations had
                            been laid for a new and sounder relationship between Japan and the US.
                            Heretofore the US, under the Security Treaty which the Secretary had
                            himself negotiated, had played the predominant role in maintaining
                            Japanese security. The Japanese had acquiesced in this situation but
                            were now beginning to assume a more positive attitude. The US welcomed
                            this development.<note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">In a memorandum to
                                Reinhardt dated June 26, Joseph N. Greene, Jr., Deputy Director of
                                the Executive Secretariat, stated that <persName>Dulles</persName>
                                had asked that Reinhardt coordinate followup actions arising from
                                the <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> visit. (Department

                        <p>The Secretary stated that he had not been pleased with the passivity of
                            the Japanese. Having negotiated what had been hailed at the time as a
                            treaty of reconciliation, the Secretary had always wished to see the
                            Japanese assert themselves more. Now, under <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, more vitality was promised. US-Japanese
                            intercourse would now be bilateral.</p>
                        <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0456"/>
                        <p>The Secretary explained that we had not been able to satifsy entirely the
                            Japanese request for Okinawa. We had recognized it as belonging
                            ultimately to the Japanese, although while present world tensions
                            continued we were unable to abandon our rights there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Suhrawardy asked whether the question of retaining bases in Japan had
                            been discussed. The Secretary responded that the question had been one
                            of reducing forces rather than withdrawing from bases. He believed Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, who had not urged that
                            all US forces be withdrawn, was satisfied with our position. A bilateral
                            commission was being established which would henceforth confirm the
                            disposition of US troops on Japanese soil.</p>

                            report to the President on the termination of the Far East Command. He
                            said that a turnover ceremony had been held in Tokyo, in which <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> assumed the United
                            States responsibilities, and another had been held in Korea in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGGH1">General Decker</persName> assumed the
                            functions of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commander-in-Chief.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> said he
                            had also visited with the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> on Formosa, and had found him somewhat low
                            in spirits and quite worried over the effect that the passage of time is
                            having on the military and political situation of the Chinese
                            Nationalists. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName>
                            had also addressed the Ryukyuan legislature in Okinawa, reviewing the
                            progress that had been made since 1945 when they were destitute to the
                            present time.</p>
                        <p>He then went on to comment on two recent actions which he said were
                            tremendously helpful in the western Pacific. The first was the
                            suspension of Paragraph 13D of the Armistice; this is a great help to
                                <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0457"/>maintaining a proper
                            military posture in the area. The second was the issuance of an
                            Executive Order placing the administration of the Ryukyu Islands on a
                            sound basis. He said it was very good to have designated as High
                            Commissioner the same man who was in military command in the Ryukyus.
                            The President interjected that the principle of linking military and
                            civilian responsibility in a single individual is fundamental to his
                            concept of the functioning of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> also reported that
                            the land program is well under way in Okinawa—this is the program by
                            which all land not strongly needed by the military forces is returned to
                            the civilian economy.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of Korea; this portion of the memorandum is
                            scheduled for publication in Part 2.]</p>
                        <p>The President asked for <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName>’s comments concerning Japan, and recalled that
                            he has been proposing to pull out all of our forces. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> said the Japanese
                            have been slow in proceeding with their rearmament, using the
                            constitutional prohibition of forces as an excuse. They have
                            self-defense battalions, but these are not of combined arms size or
                            capability. We will soon be moving our ground combat units out. However,
                            we have some tremendous military depots there, supporting, for example,
                            the foreign military aid program through rebuilding of vehicles,
                            aircraft, etc. Primary reliance is on the Japanese but we have
                            supervisory personnel. The President said he could understand retaining
                            elements of this type. With regard to their Air Force and the Navy, the
                            Japanese are barely getting started. They have no A, C &amp; W, and this
                            must still be developed. The forces do not have a combat potential at
                            the present time. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> said he has been pressing the Japanese to
                            develop a defense council—somewhat like our <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss>—so as to have a policy instrument to deal with defense
                            problems. The President said the problem is a difficult one. We want to
                            keep Japan as a friend but at the same time want to lead the Japanese to
                            doing the things that are necessary for security in the western
                            Pacific.</p>

                            as Format E of the program submission which has been transmitted to

                        <p>2. The Military Assistance Program for FY 1959 proposed by MAAG, Japan
                            totals $84.3 million, distributed by Services as follows: Army, $9.3
                            million; Navy, $29.5 million; and Air Force, $45.5 million. This
                            compares with previous years’ programs as follows: <table rows="5"

                        <p>The program provides military “hard” goods such as weapons, ships, and
                            aircraft on both a grant aid and cost-sharing basis. The furnishing of
                            these items by the U.S. is premised, because of their complexity or long
                            production lead times, on the necessity of avoiding dangerously
                            protracted delay in the attainment of force objectives and acceptable
                            standards of combat readiness. The Embassy agrees with the assessment of
                            the Chief of MAAG that the probable consequence <pb n="431"
                                xml:id="pg_431" facs="0459"/>of a drastic reduction in current aid
                            to Japan at this time would be “a net lowering of the Japanese defense
                            capability” which “would seriously imperil the attainment of U.S.
                            security objectives in the Far East.”<note n="5" xml:id="d202fn5">The
                                quoted document has not been identified.</note></p>
                        <p>3. It is the considered judgment of the Embassy that the Military
                            Assistance Program for Japan for FY 1959, as developed by MAAG, Japan,
                            is consistent with U.S. political, military and economic objectives in
                            Japan. The Embassy recommends continued grant aid notwithstanding the
                            small percentage (1.5%) of gross national product (<gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>) which the Japanese are devoting at the
                            present time to defense and despite the Japanese official approach to
                            rearmament which has heretofore been characterized by <hi rend="italic"
                                >hesitancy,</hi> in view of the political liabilities involved; by
                                <hi rend="italic">austerity,</hi> in view of the manifold and urgent
                            demands for general economic betterment; and by an apparent <hi
                                rend="italic">lack of urgency,</hi> in view of the presence of
                            United States Forces in and about Japan.</p>
                        <p>4. It is generally recognized that there have been substantial political
                            obstacles to an increased force buildup and to the allocation of an
                            increasingly greater portion of the government’s financial resources to
                            defense. The Conservative Parties which have been in power since the
                            establishment of the initial defense forces in 1950 have all been
                            extremely sensitive to the basic Japanese repugnance toward war and
                            toward “the military.” There has been widespread fear that Japanese
                            rearmament could again involve Japan in a disastrous war. The Japanese
                            deep dread of nuclear weapons undoubtedly provides a psychological basis
                            for this fundamental force in Japanese politics. Coupled with this is a
                            strong national feeling on the part of the Japanese people that they
                            must have a stable and prosperous national economy before they can
                            support a defense force adequate to fill the legitimate defense needs of
                            their country.</p>
                        <p>5. The Embassy feels that the heretofore predominant negative aspects of
                            the official and popular attitudes toward the establishment and
                            strengthening of Japanese national defense forces are on the threshold
                            of a significant reappraisal by the Japanese themselves. Progress will
                            continue to be slow but the elements of a fundamental change are
                            present. While the Japanese program of rearmament for self-defense has
                            moved forward at a relatively slow pace since the initial reluctant
                            steps were taken in 1950, there is mounting evidence that sure progress
                            in certain fields is being made. In the past three years this has been
                            particularly reflected in the establishment and buildup to date of the
                            basic Self Defense Forces, Ground, Air and Maritime, and increasing
                            acceptance of their role in furthering the well being of the nation.
                            This program will undoubtedly be accelerated as <pb n="432"
                                xml:id="pg_432" facs="0460"/>the National Defense Council begins to
                            fulfill its role of delineating national defense policies which will
                            further legitimatize the achievement of military force goals.</p>
                        <p>6. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> is
                            providing definitive leadership in planning for a respectable buildup of
                            Japanese defense strength. Prior to his departure for the United States
                            in June he directed the development of and obtained cabinet approval for
                            both a basic national defense policy and an official defense plan
                            covering Japanese fiscal years 1958, 1959 and 1960. While the details of
                            the defense plan differ relatively little from the existing six year
                            plan, its significance lies in the fact that the new plan has received
                            “official” government approval while the previous plan remained for the
                            past three years as merely a Defense Agency “proposal.” The only major
                            substantive change is the provision for U.S.-Japan cost-sharing aircraft
                            production programs.</p>
                        <p>7. The new basic national defense policy reveals a further insight to
                            progress in official thinking on defense matters. The Government
                            publicly released the policy on May 20, 1957 in the following terms:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>8. Aside from the actions taken in anticipation of the visit as mentioned
                            above, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            visit to the United States is expected to provide a significant impetus
                            to the furtherance of Japanese defense preparations. Of particular
                            importance are the resultant expressions in the communiqué of Japan’s
                            adherence to the Free World and the intention of the United States to
                            “substantially reduce the numbers of United States forces in Japan
                            within the next year” and the “prompt withdrawal of all United States
                            ground combat forces.” Japan will no longer be able to take for granted
                            that it can relax in its own defense preparations because of the
                            presence of United States Forces. At the same time, however, it should
                            be pointed out, it would come as a devastating blow to them in their
                            adjustment to the new conditions if <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433"
                                facs="0461"/>the United States were also to concurrently drastically
                            reduce direct matériel and equipment assistance under the Mutual
                            Security Program. While this is an eventuality that they will have to
                            ultimately adjust to, United States military assistance is essential to
                            Japan for an indefinite period in the future.</p>
                        <p>9. Another encouraging and significant factor in the defense buildup of
                            Japan has been the success of the joint production programs for F–86–F
                            and T–33 aircraft which have been jointly financed by the U.S. and
                            Japan. This technique and these programs are not only serving to provide
                            badly needed modern aircraft for the defense of Japan but have provided
                            an attractive vehicle for Japanese financial contribution to the
                            country’s defense and the Government assuming greater responsibility in
                            the establishment and maintenance of an adequate defense production
                            base.</p>
                        <p>10. These defense developments under the present leadership contrast
                            sharply with the actions of the country’s leaders just six months ago at
                            the time of the Annual Defense Review in January, 1957. They considered
                            at that time that their political purposes would be better served by
                            approving a major tax reduction and appropriating increased funds for
                            welfare purposes than to proceed with the planned defense buildup under
                            the unofficial six-year plan which would require a substantial increase
                            in defense appropriations. Unfortunately, the additional defense
                            incentive which was anticipated as a consequence of the application of
                            the defense-share reduction formula contained in the April 25, 1956
                            exchange of notes was not realized inasmuch as the Government merely
                            increased the defense budget a relatively insignificant amount over the
                            previous year. This is a matter which is expected will be remedied in
                            the course of consideration to be given to the plans and budgets for
                            Japanese fiscal year 1958.</p>
                        <p>11. The impression has long existed in Japan that such defense efforts as
                            are exerted by the Government of Japan are the direct results of
                            pressure brought to bear by the United States. Considerable progress was
                            made in countering this impression in the course of these conferences to
                            consider the Japanese yen contribution to United States Forces in Japan.
                            The subsequent developments under Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> have helped materially to bring to the fore the
                            compulsions of Japan’s own role and responsibilities in its own defense.
                            It has become increasingly evident to the more forward looking leaders
                            in the Liberal-Democratic Party that the present strength of Japan’s
                            defense forces is inadequate not because the United States thinks it is
                            inadequate but because they themselves deem it insufficient in the
                            international situation that prevails. The best interests of both
                            countries will be best served by American officials avoiding any public
                            pronouncements that would <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0462"/>again
                            give currency to the impression that the efforts by enlightened Japanese
                            to further Japan’s defense policies and structure is the product of
                            American pressure rather than Japanese self-interest.</p>
                        <p>12. In the following paragraphs there is presented a review of the
                            highlights of the programs as proposed by MAAG-Japan and concurred in by
                            the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>13. Most significantly, a substantial portion of the proposed <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program ($44 million) is to be applied
                            to cost-sharing production programs for <gloss target="#t_P2V1"
                                >P2V</gloss>–7 and F–104 aircraft. Ammunition, which has been a
                            major <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> item, has been eliminated as
                            grant aid in the FY 1959 program. This entails a reduction of
                            approximately $61 million from the net requirements considered by MAAG.
                            MAAG considers that Japan will have the capability of producing and
                            financing this requirement. Emphasis is placed upon encouraging Japan to
                            assume increased responsibility for supporting her forces in
                            conventional weapons, rocket weapons, mortars, recoilless rifles,
                            radios, aircraft, ships, etc. No provision is made for Quartermaster,
                            Medical, Chemical, or Engineering items; for so-called “soft goods” or
                            for POL. Only a small quantity of advanced weapons has been included for
                            limited research and development purposes.</p>
                        <p>14. (a) <hi rend="italic">The Army program of $9.36 million</hi> will
                            provide support for ground forces in being and permit the expansion of
                            10,000 men to a total 180,000 man force in <gloss target="#t_JFY1"
                                >JFY</gloss> 1959. This will result in a force of six divisions,
                            four combined brigades, and essential combat and logistical support
                            forces. No provision has been made for conversion to Nike of the four
                            existing GSDF 90mm AA gun battalions or for the activation of four
                            additional 90mm AA gun battalions since there is no provision for these
                            in the “Six-Year Plan.” The Army program is most directly affected by
                            the ammunition cut-off decision since $61.1 million had been included
                            for this item in GSDF estimates.</p>
                        <p>(b) The bulk of the Army program ($9.2 million) is for initial unit
                            equipment, research and development items and “90 day war reserve”
                            equipment. This latter item ($8.3 milliom) includes tanks, light and
                            medium type; AA artillery weapons and field artillery pieces with prime
                            movers. MAAG points out that the Japanese are either not now capable of
                            furnishing them from their own resources or too long a lead time is
                            involved in local production because of their complexity.</p>
                        <p>15. (a) <hi rend="italic">The Navy program of $29.5 million</hi> will
                            provide (1) for the support of <gloss target="#t_MSDF1">MSDF</gloss>
                            Forces in being of 241 ships and small craft totalling approximately
                            90,000 tons, and 61/2 air squadrons and support planes, and (2) for base
                            buildup equipment for three airbases and five regional districts. Two
                            destroyers are also included in the 1959 program as loan vessels from
                            the U.S. Reserve Heet (at no cost to <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss>) with all cost of towage, rehabilitation, etc. to be borne
                            by the Japanese.</p>
                        <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0463"/>
                        <p>(b) $19 million is to be the U.S. 1959 share of the proposed cost-sharing
                            program for producing <gloss target="#t_P2V1">P2V</gloss>–7
                            (anti-submarine warfare) aircraft in Japan. This sum, together with a
                            diversion of $41 million from FY 1958 funds for U.S. supplied aircraft,
                            would make $60 million available as the total U.S. share in the joint
                                <gloss target="#t_P2V1">P2V</gloss>–7 program.</p>
                        <p>(c) $6.7 million is proposed for ordnance equipment for Japanese
                            constructed vessels and a little over $1 million is included for
                            electronic and communications equipment. While experience has clearly
                            shown Japanese ability to construct destroyers and other vessels
                            comparable to U.S. Navy vessels, it remains necessary, however, to
                            provide certain components under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            such as fire-control equipment, armament, electronics equipment,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>16. (a) <hi rend="italic">The Air Force program of $45.5 million</hi>
                            will provide for the support of 12 day-fighter squadrons utilizing
                            F–86–F aircraft; 2 all-weather fighter squadrons utilizing F–86–D
                            aircraft; 3 transport squadrons utilizing C–46 aircraft; 2 AA
                            battalions, 120mm; 1 conventional depot; 1 jet depot; 8 airbases; and
                            communications and electronics equipment for 24 <gloss target="#t_ACW1"
                                >AC&amp;W</gloss> sites, 20 airbases and for training purposes.</p>
                        <p>(b) The 1959 program includes $25 million for a cost-sharing program for
                            F–104 aircraft to be produced in Japan. This is in addition to $25
                            million proposed in the FY 1958 program. The total proposed F–104
                            program calls for 200 airplanes at a cost of $201.4 million. While this
                            program will start off on a 50–50% share basis, the over-all program
                            ratio will result in a 65-35% cost to Japan and the U.S., respectively.
                            (The Embassy assumes that if a Century-series aircraft other than the
                            F–104 is selected that the estimates will not be materially
                            changed.)</p>
                        <p>(c) $17 million is proposed for communications and electronics equipment
                            required for 9 <gloss target="#t_ACW1">AC&amp;W</gloss> sites to be
                            transferred from <gloss target="#t_FEAF1">FEAF</gloss> during 1959,
                            airbases and for training purposes. Approximately 75% of the equipment
                            for <gloss target="#t_ACW1">AC&amp;W</gloss> sites is already in place
                            and will be transferred with the sites.</p>
                        <p>(d) Present plans are for the activation of two all-weather fighter
                            squadrons in each of FY’s 1959, 1960, and 1961. The requirement for
                            F–86–D aircraft through FY 1959 is 77, of which 60 are in the approved
                            FY 1950-56 programs and 17 are in the FY 1958 program. No financing is
                            proposed for these planes in 1959. An excess of 86 F–86–F aircraft is
                            anticipated at the end of FY 1959. 66 of these aircraft however, will be
                            used to equip 3 tactical reconnaissance squadrons. The balance will
                            cover attrition needs.</p>

                            proposal to introduce dollar currency in the Ryukyu Islands in place of
                            the presently circulating B yen. We took occasion at the time Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> was in Washinton
                            during the recent visit of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> to discuss this question with the Ambassador. He
                            expressed fear of this action from the standpoint of our relations with
                            Japan and indicated that he thought the introduction of dollar currency
                            as the circulating medium in the Ryukyu Islands would be an unfortunate
                            move. We continue to share this view and to hope that a way can be found
                            to handle the Ryukyuan currency problem with a minimum of
                            disturbance.</p>
                        <p>Although we recognize that the introduction of the dollar currency in the
                            Ryukyus could have economic benefits and would have advantages from an
                            administrative viewpoint, our inability to agree is based on political
                            considerations. As you know, the reversionist sentiment in the Ryukyu
                            Islands results largely from agitation originating in Japan. Although
                            the United States Government policy on the need to retain our position
                            in the Ryukyu Islands was fully explained to the Japanese Prime Minister
                            while he was in Washington, it is to be expected that the Socialists and
                            the communist elements in Japan will continue to agitate. They will do
                            so because it is an issue which has political value, both from the
                            viewpoint of obtaining support from those elements in Japan who feel
                            strongly on the question and from the viewpoint of trying to frustrate
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and the
                            Liberal-Democratic Party in their efforts to establish a closer
                            relationship with the United States. It is anticipated that the
                            introduction of United States dollars in the Ryukyus would be used by
                            these agitators in an effort to demonstrate that the United States
                            intends to retain the Islands in perpetuity and does not seriously
                            intend that they will some day be returned to Japan. We continue to feel
                            that our required tenure in the Ryukyus will be more acceptable to the
                            Japanese and the Ryukyuans when actions taken do not provide ammunition
                            to the Socialists and Communists in cases where our purposes can be
                            achieved by a course not entailing such a result.</p>
                        <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0465"/>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Department of State concurs in the desirability of
                            avoiding debate in the United States Congress on the currency question
                            in the Ryukyu Islands because of the attendant publicity in Japan which
                            would result from such debate. Accordingly, we should like to suggest an
                            alternate procedure. This procedure would involve putting the B yen on a
                            more regularized basis in the following manner, it should be possible
                            through administrative action to indicate that the B yen is backed one
                            hundred per cent by the United States dollars available in the Ryukyuan
                            Foreign Exchange Fund and therefore is freely convertible into dollars.
                            It would appear also to be feasible administratively to indicate that B
                            yen are available to United States agencies and United States
                            individuals in the Ryukyus only through purchase with United States
                            dollars through the mechanism of the Ryukyuan Foreign Exhchange
                            Fund.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it would, of course, be desirable to replace, over
                            time, the present bills which are circulating in the Ryukyus. As you
                            know, they carry the indication that they are occupation currency. It
                            would seem relatively easy, however, to replace these pieces of paper
                            gradually, as the ones in circulation wear out, with currency more in
                            keeping with the present status of the Ryukyu Islands under the terms of
                            Article 3 of the Peace Treaty. Replacement of worn out bills is
                            presumably done in any case. Would not this course of action meet the
                            needs of the situation as described in your letter and in the report of
                            the Inter-Agency Technical Mission, without running the risk of
                            increasing the agitation from Japan for the reversion of the Islands to
                            Japan? With full dollar backing and free interchangeability with
                            dollars, the B yen would in essence become dollar currency, but without
                            the political difficulties which would accompany the introduction of
                            dollar currency.<note n="4" xml:id="d203fn4">In his June 19 letter,
                                Roderick had disagreed with the view that the introduction of a
                                dollar-backed currency would avoid the political disadvantages
                                foreseen in the introduction of dollar currency on the ground that
                                even dollar-backed yen would require Congressional authorization,

                            13 recommending an urgent survey of the number of people that the Bonin

                            Islanders whose property is being used by United States forces, and
                            possible visits by Japanese to the Bonins for the purpose of visiting
                            ancestral graves. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>
                            said that he had signed a reply to this letter last evening.<note n="2"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that the
                            United States does possess land records regarding property in the
                            Bonins, that the islands cannot provide livelihood for more than a few
                            people and that some arrangement for religious visits by Japanese could
                            probably be worked out, although past experience indicated that the
                            Japanese would use these visits for purposes other than religious. The
                            Admiral then stated that the Chiefs feel strongly that we are being
                            crowded in the Western Pacific; we have experienced difficulties
                            recently in the Philippines, Ryukyus, Taiwan, and Japan, and the only
                            place where we have had no trouble whatsoever is the Bonins. He
                            commented that the United States will need facilities for guided
                            missiles in this area and that the Bonins and the Marianas, although not
                            ideal, may well be the best available facilities for this purpose. He
                            also noted that the National Security Agency may have to withdraw
                            operations eventually from Japan and that the Bonins might be useful for
                            this. The Admiral concluded that he is reluctant to see us give up real
                            estate which may be very valuable for the United States and which is not
                            of any real value to Japan. He commented that no one had given any
                            thought to the form of government that might be necessary in the Bonins
                            if Japanese were allowed to repatriate; we might even be faced with a
                            situation where the leftist leaders would be taking office.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> emphasized that it is
                            important to make a survey to determine just how many people the islands
                            can support and also to examine the problem of possible compensation.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> stated that his reply
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> sought to give
                            current Defense information and thinking on the problems which had been

                            confidentially with me method by which “Japanese American Committee on
                            Security” could best implement provision in joint communiqué of June 21,
                            1957, that: “The Committee will also consult to assure that any action

                                >Fujiyama</persName> leaves for New York Sept 14. He stressed that
                            in terms of Japanese opinion it tremendously important establish that
                            Committee is real functioning body and that Washington agreements being
                            implemented. He suggested we discuss this in first meeting of Security
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>I said before introducing this into Committee I felt it preferable first
                            to have preliminary exchanges of views to properly prepare mutually
                            satisfactory solution. He agreed not to introduce it into Committee at
                            this juncture.</p>
                        <p>He then said <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> thinking in terms of an
                            exchange of notes between Embassy and FonOff which would restate
                            pertinent obligations assumed by US and Japan in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Charter and then state that any hostilities referred to

                            As indication of what FonOff had in mind, he gave me informal “piece of
                            paper” (transmitted in immediately following <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440"

                            he said was not official proposal but would convey line of Japanese
                            thinking.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Ohno</persName> I could not speak for
                            govt but in my personal view exchange of notes seemed appropriate way to
                            deal with problem.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized precise terms in which notes cast was very important since
                            under our Constitution the Executive Branch could not amend treaties
                            without appropriate Senate action. However if notes reaffirmed existing
                            obligations we had assumed under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Charter and parallel undertakings in other treaties to report to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council measures taken to resist
                            aggression, I believe we could find appropriate formula. I said that
                            Executive Branch would probably have to consult privately with Senate
                            leadership and Foreign Relations Committee to explain matter and avoid
                            misunderstanding as to what was contemplated.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_OK1">Ohno</persName> I would immediately
                            transmit informal paper he had given me but that if concept approved,
                            precise language would have to be looked at by us very carefully for
                            reasons I had set forth above.</p>
                        <p>From my talks with you while in Washington, I understood that you
                            believed best way to handle this problem was by exchange of notes as
                            indicated above, which would in effect be restatement of commitments we
                            have already undertaken with Senate approval. If you concur in this

                            situation on Okinawa and requesting some general statistics which can be
                            used in a statement to the Japanese on land utilization in the
                            Ryukyus.</p>
                        <p>The appreciation expressed by the Department of State for both the review
                            and reassessment of land needs in the Ryukyus by the Governor, <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName>, and his careful
                            supervision of this problem is a matter of satisfaction to the
                            Department of Defense. As a result of this review, the estimate of total
                            U.S. requirements was reduced from upwards of 56,000 acres to within the
                            52,088 previously authorized by the U.S. Congress. More than 300 acres
                            of land previously acquired were returned to the local economy between 1
                            July and 31 December 1956.</p>
                        <p>The United States has been following and will continue to follow the
                            policy of outgranting, for no cash compensation, all land included in
                            its holdings to the extent that this is compatible with U.S. utilization
                            and security requirements. On 31 December 1956, U.S. holdings of acreage
                            remaining arable were calculated at 7,505 acres. Farming was permitted
                            on 6,389 acres; this constitutes 85 per cent of the acreage held which
                            remains arable.</p>
                        <p>On 27 February 1957, the Deputy Governor announced the decision that the
                            Yonabaru airfield site will be utilized as a Marine helicopter
                            installation instead of a Naval airfield, thus obviating any necessity
                            for additional land acquistion at Yonabaru. In accordance with the most
                            conservative policy and economy in U.S. land utilization, a requirement
                            for additional land to build an airstrip on Miyako Island was
                            cancelled.</p>
                        <p>Reappraisal of the land situation resulted in greater land values as well
                            as lesser acreage needs. Based on these reappraisals, landowners are
                            being given, in lieu of annual rentals, a cash payment a great many
                            times more than the annual rent for the full use of their property. In
                            Fiscal Year 1957, funds in the amount of $2 million for resettlement
                            expenses incident to displacement of landowners, and $10 million for
                            long-term land acquisition were made available to the field commanders.
                                <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0471"/>Funds, in addition to the
                            amount previously authorized by the U.S. Congress, will be requested for
                            land acquisition previously authorized.</p>
                        <p>The keystone of U.S. land policy in the Ryukyus is to keep U.S. holdings
                            to an absolute minimum consistent with U.S. military missions in the
                            area. In the furtherance of this policy every effort is being made to
                            minimize requirements. Such efforts include joint service utilization of
                            facilities, multi-story construction, and location of facilities on
                            non-arable land. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName>, earlier this year, told the Ryukyuans that
                            this program is working “to the mutual benefit not only of the
                            landowners, but of the Ryukyuan people in general, as well as the United
                            States, and should usher in a period of greater prosperity and
                            increasing well being in the Ryukyu Islands.”</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense would hope that such of the above information
                            as may be provided to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> would be given in such a manner as to avoid any
                            connotation of obligation on the part of the United States to provide
                            the Government of Japan with reports on the activities of the U.S.
                            administration of the Ryukyus.</p>

                                Commerce reported to the Acting Secretary that from a practical
                                viewpoint it appears that it will not be possible to obtain
                                voluntary repeal of these laws for two or three years since a
                                reversal of the position of the proponents of these laws cannot be
                                obtained so soon after their enactment. The Acting Secretary urged
                                and it was agreed that the matter would be further explored by the
                                Commerce Department and would be reviewed again in the fall.<note

                            importance of committee and desire of both our governments to contribute
                            to its successful functioning. Foreign Minister in addition outlined his
                            views on principal tasks of committee: 1. to exchange views on security
                            problems to further mutual understanding; 2. to contribute to smooth
                            operation of Security Treaty; and 3. to study future adjustments of
                            security system consonance with wishes of peoples in both countries. In
                            connection with future adjustments, Foreign Minister stated that these
                            have to be handled with utmost precaution although committee cannot
                            escape facing problem.</p>
                        <p>In response to Foreign Minister, my statement (approved by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGFHJ1">General Smith</persName>) emphasized that
                            committee must first concentrate on making present treaty function
                            smoothly and that future adjustments take time and very careful
                            preparation. We took this line in order to discourage tendencies toward
                            early consideration of Security Treaty revision.</p>
                        <p>II. Committee then agreed upon working arrangements as formally proposed
                            by me. Working arrangements are as set forth in Embtel 413<note n="4"

                        <p>III. Foreign Minister and Director General of Defense Agency made
                            separate statements on second agenda item, problems arising from
                            withdrawal US forces. Foreign Minister, after expressing appreciation
                            for recent announcements of withdrawal First Cavalry and Third Marine
                            Divisions, requested information “well in advance” on details of these
                            withdrawals and on other further reduction of US forces due to impact of
                            redeployment in Japan. Foreign Minister explained such advance
                            information needed to permit Japanese Government to arrange for: <list>

                                    Foreign Minister concluded by proposing that program of
                                    disposition and redeployment US forces be communicated to and
                                    discussed by Committee on Security and that announcements on
                                    movement of US forces and release of facilities be made through
                                    mutual arrangements with view to avoiding public speculation on

                            </list></p>
                        <p>Defense Director General reiterated major points made by Foreign
                            Minister, stressing that transfer of defense responsibilities to Self
                            Defense Forces depended on three factors: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>He stated Japanese ground forces adequately trained and equipped to
                            assume reponsibilities due to US assistance but complicated domestic
                            procedures involved in stationing Japanese forces at appropriate
                            locations. He explained his staff instructed to develop plan for
                            phase-over but plan meaningless unless coordinated well in advance with
                            US plans for facility releases. Finally <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tsushima</persName> inquired about recent press reports implying
                            drastic changes in <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> policy (i.e.
                            reports that US had proposed Japan purchase military equipment from US
                            with yen, with yen proceeds being used by US to purchase equipment in
                            Japan for other Asian countries).</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SGFHJ1">General Smith</persName> and I then
                            commented on statements by both Ministers. I explained in broad terms
                            redeployment of US forces involved complicated considerations which
                            often made early notification to Japanese Government difficult. I also
                            questioned whether, as matter <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0479"
                            />of procedure, information should not be made available to Japanese
                            Government through established channel as soon as we receive it rather
                            than waiting for meeting of Committee on Security, as suggested by
                            Foreign Minister. Finally I gave Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tsushima</persName> assurances as set forth in Deptel 311<note

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SGFHJ1">General Smith</persName> first expressed
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName>’s regrets for
                            inability to attend first meeting and his hope to attend meeting in near
                            future. He assured Ministers that we are fully cognizant of impact on
                            Japan of US redeployment and of need for advance notification, and that
                            we intend to continue to provide information through existing machinery
                            as soon as it is available. He then described existing procedures for
                            providing information on facility releases and his hope to be able to
                            provide Japanese Government with information for facility releases as
                            soon as available and possibly by September 1. He also presented current
                            estimate on labor force reduction for next 10 months, i.e. 18,000 out of
                            current 126,000 master labor contract employees. Committee discussed
                            procedures for notifying Japanese Government of US redeployment plans.
                            During discussion, Japanese representatives stressed: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Desire for information and discussion in committee on

                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Agreement that individual movement of troops and facility
                                    releases should continue to be handled through established
                                    channels with as much advance warning as possible. I reiterated
                                    our intention to project our planning as far in advance as
                                    possible and to give information to the Japanese Government as
                                    soon as we receive it without withholding such information until
                                    meeting of committee. Because I felt Japanese presentation might
                                    carry with it possible implication that committee and not US
                                    would decide on US withdrawal plans, I emphasized that once
                                    decisions were reached by US on withdrawal of US units we were
                                    not in a position to alter them. I also expressed regret at lack
                                    of sufficient advance notice on announcements of First Cavalry
                                    and Third Marine Division withdrawals but pointed out that these
                                    announcements made quickly in order to give immediate substance
                                    to undertakings made by President and Prime Minister <persName

                            fine presentation problems involved in air defense system for Japan and
                            need to start working at once on this urgent matter. Gen <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> and I proposed this problem in
                            first instance be turned over to Joint Committee for immediate study of
                            technical issues involved.</p>
                        <p>After considering problem and discussing it with <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tsushima</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            stated strong desire for setting up new ad hoc group rather than using
                            Joint Committee. Japanese members of ad hoc group, which would
                            thoroughly study technical problems, would be named by <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJ1">Tsushima</persName> from Defense Agency and <gloss
                                target="#t_ASDF1">ASDF</gloss>, with Gen Genda (whose headquarters
                            are now at Fuchu) playing prominent role. US element would be designated
                            by Gen <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Japanese were obviously very concerned about political aspects this
                            problem in terms of domestic political considerations and Japanese
                            public opinion. After further discussion, it was agreed that ad hoc
                            group study would be held in strictest confidence on need-to-know basis.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> pointed out problem
                            involved not only technical questions but ultimately important security
                            and political issues which eventually <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453"
                                facs="0481"/>would have to be considered by Japan-American Security
                            Committee. In agreeing to above procedures for handling this important
                            security problem, Gen <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> and I
                            urged that Japanese members ad hoc group be named this week so work
                            could be commenced, and <persName corresp="#p_TJ1">Tsushima</persName>
                            assured us he would do so.</p>
                        <p>Later <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> expressed to me his
                            pleasure and appreciation over our consulting with him and his cabinet
                            associates regarding procedures to be followed in studying this problem.
                            He felt this in full keeping with spirit of his meeting with President
                            and Secretary and was another evidence that we took new era of equal
                            partnership seriously.</p>
                        <p>I discussed substance this message with Gen <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"

                            Treaty and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. Draft has been
                            approved by Secretary and is based upon informal Japanese paper sent
                            your 409.</p>
                        <p>Preamble emphasizes that provisions of Security Treaty and Administrative
                            Agreement are fully in accord with obligations contained <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. In view this approach appeared
                            desirable to have interpretations agreed by two Governments as guidance
                            for Committee on Security instead of having two Governments agree to
                            interpretations worked out in Committee. Latter course could have
                            undesirable implication that divergence of opinion had existed between
                            two Governments regarding relationship of Security Treaty and <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter.</p>
                        <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0482"/>
                        <p>Order of Embtel points A and B reversed in Dept draft because Embtel
                            point B is fundamental statement of relationship and thus proper lead-in
                            to remaining two points.</p>
                        <p>Changes made in Dept draft point B are for purpose of conformity with
                            precise language <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. Dept
                            considers exact adherence to Charter language of utmost importance in
                            order not to give any appearance of seeking to change existing
                            obligations through interpretation.</p>
                        <p>Point C changes were made because Japanese proposal differed from
                            language of Article 51 of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter in
                            several substantial respects such as use of word “terminated” and
                            reference to “any other organ of the United Nations”. In order avoid
                            future difficulties which could result from failing to adhere to Charter
                            language, such as disputes over what are the measures which must be
                            terminated, simple reaffirmation of intent to act in accordance with
                            provisions of Article 51 has been adopted. Furthermore reference has
                            been made to both Article I of Security Treaty and Article XXIV of
                            Administrative Agreement in view different wording of these
                            articles.</p>

                                        combined US-Japan defense capability for defense of Japan.
                                        This situation should be reviewed with Japanese in light
                                        Security Treaty and its importance to Japan as well as the
                                        US. Thus in discussing withdrawal US forces with Japanese
                                        officials it is considered important to point out that there
                                        does not seem to be any firm program on part Japan to
                                        increase its defense capability on a timely basis to
                                        compensate for reduction US forces by June 30, 1958.”</p>

                            <item>In our Para B, language used to refer “their international

                                members) permits of interpretation in this context that it refers
                                only to disputes between US and Japan and not to their respective
                                disputes with third countries. Accordingly, Japanese propose to
                                substitute “any international disputes in which they may be
                                involved”, which wording, they say, is uniformly used in our other

                                        <item>Since we are referring to Article 51 of Charter,
                                            Japanese say it is important to use language used in
                                            that article. Term “hostilities” is not found there and
                                            “armed attack” and “measures” are. (<hi rend="italic"

                                            Agreement, provisions of former are controlling and
                                            nothing in Administrative Agreement can go beyond terms
                                            of treaty. Therefore in light of further consideration
                                            reference to Administrative Agreement is unnecessary and
                                            undesirable. (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I assume

                        <p>1. Concur in amendments suggested paras numbered two and three Reftel,
                            With respect to former you may note that Japanese acceptance of
                            obligations under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter limited to
                            Article 2 but redraft proposed by <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            makes the point immaterial.</p>
                        <p>2. In para C of note suggest revision to read: “C. Measures which may be
                            taken under Article I of the Security Treaty in exercise of the right of
                            individual or collective self-defense against armed attack shall conform
                            to the provisions of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.” Revision
                            wholly consistent with Article 51 and you will note the right of
                            “collective self-defense” which is broader than present Japanese
                            conception. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> redraft has implication
                            that Article I of Security Treaty is limited to “armed attack against
                            Japan from without” particularly in light of comments on our draft
                            referring to provisions of Article I of Security Treaty and Article XXIV
                            of Administrative Agreement. Article I clearly contemplates measures
                            contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security in
                            the Far East in absence of attack on Japan. Believe Japanese point on
                            Administrative Agreement <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0488"/>well
                            taken since it deals merely with one of the situations contemplated by
                            Article I of the Security Treaty and reference to it may be omitted.</p>
                        <p>FYI Realize that Japan not inclined at this time furnish forces or
                            facilities in event hostilities not involving attack upon Japan. However
                            as Japan assumes fuller international responsibilities this situation
                            likely to change particularly if elected Security Council as now seems
                            probable. End FYI.</p>
                        <p>3. Accept suggested revision suggested in para numbered five Reftel.</p>
                        <p>4. With respect to para numbered seven Reftel desire simultaneous release
                            of exchange of notes in Washington. Will supply explanatory comment
                            later.</p>

                            areas and thus weaken free world position in Far East. <persName

                            of current US planning for reduction of forces in Japan. Using June 1,
                            1957 strength of 100,000 as reference figure, he estimated withdrawal to
                            amount 40–45,000 leaving approximately 55–60,000 US military personnel
                            in Japan on 30 June 1958. He emphasized projected strength figures are
                            tentative, subject to modification and cannot be construed as US
                            commitment. He also indicated considerable planning required before

                            schedule for balance of fiscal year. Japanese members of committee had
                            been previously impressed with classified nature such info, and it
                            therefore was extremely embarrassing to US side to have morning editions
                            of Japanese newspapers headlining a statement reputedly by a high
                            official in Washington on same subject.</p>
                        <p>This particular serious incident is one of many which have repeatedly
                            hampered efforts of our State and Defense Department personnel in Far
                            East area. At a point in time when our negotiations with Far East
                            countries are in delicate and critical state, ill-timed announcements
                            from Washington are not only embarrassing but they seriously prejudice

                                reductions in Japan would spur the Japanese Government into stepping

                        <p>Foreign Ministry today gave us following three questions on which they
                            said they would appreciate having urgent clarification.</p>

                            <item>“Measures which may be taken under Article I” in our draft can,
                                they say, refer only to measures taken by US since those are only
                                type of measures referred to in Article I. Both our first draft
                                (Deptel 501)<note n="3" xml:id="d218fn3"><ref target="#d212"
                                        >Document 212</ref>.</note> and their redraft were so worded
                                as to comprehend measures by Japan as well as by US. Their wording
                                accomplishes this by having reference to Article I tied to “armed
                                attack against Japan” instead of to “measures”. Japanese ask whether
                                our intent is to refer only to measures by US.</item>
                            <label>2)</label>
                            <item>Second question relates to use of term “collective self-defense”.
                                Use of armed forces under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter
                                must be justified either as individual self-defense or as collective
                                self-defense. If US forces are used in defense of Japan, in
                                association with Japanese forces, would we, Foreign Ministry asks,
                                consider such use as exercise of right of collective self-defense of
                                US, in meaning ascribed by US to that term in its mutual security
                                arrangements with other countries? Security Treaty deliberately did
                                not contain any obligation by US. It simply said our forces “may be
                                utilized”, nor did Japan make any commitment in relations to defense
                                of US. Ministry asks whether we intend to give this exchange of
                                notes implication of mutual security obligations which are in our
                                mutual security treaties with other countries. If so, Ministry said,
                                such an interpretation would be unilateral US interpretation since
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> could not legally, until
                                constitution is revised, assume obligation to help defend US.</item>
                            <label>3)</label>
                            <item>Third point relates to our omission of phrase “against Japan”
                                after “armed attack”. Ministry asked if it was our intention to draw
                                attention in exchange of notes to possibility of armed attack
                                against areas other than Japan. This would be departure from our
                                first draft <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0493"/>and from their
                                draft, both of which referred only to Japan or to Japan area. On
                                this point, we said that language was intended to cover all
                                situations which might arise under Article I of security treaty.
                                Their response was that from domestic political point of view, it
                                would do great damage to US-Japanese relations and their efforts to
                                work more closely with US in defense matters to call attention at
                                this time to possible unilateral use of US forces in Japan for
                                “maintenance of international peace and security in Far
                                East”.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I fully agree that we should not include
                            language which would change nature of existing agreements with Japan. On
                            other hand, it certainly does not serve our own interests to draw
                            attention to possible unilateral use by US of its forces in Japan for
                            purposes not directly related to defense of Japan area. Such action
                            would create major problems for us in immediate future. Furthermore
                            attack against Japan is at present only situation in which Japan’s
                            forces would be involved and hence in which Japan would be reporting

                                read together with implementing Administrative Agreement
                                contemplates measures by Japan as well as by US. Article XXIV makes
                                this explicit and Japanese argument set out in Embtel 626<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d219fn3"><ref target="#d214">Document 214</ref>.</note>
                                para 4B is to effect that Administrative Agreement cannot go beyond
                                terms of <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0494"/>Treaty. Tying
                                reference to Article I to “armed attack against Japan” either means
                                that Japan no longer agrees to use of US forces in Japan to
                                contribute in any way to “maintenance of international peace and
                                security in the Far East” or that US contemplates use of its forces
                                for this purpose not in conformity with Article 51 of the Charter.
                                Either meaning wholly unacceptable. In answer to Japanese question
                                our intent is to refer to any measures which can be taken under the
                                Security Treaty and such measures include action by Japan as well as
                                by US. In Japan’s own interest Japan may find it advisable to take
                                action to maintain peace in Japanese area or Far East area even
                                though hostilities do not involve attack upon Japan at
                                moment.</item>

                                “collective security” arrangement in light of third para of preamble
                                and Article IV referring to “alternative individual or collective
                                security dispositions” which contemplates “maintenance of
                                international peace and security in the Japan area”. This is
                                reinforced by Article XXIV of Administrative Agreement contemplating
                                “joint measures for the defense of” the Japan area. Measures taken
                                by Japan to these ends regarded here as measures of “collective self
                                defense” in no way inconsistent with Japanese constitution. Moreover
                                Japan by joining <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> recognized right

                                of Security Treaty and while we have no desire to embarrass <gloss

                                view, we cannot agree to language which would imply Japan unprepared

                                measures under Security Treaty inconsistent with its obligations
                                under Article 51 of Charter. Also do not desire Japanese people to
                                be misinformed as to scope of Japanese obligations already
                                undertaken as this might hamper development of spirit of

                                and should be consistent with Japanese political situation, the
                                following wording for para C of note: “C. Measures which may be
                                taken under the Security Treaty, including those which may be taken

                            <item><p>FonOff points out that our new wording of para C has
                                    grammatical, and therefore legal, difficulty. Our language seems
                                    to mean that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> measures taken under
                                    Article 1 of treaty are subject to <hi rend="italic">some</hi>
                                    end (i.e. “applicable”) portion of Article 51 of Charter. What
                                    we mean to say, FonOff believes, is that some of measures which
                                    may be taken under Article I of Security Treaty are subject to
                                        <hi rend="italic">all</hi> provisions of Article 51. FonOff
                                    foresees difficulty in explaining exact meaning of our new
                                    language of para C unless this question is clarified.</p>
                                <p>Although appreciating Department’s effort to meet their
                                    difficulties with our previous language, Japanese believe that
                                    our newest language, as it refers to “measures”, is too broad,
                                    since measures taken under Article I such as disposition of
                                    forces do not come within Article 51. Moreover, they say,
                                    general public, being unfamiliar with Charter, will not know
                                    what para C is about unless there is reference to “armed
                                    attack”.</p></item>

                            <item>In order avoid all these difficulties, and at same time give
                                expression to substance of our proposal, they have now taken
                                language of our second draft of para C (as given in Deptel 546)<note
                                    n="3" xml:id="d220fn3"><ref target="#d215">Document
                                    215</ref>.</note> and they have deleted “under Article I of
                                Security Treaty” as well as phrase “individual or collective”.
                                (Notwithstanding explanations given them, FonOff is still concerned
                                at possibility that inclusion of term “collective <pb n="468"
                                    xml:id="pg_468" facs="0496"/>self-defense” will give rise to
                                Diet questioning and debate as to whether <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                    >GOJ</gloss> has taken on new commitment. FonOff thinks
                                government could handle this but prefers to avoid it if possible.)
                                Their new proposal for para C thus reads “measures which may be
                                taken in exercise of the right of self-defense against armed attack
                                shall conform to the provisions of Article 51 of the United Nations
                                Charter.”</item>

                            <item>I think that, if we press them hard, Ministry will accept
                                inclusion of “individual or collective self-defense” in their latest
                                proposal in preceding sentence, provided we can meet point in para 2
                                above. On other hand, if Department believes latest Japanese
                                formulation contained in para 4 above safeguards our interests, it
                                would be very helpful to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> in
                                their handling of problem and therefore also in our interest for

                                51 of Charter or Article I of Security Treaty. Note Article 51
                                refers to “self defense if an armed attack occurs against a member
                                of the United Nations” rather than merely “self defense against
                                armed attack.” With reference Article I of Security Treaty, as
                                previously emphasized, contribution to maintenance of international
                                peace and security in the Far East is not necessarily contingent
                                upon an armed attack. In view of wording of Security Treaty, latest
                                Japanese proposal “self defense against armed attack” may imply
                                armed attack against Japan only.</item>

                                but urged one slight change which, they thought, expressed more
                                precisely meaning we intended to convey. This change is to
                                substitute “whenever” for “insofar as” in final clause. Their
                                reasoning was that our wording was susceptible of <pb n="470"
                                    xml:id="pg_470" facs="0498"/>meaning, and particularly so when
                                translated into Japanese, that provisions of Article 51 are <hi
                                    rend="italic">always</hi> applicable to some extent to all
                                “measures”. Their wording, they believed, made it clear, without
                                changing meaning that provisions of Article 51 of Charter applied
                                only to <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of measures contemplated by
                                Article I of Treaty, e.g. Article 51 would not apply to measures
                                short of hostilities or to disposition of our forces in

                            be a) the purchase by Japan under the reimbursable aid provisions of the

                            (instead of the furnishing of such equipment as U.S. grant-aid), b)
                            payment by Japan for such equipment in yen, and c) the use of such yen
                            receipts by the U.S. to procure in Japan items needed for Military

                            expressed the view that this proposal would not accomplish the goals of
                            inducing a higher level of Japanese defense expenditure, achieving a
                            sound and mutually satisfactory military relationship with Japan, and
                            developing and utilizing Japanese defense production facilities to meet
                            Asian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> requirements. The Embassy and
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> pointed out that a
                            substantial reduction or termination of grant aid would probably result
                            in unwillingness on the part of Japan to appropriate the larger sums
                            required to meet the force objectives of the six-year plan. They also
                            believed that the advantages of using yen instead of dollars for
                            reimbursable aid would be small and the disadvantages to the U.S. might
                            be substantial, since the Japanese would probably consider such a
                            proposal favorable only if assurance could be given that the yen used
                            for U.S. procurement in Japan would be additional to the amounts the
                            U.S. would otherwise spend for procurement in Japan. Furthermore, they
                            believed, Japan might demand a greater voice in the procurement for
                            which yen is used than it has with respect to current procurement. The
                            Embassy and <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> recommended that
                            the present gradual substitution of reimbursable aid (on a dollar basis)
                            for grant aid be continued and that <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472"
                                facs="0500"/>the current applicable U.S. policies be effectively
                            carried out by procurement in Japan of items and services required for
                            Asian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and U.S. forces in Asia when
                            such procurement is to U.S. advantage.</p>
                        <p>Since receipt of the April 30 message this proposal has not been

                            that Japan would be expected to proceed on the basis of reimbursable aid

                            military equipment for third countries in Asia. The Embassy reported
                            that this had caused great confusion, deep concern and considerable
                            press comment in Japan, leading to the querying of the Prime Minister,

                            Defense during his forthcoming visit.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent that this suggestion made unilaterally to the Japanese by
                            Defense officials has caused unnecessary confusion and concern in the
                            Japanese Government. This is particularly unfortunate in view of the
                            fact that the proposal has not been fully considered or approved by all
                            U.S. Government agencies concerned. Therefore, I believe that it is
                            imperative that the problem be brought to the attention of Assistant
                            Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> with
                            the request that the Defense Department cooperate fully in clarifying
                            the matter with Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName>
                            and that in future such proposals be appropriately cleared before being
                            presented to the Japanese.</p>

                                signed the letter, which is dated September 14. In it he reviewed
                                the matter along the lines outlined above and concluded: “In order
                                to avoid future misunderstandings of this kind, I urge that in the
                                future care be exercised by members of your staff in their
                                discussions with Japan officials and prominent Japanese citizens and
                                that they refrain from making proposals or suggestions of a basic
                                nature which have not been fully cleared within this Department and
                                other interested United States agencies.” The draft position paper,
                                enclosed with the letter but dated September 13, contained the
                                following paragraph: “Although certain individuals may have given
                                thought to the possibility of such an arrangement, no plan for the
                                replacement of grant aid by the sale of military equipment to Japan

                                procurement in Japan has been developed by the U.S. Government.”

                            prepared. I am taking this opportunity to respond to the subject matter
                            of your forwarding letter.</p>
                        <p>The talks which Jack Irwin and Charley <persName corresp="#p_SCH1"
                                >SHUFF</persName> had with Admiral Hoshina, Mr. Uemura and Mr.
                            Kaihara in June centered around the prospects of increased U.S. orders
                            for Japanese industry, at their suggestion. During these talks many
                            problems were discussed with Mr. Uemura, as a representative of Japanese
                            industrial interests, ranging from U.S. funds available for <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss>
                            to the balance of Japanese defense efforts, requirements and
                            capabilities. Various ways and means were also discussed which might
                            lead to a Japanese proposal for the solution of these problems. While
                            all of the subject matter was in consonance with the basic U.S. policies
                            for Japan, the framework of our discussions was such that no U.S.
                            proposal was or could have been made.</p>
                        <p>For some years now, you have shared our concern that Japan has not been
                            willing to contribute more than 1½% of its <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                >GNP</gloss> to its defense effort especially, as indicated in your
                            letter, when the future portends a continuous reduction in Military
                            Assistance appropriations. In view of our concern for the best interest
                            of Japan’s military effort, as well as other countries in a similar fix
                            (short of dollars), we proposed legislation, which Congress passed, that
                            will permit them to procure their military requirements with local
                            currency. This legislation would enable Japan to buy her military
                            requirements under Section 103(c) of the MSA as amended, for 1958,
                            should she wish to do so.</p>
                        <p>This concept as outlined in your letter is not new; it has been discussed
                            with staff members within the Department of State, <gloss

                            to the Department of State as a Department of Defense position paper for

                        <p>We believe you will agree that since U.S. legislation allows Japan, or
                            any other country for that matter, to procure military requirements for
                            local currency, it behooves the U.S. to utilize the generated local
                            currency to its best advantage. A yen fund could be used to procure
                            other <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Far East requirements in
                            Japan, thereby enhancing its military production base, providing jobs
                            for the thousands being laid off because of the withdrawal of U.S.
                            forces and introducing Japanese products to other Asian countries.</p>
                        <p>We know of no change in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> policy toward
                            Japan; however you are quite aware that there is a $500,000,000
                            reduction in MSA appropriations for FY 1958, and when the U.S.
                            apportions its limited resources to the most urgent world-wide defense
                            priorities, Japan, in view of its expanding economic and industrial
                            capability, can hardly expect that prior levels of U.S. aid will be
                            maintained. In view of these same considerations, Defense is seriously
                            considering the possibility of offering military assistance to Japan on
                            a reimbursable aid basis.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, it would appear to be particularly opportune when <persName

                            next week, to establish a climate that might elicit a Japanese proposal

                            they have been giving this matter serious consideration.</p>

                        <p>During the discussions in June with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, he raised the problem of land
                            utilization in the Ryukyus and suggested that the United States make
                            every effort to alleviate the land shortage. He mentioned specifically
                            the possibility of emigration of Ryukyuans to islands in the Trust
                            Territory of the Pacific Islands, such as Saipan or Tinian. The
                            Secretary replied that a close review of United States land requirements
                            was under way and that the possibility of Ryukyuan migration to other
                            areas, such as the Trust Territory, would be studied.</p>
                        <p>The Department has explored the suggested Ryukyuan migration to the Trust
                            Territory of the Pacific Islands and has come to the conclusion that it
                            is not feasible and should not be attempted. In pursuing this matter,
                            the views of the Department of the Interior, which has the
                            responsibility for administering the major part of the Trust Territory,
                            and the High Commissioner of the Trust Territory were sought. Interior
                            objected for the following reasons:</p>

                            65,000. With continued improvement in health and sanitation an even
                            greater increase may be expected in the immediate future, particularly
                            since the population is a relatively young one.</p>
                        <p>Of the 687 square miles of land in the Trust Territory only about half of
                            it is considered arable. Some islands are already overpopulated and with
                            the anticipated increase in population lands not currently in use will
                            be needed by the local inhabitants.</p>

                        <p>3. The stated policy of the Department of the Interior is to reserve to
                            the Micronesians, to the greatest extent possible, the development of
                            the natural resources and commercial opportunities of the Territory in
                            order that the maximum monetary return may accrue to them. Economic
                            resources in the territory are limited and any Okinawans brought into
                            the territory would be in direct competition with the Micronesians. The
                            latter have not yet acquired sufficient economic and commercial acumen
                            to withstand such competition. Not only would resentment arise but also
                            the policy of promoting the economic interests of the Micronesians would
                            be undermined.</p>
                        <p>4. The introduction of a minority element into the population at this
                            time could be expected to create social problems and to affect the
                            political development program. Migration of Okinawans for permanent
                            settlement would be regarded by the Micronesians as a direct threat to
                            the economic, social and political life that the Micronesians have
                            become used to since the war.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense, which administers Saipan and Tinian through
                            the Department of the Navy, continues to object to the entrance into the
                            Trust Territory of any foreign national on security grounds.</p>
                        <p>Additional objections foreseen by the Department are:</p>
                        <p>5. Under the Trusteeship Agreement the United States is obligated
                            “subject to the requirements of security and the obligation to promote
                            the advancement of the inhabitants” to “accord to nationals of each
                            member of the United Nations and to companies and associations organized
                            in conformity with the laws of such member treatment in the Trust
                            Territory no less favorable than that accorded therein to nationals,
                            companies and associations of any other United Nation, except the
                            administering authority.” Japan is a member of the United Nations and
                            privileges extended to Ryukyuans, who are Japanese nationals, might
                            create a precedent which all United Nations members could claim.</p>
                        <p>6. Almost 4,000 Ryukuan families (over 20,000 people) who formerly
                            resided in the Trust Territory would like to return there. It would be
                            almost impossible to permit a part of this group of people to move to
                            the Trust Territory without opening the door to endless agitation for
                            more migration. It would seem to be a case of all or none—and the Trust
                            Territory clearly cannot take all of them.</p>
                        <p>The Departments of State and Defense are continuing to examine
                            possibilities for Ryukyuan emigration to other areas.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense has reported on the review of United States
                            land requirements in the Ryukyus as follows: <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478"

                                <p>As a result of this review, the estimate of total United States
                                    requirements was reduced from upwards of 56,000 acres to within
                                    the 52,088 previously authorized by the United States Congress.
                                    More than 300 acres of land previously acquired were returned to
                                    the local economy between 1 July and 31 December 1956.</p>
                                <p>The United States has been following and will continue to follow
                                    the policy of outgranting, for no cash compensation, all land
                                    included in its holdings to the extent that this is compatible
                                    with United States utilization and security requirements. On 31
                                    December 1956, United States holdings of acreage remaining
                                    arable were calculated at 7,505 acres. Farming was permitted on
                                    6,389 acres; this constitutes 85 percent of the acreage held
                                    which remains arable.</p>
                                <p>On 14 August 1957, Commander Naval Operations directed Commander
                                    Navy Forces Japan to dispose of Yonabaru airfield site as excess
                                    land. In accordance with the most conservative policy and
                                    economy in United States land utilization, a requirement for
                                    additional land to build an airstrip on Miyako Island was
                                    cancelled.</p>
                                <p>Reappraisal of the land situation resulted in greater land values
                                    as well as lesser acreage needs. Based on these reappraisals,
                                    landowners are being given, in lieu of annual rentals, a cash
                                    payment a great many times more than the annual rent for the
                                    full use of their property. In Fiscal Year 1957, funds in the
                                    amount of $2 million for resettlement expenses incident to
                                    displacement of landowners, and $10 million for long-term land
                                    acquisition were made available to the field commanders. Funds,
                                    in addition to the amount previously authorized by the United
                                    States Congress, will be requested for land acquisition
                                    previously authorized.</p>
                                <p>The keystone of United States land policy in the Ryukyus is to
                                    keep United States holdings to an absolute minimum consistent
                                    with United States military missions in the area. In the
                                    furtherance of this policy every effort is being made to
                                    minimize requirements. Such efforts include joint service
                                    utilization of facilities, multi-story construction, and
                                    location of facilities on non-arable land. <persName

                            wherever possible. After careful consideration, the United States has
                            come to the conclusion that no exception should be made in the case of
                            the Ryukyuans to the general rule prohibiting migration into the Trust
                            Territory of the Pacific Islands. (2) The keystone of United States land

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said <persName

                            would like touch briefly on Japanese domestic political situation,
                            US-Japan trade, SEA development, return of limited number Bonin
                            Islanders, and Japan’s relationship with Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said on his return from US he
                            had carried out cabinet reshuffle, developed new policies and had
                            completed drawing up basic principles for FY 1958 budget. These steps
                            had been taken in hope present government would be able stay in power
                            for long time and thus stabilize Japanese domestic political situation.
                            Special Diet session would be convened November 1 for brief period at
                            which time he would explain new government policies. Following Diet
                            session, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said he hoped make
                            another trip to Southeast Asian countries including Australia and New

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> stated in present domestic
                            political situation primary problem was stabilization of economic
                            situation, particularly international balance of payments. Balance of
                            payments had deteriorated since last year and in late spring government
                            had been forced take measures to stabilize situation. These measures
                            included curtailment imports and “tight” money policy. As of now it
                            appeared steps taken by government have to some extent been
                            successful.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> went on to say another
                            problem in domestic situation was constitutional revision. More than
                            year ago Diet had passed law to establish constitutional revision
                            council. However, because of Socialist refusal to join, council had
                            delayed commencing operations. In July this year he had finally set up
                            council with members chosen from LPD and leading citizens in
                            nongovernmental activities. Council had met once during August, and he
                            hoped its final recommendations could be made basis for constitutional
                            revision.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> stated another problem was
                            matter of labor policy. Since war Japanese labor had been inclined
                            engage in “excesses” which had produced rather difficult situation. He
                            was attempting establish equitable relationship between labor and
                            management, and on this basis was planning take series of steps to curb
                            “labor excesses”. One characteristic Japanese labor problems was large
                            SOHYO organization, similar to American CIO, which was to great extent
                            controlled by leftist elements. Within SOHYO organization there was
                            large group government and public service unions including Japanese
                            Teachers Union which could command majority. Unfortunately SOHYO
                            organization placed primary emphasis on political objectives. Every year
                            SOHYO engaged in national strike campaign in March timed coincide with
                            end of Japanese fiscal year. During SOHYO campaign last spring
                            government took firm position in weeding out those persons who violated
                            labor laws. Government believes labor should confine activities to
                            economic objectives, but political action by labor required government
                            counter-measures. He said SOHYO is complaining against disciplinary
                            action taken by government and he felt firm measures of government are
                            gradually weakening SOHYO power. SOHYO still claims it will launch
                            nationwide strike in October, but there is reason to believe fall
                            campaign will not have support of people.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said government wanted take
                            corrective action against SOHYO within framework existing laws. In past
                            there had been tendency ignore full implementation existing laws for
                            fear labor would accuse government of unduly repressive measures. Among
                            other things government determined to stop check-off system union dues
                            for government workers which will be done within existing legislation.
                            In addition government also studying possibility amendment labor laws
                            and when this study completed appropriate action will be taken.</p>

                        <p>With regard to Socialists, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            stated this party divided into two—left wing is supported by SOHYO and
                            other by more conservative labor elements. In views of divided
                            situation, Socialists do not have strength to wage long struggle against
                            government. Partly in order compensate for its relative unpopularity and
                            distract people from domestic issues, Socialists are sending two
                            different missions to USSR and US.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> stated JCP was also divided
                            in [<hi rend="italic">to</hi>?] such an extent it is now finding
                            difficulty in convening party convention. Government is now prosecuting
                            certain financial sources of JCP in hope of depriving Communists of
                            large part of funds. It suspected that JCP receives financial assistance
                            from Communist China and USSR and government is making careful study of
                            this problem.</p>
                        <p>On subject of US-Japanese trade, <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> said it is axiomatic Japan must trade to survive,
                            and he emphasized US is Japan’s largest market for finished goods as
                            well as source raw materials. Any disturbance in this market would have
                            serious effect on Japanese economy. He pointed out Japanese imports from
                            US exceeded exports by considerable margin, thus placing strain on
                            Japanese dollar reserves. Unfortunately, there were various movements
                            within US to restrict Japanese imports; these movements constitute
                            irritant in US-Japan relations. At same time he expressed appreciation
                            for friendly and firm attitude taken on this problem by US Government.
                            Nevertheless, he expressed particular concern since next year is
                            off-election year in US and feared that certain pressure groups might
                            try to bring about restrictions. He stated Japan doing its best to avoid
                            over concentrating on certain types exports to US which were competitive
                            with US domestic industries. Japan was doing its utmost to provide
                            orderly flow exports to avoid further aggravation of situation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said restraints in Japanese
                            imports by US would also seriously affect Japan in its trading with
                            other countries since it would encourage other countries to do likewise.
                            For this reason, from Japanese viewpoint US restrictions meant in effect
                            restrictions throughout world which would immediately affect Japan’s
                            economic life and its ability to earn living.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said Japanese business
                            circles believed it might be desirable establish nongovernmental
                            consultative committee composed of US and Japanese businessmen to iron
                            out differences and take proper preventive measures to prevent these
                            differences from coming to head. He understood such committee had been
                            established between US and Canada. He said govt is carefully studying
                            matter and he felt strongly such committee could make valuable
                            contribution in alleviating problem.</p>
                        <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0510"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> went on to say that,
                            although it might be small matter, Japanese businessmen were trying to
                            fix price and quantities of exports to US to avoid creating problems in
                            American market. He understood these efforts might run counter to
                            anti-trust laws in US. He realized these laws could only be amended by
                            legislation, but wondered if possibly they could not be so administered
                            as to allow Japanese businessmen to stabilize in this way exports to
                            US.</p>
                        <p>Turning to subject of SEA development, <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> stressed need for social and political stability
                            in this area. These countries must have firm economic basis if they are
                            not to fall prey to Communists. He emphasized he would like to do his
                            utmost to this end. Important problem for these countries was to provide
                            necessary capital and technicians to develop their resources. During his
                            visit to Washington he had set forth cerain thoughts on SEA development
                            fund and technical training centers, and had requested US to make study.
                            He was well aware some capital flows into these countries through World
                            Bank and US economic assistance but, perhaps because of Communist
                            propaganda, these countries are suspicious of receiving aid from one
                            country and lack proper understanding of US goodwill. At same time, this
                            area is not attractive for investments from private capital. It was his
                            opinion that possibly satisfactory solution would be some kind of
                            multilateral arrangement on mutual basis to provide necessary investment
                            funds. With regard to technical training centers, he stated he believed
                            Japan could establish these, but would be compelled to depend to great
                            extent upon US financial assistance for necessary capital to develop
                            economies of these countries.</p>
                        <p>On Bonin Islands he said these former residents had been moved out of
                            islands at end of last war, and for long time have been very anxious to
                            return. He pointed out US has already permitted certain number of
                            residents of Caucasian origin to return. In his talks last June with
                            Secretary latter had indicated US might be able give some favorable
                            consideration to problem. Govt was not asking for return of all of
                            residents but if US would agree to return of limited number, govt would
                            be very careful in selecting appropriate individuals and would be ready
                            to provide whatever financial assistance needed in paying for return
                            journey and getting them established. The fact that only persons of
                            Caucasian origin had been allowed to return was very sensitive matter
                            and had caused real resentment in Japan as form of racial
                            discrimination. He sincerely hoped US would agree to limited return
                            since this issue was real impediment to long term development of
                            stronger Japanese-US relations.</p>
                        <p>On Japan–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said it was unfortunate in this
                            part of free world that two countries were at loggerheads. This was type
                            of situation which could be exploited by Communists. He emphasized he
                            was doing his best normalize relations and that he was deeply concerned
                                <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0511"/>because of 700 unfortunate
                            Japanese fishermen who were being detained in Pusan. These fishermen
                            were captured by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> for alleged
                            violation of the so-called <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            line and imprisoned for varying periods. Even when their sentences were
                            completed they were still detained by Koreans. He said this was serious
                            domestic problem. Govt had conducted series of talks with <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> authorities which have now bogged down
                            because Koreans always demanded additional Japanese concessions. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has conceded as much as it could. Big
                            question in negotiations has been property problem. Japan agreed to use
                            US interpretation of Article IV of peace treaty as basis for settlement,
                            but at last moment <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> changed its mind
                            and question has been left pending. He hoped US would study problem and
                            give whatever assistance it could to bringing about successful solution
                            by providing appropriate advice to both sides.<note n="2"

                        <p>I expressed deep appreciation for PriMin’s clear and frank exposition. I
                            assured him US very conscious of Japanese economic situation
                            particularly necessity to correct present imbalance in international
                            trade payments. US was very sympathetic in problems Japan faces with
                            regard to exports to US and I was pleased to hear Japanese are striving
                            for greater diversification in their US exports. I pointed out, however,
                            that US also has similar problems with other countries. With regard to
                            SEA development, I said a special committee in US Govt is studying
                            problem. On Bonin Islands I said I was well aware Ambassador was very
                            conscious of difficulties and he was doing everything possible to assist
                            in solving problem. On Japan–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            relations I emphasized this problem was of course primarily matter
                            between Japan and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. However, since
                            PriMin was requesting good offices of PE, we would do best we could to
                            help if appropriate occasion presented itself and where it would not in
                            any way be infringement on internal affairs of two countries.</p>

                                >Telegram 819 from Tokyo, September 17, marked “For <persName

                                indicated that the telegram was stimulated by news reports from

                                the Japanese request. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files,
                                294.94C22/9–1757)</note> which I sent to <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Walter Robertson</persName> a few days ago about the return of a
                            limited number of Bonin Islanders. This, as you know from what <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said yesterday, is an extremely
                            sensitive issue insofar as the Japanese are concerned, particularly
                            because of its racial discrimination aspects. While the Navy has been
                            strongly opposed to the return of any Bonin Islanders of Japanese
                            descent, I earnestly hope we can work out a solution involving the
                            return of at least two to three hundred Islanders. We have many
                            difficult issues with Japan. With respect to some of them, such as
                            Okinawa, there is nothing we can do at this juncture to meet the
                            Japanese view. However, with respect to the Bonin Islanders, I do feel
                            strongly that we can, without jeopardizing our basic and fundamental
                            interest or security, be forthcoming enough to find reasonable
                            solutions.</p>
                        <p>This is very important, because the Bonin Island problem is a very
                            contentious issue which has deep psychological overtones which cannot
                            but affect our long-term relations with Japan. I place this at the top
                            of the list of problems on which I think we are in a position to and
                            should, act at once.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, the war criminal issue should be settled now, although I
                            definitely rate its importance as less than the Bonin Island problems.
                            We are in a bad posture to be the only country that has war criminals
                            still in prison. I would hope we could find solutions for both Class A
                            and Classes B and C along the lines of the latest Japanese proposals
                            which I have fully reported to the Department.</p>
                        <p>Solutions to these problems are, I believe, not only in our own
                            self-interest in our efforts to align Japan with us and the free world,
                            but also they will strengthen <persName corresp="#p_KN1"

                            domestic house in order. It is particularly important at this time to do
                            what we can to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            (as President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said he
                            wished to do), since he will be facing national elections in the coming
                            year. And the results of these elections, just as in the case of the
                            recent German elections, will have a vital bearing on where Japan goes
                            in the coming critical period.</p>
                        <p>As contrasted with the immediate situation and looking at Japan in the
                            long-term, I am convinced that whether Japan will remain solidly aligned
                            with ourselves and the remainder of the free world depends primarily on
                            the vital trade issue. <hi rend="italic">By the very nature of the
                                economic facts governing Japan’s life, its long-term foreign policy
                                must in the final analysis be dictated by Japan’s over-all economic
                                needs</hi> and whether the free world will permit her to earn her
                            living through trade. If Japan is convinced that its economic life
                            depends on cooperation with the free world, then other problems we have
                            in the vital fields of security and defense will fall into line.
                            Although we will obviously have some difficult problems in these fields,
                            I am sure they can be adjusted on the basis of give-and-take which fully
                            takes account of our own self-interest. The trade problem is a tough
                            long-term issue that will have to be continuously worked on in view of
                            the pressure of various groups in American industry. Therefore, it is
                            all the more important that we now try to eliminate or reduce serious
                            and major irritants in our relations with Japan where we can do so, as
                            in the case of the Bonin Islanders and the war criminals matters.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I need not mention how very important I think it is for our
                            whole position in Southeast Asia and Japan that we come up with some
                            really constructive and imaginative ideas as to how we can best assist
                            in Southeast Asian economic development. Time, I fear, will work against
                            us in that critical part of the world unless we can do something really
                            constructive on economic development there.</p>

                                208</ref>.</note> the Department of Defense has completed a study to
                            determine whether a limited number of former residents of the Bonin
                            Islands could be repatriated from Japan. The conclusions drawn as a
                            result of this survey are set forth below.</p>
                        <p>We know that in the 1930’s these islands supported an agricultural
                            population of between 1,000 and 2,000 people. This was at the end of a
                            long period of development which began with the first European settlers
                            in the nineteenth century. It can be assumed therefore, on the basis of
                            arability alone and aside from all other considerations, that there
                            exists an eventual capability to support considerably more than the
                            present 176 civilian inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>To determine an order of magnitude of support capability a number of
                            factors must be weighed. Setting aside for the moment the security
                            aspects of these islands we find the following to be true. The land has
                            returned to nature and is jungle, except for the small amount tilled by
                            the present inhabitants. There is no housing. Existing roads,
                            waterworks, electricity, and other facilities are sufficient only for
                            present requirements. Under existing conditions the 176 native
                            inhabitants make a poor and minimum satisfactory living. They live in a
                            harmony which is largely attributable to their common background and
                            interests and the machinery of government required is negligible.
                            Therefore, we find that in order for these islands to support any
                            increase in their population there will require the expenditure of time,
                            investment of capital, development of government organization and
                            services, and social readjustment in ratios which place a variable
                            limitation on both the size and success of any immigration. For these
                            reasons it is extremely difficult to set a definite figure upon the
                            number of additional population hypothetically supportable by the Bonin
                            Islands. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            estimate of 200–300 is perhaps as good as can be made for a repatriation
                            over a period of one to two years. This presupposes adequate financial
                            support. A more accurate figure would depend upon detailed surveys
                            requiring the expenditure of funds not now available or, under the
                            circumstances, justifiable.</p>
                        <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0515"/>
                        <p>The study reviewed the security aspects of the U.S. occupancy of the
                            Bonin Islands. The review confirmed our present position. In brief,
                            present world conditions, the state of military technology and our
                            strategic assessment make it essential that we refuse consideration of
                            further repatriation for the foreseeable future. The withdrawal of our
                            forces from Japan serves only to increase our need for this posture. We
                            have previously outlined to you the present and contemplated future uses
                            which require this control and the reservation of all useful land for
                            military purposes. As you know the requirements of U.S. law restrict
                            knowledge of some of the installations envisaged to the minimum who need
                            to know. In carrying out its responsibility for protecting information
                            this Department has concluded that the present policy of exclusion must
                            be maintained. We consider that the presence of the 176 Bonin Islanders
                            now resident in the islands is a justifiable exception to this policy.
                            These individuals, descended from the original European settlers, were
                            pro-U.S. throughout World War II and were returned to the Bonins shortly
                            after the war to save them from the persecution they were undergoing in
                            Japan. This repatriation occurred before the present military
                            requirements developed. These islanders continue to be pro-U.S. and even
                            are seeking U.S. citizenship. They offer no security problem.
                            Nevertheless, it is doubtful that they would have been returned to the
                            Bonins if present needs had been known at the time. There is, of course,
                            now no humane alternative to their continued residence. Except for the
                            present islanders the presence of Japanese civilian visitors or
                            residents, however innocent their intentions, would inevitably lead to
                            difficult security problems and attendant irritations and prejudice to
                            our relations with Japan. Therefore the Department of Defense strongly
                            opposes the repatriation of any civilian to the Bonins, now or in the
                            foreseeable future. Repatriation will be acceptable only concurrent with
                            the release of the islands from U.S. control, which, of course, should
                            not occur until world conditions have changed considerably.</p>
                        <p>Since it is not feasible to repatriate any of the Bonin Islanders from
                            Japan it would seem proper to assist Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> in disposing of the problem in a
                            manner politically palatable to the Japanese people. Toward that end, it
                            is recommended that the Departments of Defense and State, and other
                            interested agencies, consult further with respect to compensating former
                            residents whose private landholdings have been used or appropriated by
                            U.S. forces. In view of the fact that these landowners were originally
                            evicted by the Japanese government, it would seem reasonable for Japan
                            to share the cost of such compensation. No study was made of the amount
                            of land or money this would involve, or of the existence of any funds
                            from which compensation might be paid.</p>

                        <p>It is recommended that the above conclusions be communicated to the
                            Japanese government in such manner as you desire as soon as possible,
                            together with a reiteration that so long as conditions of unrest and
                            tension exist in the Far East, the U.S. must adhere to present policies
                            with respect to the Bonin Islands.<note n="3" xml:id="d228fn3"

                                    requirements which you described.” The letter noted that
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> did agree, however, “that we
                                    would study the matter of indemnification for the displaced
                                    islanders.” <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> also
                                    informed Irwin that the Department of State did not agree with
                                    Defense that Japan should share in the cost of compensating
                                    former residents whose property had been used or appropriated by
                                    U.S. forces. “Such a suggestion would nullify the major
                                    political objective we are seeking to obtain through
                                    compensation which is to eliminate or at least to greatly
                                    diminish the pressure for repatriation.” (Department of State,

                            <item>General Discussion of American-Japanese Relations by the Secretary
                                of State and the Japanese Foreign Minister</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary opened the meeting by noting that he had met the Foreign
                            Minister at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in New York, and that
                            it was a great satisfaction to welcome him to the Department of State.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> knew the Secretary’s
                            special interest in Japan, dating from the time when he had negotiated
                            the Treaty of Peace with Japan. The Secretary had been confident then
                            that Japan would develop into a truly great country in the Far East and
                            the Western Pacific, great in the sense of contributing to the welfare,
                            peace and stability of the area. That confidence has been proven
                            justified. The United States wishes to contribute in any way possible to
                            achieve further results along these lines.</p>
                        <p>The recent visit of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, who was at that time also Acting Foreign
                            Minister, had been very useful, the Secretary continued. He had received
                            a cordial note from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            introducing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName>, and he
                            wanted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> to carry back
                            his thanks. He would be happy to continue through Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> the good relations maintained
                            with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, and
                            asked that the talks today be in the same spirit of frankness and
                            friendship as those held with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that it was a great honor to meet Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> in Washington. He had ended a 35-year
                            career as a businessman to enter the Government as Foreign Minister, and
                            it was significant, and would be remembered by him, that this discussion
                            was being held as a starting point in his new career. He had been a
                            close friend of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> for over
                            20 years, and had always hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> would someday become Prime Minister. When that
                            eventuality came to pass, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> strongly urged him to accept the post of Foreign
                            Minister, he had accepted because he knew that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> wanted a man who agreed with him.
                            They wanted no duality in foreign affairs, but the closest teamwork. The
                            fact that he had become Foreign Minister did not mean that there would
                            be any alteration in Japan’s foreign policy, but on the contrary he was
                            resolved to pursue the objectives decided upon between the President and
                            the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>As the Secretary knew, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName>
                            continued, the new <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> Cabinet
                            had taken office on July 10 of this year. The reorganization of the
                            Cabinet had given it added strength, and one factor in that strength was
                            the successful visit which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> had made to Washington, during which the
                            cornerstone had been laid for close cooperation with the United States
                            in various fields of foreign relations. Japan relied on its relations
                            with the United States as the keynote for its <pb n="490"
                                xml:id="pg_490" facs="0518"/>relations with other areas, such as
                            Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Japan’s policy was to solve problems
                            and work for adjustments through the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>On the domestic side, there were two problems which the Foreign Minister
                            wanted to mention, labor and education. A Cabinet Council had been set
                            up to deal with labor matters, and Mr. Ishida, former Chief Cabinet
                            Secretary who had accompanied Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> to Washington, had been appointed Minister of
                            Labor. Basically, the labor problem in Japan is one which the present
                            Cabinet can solve. Public opinion supports the Cabinet, as was indicated
                            by the reaction to the Government’s action in discharging striking
                            workers on the Government railroads several months ago. To a certain
                            extent, at least, the Government can succeed in its labor program.</p>
                        <p>In the field of education, the Government is determined to move ahead in
                            spite of strong resistance from the Japan Teachers’ Union. Steps will be
                            taken to improve the general administration of education as well as its
                            content. Within the context of wider relations between the United States
                            and Japan, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> desired to
                            bring up the question of education in the Ryukyu Islands, as he had
                            twice been requested to do by the Minister of Education. The election of
                            a communist sympathizer, if not an outright communist, as mayor of Naha
                            had indicated, he believed, that there is an unhealthy and dangerous
                            drift in the Ryukyus, for which education is partly, at least,
                            responsible. The Japanese Government is taking forceful measures in
                            education in Japan, and believes that it would be a welcome first step
                            if some participation in education in the Ryukyus could be returned to
                            Japan. This would also satisfy some of the aspirations of the people of
                            the Ryukyus, and remove some of the sting arising from the fact that the
                            islands are still under military government.</p>
                        <p>It might be difficult, the Foreign Minister admitted, to accomplish this
                            from the administrative point of view, but it would be a first step to
                            assure Japan of the eventual restoration to it of the civil
                            administration of the Ryukyus. This would be a great help to United
                            States-Japanese relations and would be beneficial to the people of Japan
                            and of the Ryukyus. He asked the Secretary to give thought to this
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>The people of Japan, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName>
                            continued, are looking forward to the results of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> talks. The new Joint Committee on Security
                            has already met twice, and both the Government and the people are well
                            satisfied. The recent exchange of notes between our two countries
                            linking the Security Treaty to the United Nations has had a very
                            favorable impact. Another result of the talks has been the rapid
                            withdrawal of American ground combat forces. Various problems have been
                            discussed in the Joint Committee on Security, and it <pb n="491"
                                xml:id="pg_491" facs="0519"/>has been favorably received by the
                            Japanese people. The military participants in the Committee have been
                            very helpful, and he wanted particularly to express gratitude for the
                            part played by <persName corresp="#p_SGFHJ1">General
                            Smith</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said, however, that there were two matters which
                            concerned the Japanese people and on which they were still waiting to
                            hear the results of the <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            talks, the repatriation of the Bonin islanders and the release of war
                            criminals. The details of the talks on these matters had not been
                            disclosed, but it was known that they had been discussed and there was a
                            strong desire for their settlement. It was especially disturbing that
                            persons of pure Japanese ancestry were excluded from the islands, while
                            persons of partly Caucasian ancestry had been allowed to return. The
                            people and Government of Japan would greatly appreciate it if some means
                            could be found to allow some repatriation. It would not be necessary for
                            all to go, or for all the islands to be opened, but they hoped for the
                            admission of at least several hundred on this occasion.</p>
                        <p>The League for Acceleration of Return to the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> said, strongly
                            desires to have some persons return to the islands, and he wanted to do
                            anything that he could to remove this problem from the field of
                            American-Japanese relations. The League has 2,000 members, but the
                            Foreign Minister did not know how many of these would actually want to
                            return to the islands if the opportunity were offered. He believed that
                            the very fact that they were forbidden to travel to the Bonins might be
                            a principal cause of their agitation. Twelve years have elapsed since
                            the end of the war, many of the people are elderly, and perhaps only a
                            handful would return. If two or three hundred could be allowed in, as a
                            first increment, that might solve this petty situation.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of war criminals, the Foreign Minister continued, the
                            number was not large, but the fact that there are any at all, twelve
                            years after the end of the war, is a sore spot. He realized that it
                            might not be possible to dispose of all Class A, Class B and Class C
                            cases at once. Although the United States has suggested that Japan set
                            up a new Commission to review Class B and C cases, Japan already has
                            such a Commission. It would be undesirable to set up a new Commission,
                            because to do so would undermine the trust and confidence enjoyed by the
                            present Commission, and Japan would therefore like to use the existent
                            Commission for the review of the war criminal cases. If it proved
                            difficult to reduce the sentences of the war criminals to the time
                            already served, and thus free them entirely, could not the system of
                            supervision and surveillance over those on parole be terminated? The
                            important thing, the Foreign Minister said, was to move ahead, step by
                            step, however slowly, and not to stand still. If this can be done, the
                            people will be impressed with the results of the Washington talks. If
                            these problems regarding the Bonin Islands and the war criminals <pb
                                n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0520"/>can be solved, then overall
                            United States-Japan relations will improve at the same time. Some
                            problems are well handled through established diplomatic channels, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> emphasized, but as
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs he was interested in trying to solve these
                            particular cases in a way which would strengthen relations between the
                            two countries.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister asked whether the Secretary would like to comment at
                            this point, or whether he would prefer Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> to complete his entire presentation first.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he would be glad to comment on the matters
                            already raised, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName>
                            might then resume his presentation.</p>
                        <p>He was very glad, the Secretary said, that the Foreign Minister had
                            presented frankly and without reserve the political problems facing his
                            country, and that he had expressed the desire to work together for our
                            mutual advantage. He was very happy that the Japanese Government
                            intended to deal vigorously with the labor problem in Japan. He had
                            felt, from his own knowledge, that the labor situation was dangerous and
                            the unions apt to be infiltrated by communist agitators. We know that
                            the communists try particularly to get control over labor unions. We
                            have had this problem in our own country, and perhaps it has not yet
                            been dealt with completely adequately. It is important that the Japanese
                            labor movement not be controlled by communists. They are extremely able
                            organizers, and excel at organizing mass movements. Of course we do not
                            think, and the Japanese Government would not think, that mere repression
                            is the answer. What is needed is a good labor movement which will not
                            fall under the leadership of men with ulterior motives.</p>
                        <p>Education needs careful watching, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            continued. The communist emphasis on youth and the training of youth is
                            one element in their worldwide program, and is a great element of
                            danger. They think about the education of youth in long-range terms. Too
                            often democratic societies, with elections every few years, think in
                            shorter-range terms. The communists are also apt to penetrate into
                            teachers’ unions. The Secretary said that he did not know whether the
                            proposal regarding education in the Ryukyus was practicable, but that he
                            would take note of it and submit it for study to those who have the
                            primary responsibility for the Ryukyus.</p>
                        <p>We too, continued the Secretary, are gratified at the prompt
                            implementation of the agreements reached with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>. By means of the new Joint
                            Committee on Security, it was possible to develop an acceptable degree
                            of mutuality to serve the interests of both countries without modifying
                            the terms of the Security Treaty, <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493"
                                facs="0521"/>which would have been very difficult. Rapid progress
                            has also been made in the withdrawal of ground combat forces, which the
                            Secretary understood would all have left Japan by the end of this
                            year.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the Bonin Islands, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> went on, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had been told that we
                            would study the possibility of repatriation, and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had suggested that, if
                            repatriation seemed impracticable, indemnification of the former
                            inhabitants be considered. The matter has been considered, and
                            considered very carefully, said the Secretary, but he was sorry to say
                            that the result was negative. A real effort had been made to see if it
                            would be practicable. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he had
                            pressed the Defense Department very strongly to justify their stand
                            against any repatriation, and that he had been convinced of the validity
                            of their arguments. He had concluded that their analysis of security
                            factors was valid, and that repatriation was just not practicable.
                            Indeed, he thought that the Defense Department regretted the presence of
                            the 176 or so persons who were already there. While he had said that
                            this conclusion was mainly justified by the Defense Department, who bear
                            primary responsibility for the Bonin Islands, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> emphasized, he did not want it thought
                            that the whole onus of the decision was theirs. He himself doubted
                            whether it would in fact serve the interests of our two countries if one
                            or two hundred persons returned to the islands. That would only increase
                            the demands and produce a recurrent problem. While the reasons for this
                            conclusion had been primarily adduced by the military authorities, he
                            said, he did not feel that the conclusion was necessarily against the
                            cause of good relations between the two countries. Experience shows that
                            a little beginning only increases the demand. There is a real limit to
                            means of livelihood on these islands, and very little land. It would be
                            much better to take Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            suggested alternative and consider indemnification. That alternative he
                            would be glad to consider.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that he would turn to the question of war
                            criminals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said that
                            there was no problem in the cases of the three civilian Class A
                            criminals, but that the other seven Class A’s, who are former military
                            men, were more difficult.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that this was a technical problem to
                            him, and perhaps it was to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> as well. He was somewhat confused by the
                            distinctions between A’s, B’s, C’s, parole, civilians, military, etc.
                            The Foreign Minister said that if there was a disposition on the
                            Secretary’s part to do something about the war criminals, that would
                            suffice, and he would leave a paper<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">Not
                                found in Department of State files.</note> with the Department for
                            the discussion of details.</p>
                        <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0522"/>
                        <p>We do expect to do something about them, the Secretary replied. We are
                            prepared to recommend to the other countries concerned reduction of the
                            sentences of the three civilian Class A men to the time they have
                            already served, so that they can start anew with a clean slate. We will
                            try to do something for the other seven, and to find some way of ending
                            surveillance. Regarding the Class B and C men, however, we have some
                            doubt as to whether the present Japanese Commission meets the
                            requirements which we have for review of the cases by a non-political
                            body.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister asked that the recommendation to the other countries
                            regarding the Class A men be made as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said that we were now
                            trying to work that out. Our parole board is reluctant to treat the
                            former military men on the same basis as the civilians, but if it proves
                            impossible to reduce their sentences we will try to end the
                            surveillance.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then returned to the question of education in the
                            Ryukyu Islands, and said that the Japanese Ministry of Education had
                            made a study of the textbooks in use in the Ryukyus. These texts, it had
                            been found, were not appropriate for the education of the people of the
                            Ryukyus, who are, after all, Japanese from the political point of view.
                            He asked whether it would not be possible to adopt the Japanese point of
                            view in the texts, or to use Japanese texts. He requested that
                            consideration be given to consultation with the Japanese regarding
                            textbooks.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> had a paper on the texts pointing out the parts
                            considered objectionable. The Foreign Minister said that he would send
                            such a paper after his return to Japan. The Secretary asked that it be
                            turned over to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName>, and expressed the thought that something
                            might be done.<note n="3" xml:id="d229fn3">In a memorandum to the

                                reported that the High Commissioner of the Ryukyus was opposed to
                                return of outright or modified control of Ryukyuan education to the
                                Japanese Government, on the ground that it would set a precedent and
                                be an invitation for demands for reversion of other areas of civil
                                government to Japan. Moreover, the High Commissioner pointed out
                                that most textbooks at the primary and secondary levels were already
                                chosen from those approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education.

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> then asked the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> then said that he
                            understood well the difficulty of the military point of view on the
                            Bonin Islands, but that Japanese public opinion was very strong on this
                            subject. If the military would <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0523"
                            />only be specific and say what type of people they did not want in the
                            Bonins (Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> interjected: any) or what number
                            (Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>: any) or in what places (Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>: any) then progress could be made.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister continued that not only the Japanese, but all
                            Oriental peoples, have a strong religious desire to visit the graves of
                            their ancestors, and said that the Japanese would deeply appreciate
                            arrangements being made for such visits to the Bonins.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> had made a strong sentimental and moral appeal for
                            such visits, which had impressed those who heard it. The Secretary had
                            inquired about the feasibility, but had been told that it was not
                            possible to find the graves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said we had been
                            informed that many grave markers had been destroyed by bombing during
                            the war and that the jungle growth in the meantime had also obliterated
                            many of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> said that as far as
                            the Japanese Government is concerned, it cannot tell the people that
                            they cannot return to the Bonins to visit graves because there are no
                            graves. The people themselves would know the locations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> asked whether it would be feasible to
                            send a Japanese Government representative to the islands to verify the
                            situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> pointed
                            out that while there were no facilities for visitors on the islands, we
                            would explore this suggestion.</p>
                        <p>It was impossible to believe that there were no graves, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> continued. Common sense
                            dictated that in a place where thousands of people had lived there would
                            be graves.</p>
                        <p>But the markers have been destroyed, rejoined the Secretary, and the
                            place is heavily overgrown. What could be done to put the Japanese
                            Government in a position to verify the facts? The Foreign Minister said
                            that at any rate he would appreciate it if the Secretary would pursue
                            the matter sympathetically.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> than went on to say
                            the he had been asked by the Prime Minister to mention the matter of the
                            nuclear tests which the United States has announced it intends to carry
                            out next spring. The Japanese people, old and young, are very sensitive
                            on this question. It is not merely a question of communists. The
                            Japanese Government was placed in a position where it had to lodge a
                            protest. The handling of this matter is vital for the conservative
                            government. The psychological situation in Japan compels the Government
                            to stand for disarmament, the abolition of war, and the establishment of
                            peace, and against the manufacture and use of all nuclear weapons. This
                            was the background of the Foreign Minister’s speech the other day at the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly.<note n="4"

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> interjected that he had thought it a very
                            good address.</p>
                        <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0524"/>
                        <p>The Japanese Government faces elections in 1959, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> continued, unless they should
                            occur sooner by reason of dissolution of the Diet. It is the intent of
                            the Government and the Liberal-Democratic Party to win a large number of
                            seats in the Diet. If the question of nuclear testing should be handled
                            awkwardly or unfortunately, the very existence of the Liberal-Democratic
                            Party might be endangered. Japan has therefore concluded that it had to
                            make a unilateral proposal for the banning of nuclear tests.</p>
                        <p>The matter of United States-Japan trade relations was then brought up by
                            the Foreign Minister. The Japanese Government, he said, appreciates the
                            present Administration’s profound understanding of Japan’s need for
                            trade, and knows that all possible efforts, including the use of the
                            veto, have been made to avoid adverse courses of action. The Japanese
                            people know that there will be elections in the United States next year,
                            and that the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act will expire. They fear that
                            these events will be accompanied by increased agitation for trade
                            restrictions. Within Japan every effort is being made to hold down
                            quotas on exports to the United States and to carry out orderly
                            marketing. Controls are exercised on both quality and volume. While the
                            two governments agree as to the logic of these measures, however, the
                            simple logic of the common man in Japan notes only that Japan buys twice
                            as much from the United States as she sells, and that Japan is hard put
                            to find the dollar exchange to make up the difference between a billion
                            dollars in purchases and half a billion dollars in sales. Most of the
                            items in the export trade to the United States are those handled by
                            small and medium business enterprises, and these firms are especially
                            hard hit by restrictions. The Foreign Minister said that he understood
                            the American measures already being taken, but earnestly hoped that
                            every effort would be made to maintain the present arrangements, since
                            any move to restrict trade further would weaken the overall relationship
                            between Japan and the United States.</p>
                        <p>There are many small firms in Japan in the export trade, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> continued. Particularly among
                            these there is a strong desire to increase trade with communist China.
                            The Government and informed circles have no high expectations regarding
                            increased trade with the Chinese communists, but the demands of the
                            trading firms must be satisfied to some extent and directed into
                            non-injurious channels. This problem is completely divorced from the
                            question of political recognition. The Japanese Government is now
                            considering granting permission for the stationing in Japan of a Chinese
                            communist trade representative. The Government’s purpose is to prevent
                            leftists and communists from involving themselves in the trade as
                            middlemen and steering the trade in a manner not beneficial to Japan. It
                            is contemplated that there would be in Japan a representative of the
                            International Import and Export Corporation of China with whom the
                            Japanese <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0525"/>traders could deal
                            directly, instead of having to deal through local leftist middlemen. The
                            Japanese believe that this approach will keep trade in trading channels,
                            and will keep politics out. They feel that this is the most practical
                            way to direct into proper channels the strong demand in Japan for trade
                            relations with communist China, but emphasize that it is not a step
                            towards political recognition.</p>
                        <p>As the Secretary would recall, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> went on, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> had proposed a Southeast Asia development fund. We
                            all understand that there are many approaches to develop this idea in a
                            practicable and feasible form. The Japanese do not necessarily intend to
                            insist upon the <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> proposals in
                            their original form, but are awaiting the reactions, comments,
                            criticisms and suggestions of the Southeast Asian countries. The Foreign
                            Minister would welcome any comments from the Secretary, whether
                            favorable or unfavorable, and any suggestions he might care to make. It
                            was not necessary to do the whole thing at once, but the Japanese rather
                            want to start with what is feasible now. With that in mind, the Japanese
                            budget for next year will contain funds for financing a technical
                            training center for cooperation with the Southeast Asian nations. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> asked for suggestions
                            in that connection, and for further earnest consideration by the United
                            States. The Japanese purpose, he explained, was not only to assist in
                            the economic development of the other countries concerned, but also to
                            expand trade for the benefit of Japan and the entire free world. He
                            asked for the Secretary’s comments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he would take up the
                            disarmament question first. Both he and the Foreign Minister had spoken
                            on that subject at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General
                            Assembly in New York; he had examined in a tentative way what the
                            Foreign Minister had said, and he hoped that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> had done the same about his
                            remarks. The Secretary said that he understood quite well the natural
                            abhorrence which the people of Japan feel for atomic weapons, although
                            he expected more people had actually died under worse conditions in
                            Tokyo than in Hiroshima. The basic fact was this: there has been
                            discovered in the last twelve years a great new source of power. Within
                            time, in perhaps 5, 10, or 20 years, no one can say just when, this
                            source of power will be used in almost everything we do. If we consider
                            the situation 50 years from now, perhaps all our lights, our clocks,
                            even our watches, will run by this power. Now it is in a crude state. It
                            is like electricity, which once was nothing but lightning to burn down
                            houses, but now is a great servant of men both for war and in peace,
                            happily more for peace than for war.</p>
                        <p>To think that this new power would not be used if we have a war would be
                            unrealistic, the Secretary continued. Even if they destroyed all nuclear
                            weapons now, the great powers could remake them in a matter of a few
                            weeks. It took a long time to make the first ones, but <pb n="498"
                                xml:id="pg_498" facs="0526"/>now it would be easy and would almost
                            surely be done. If we can take steps to make war less likely, such as
                            mutual inspection, and if there is no war, then of course nuclear
                            weapons will not be used. But if we cannot make war less likely, then we
                            must study ways to use the atom with the least destruction of life. This
                            assumes that we conduct our testing under conditions not injurious to
                            human life. As the Secretary had stated at the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, we are prepared to stop testing nuclear weapons if
                            steps are taken at the same time to make war less likely, but if the
                            latter is not done, then we must find weapons which, if used, will not
                            destroy all human life.</p>
                        <p>We realize, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> went on, that the Japanese
                            Government has a special problem that is more emotional than reasonable.
                            The American people perhaps reason about this, while the Japanese view
                            the problem emotionally, and the Japanese Government must take that into
                            account. If we thought the testing was injurious we would be the first
                            to stop it, as we are in the most danger. There is more testing in the
                            United States then elsewhere, and the prevailing winds blow the residue
                            of explosions in our direction, but we are taking and will continue to
                            take proper safeguards. We think it is possible to keep future
                            discharges of radioactive material into the atmosphere within an amount
                            which will do no more than replace that material which is losing its
                            radioactivity, thus not exceeding the present level of radioactivity.
                            The Secretary hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> would have an opportunity to talk to Admiral
                            Strauss about these technical aspects.</p>
                        <p>We hope, continued the Secretary, that we can work closely together at
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on these matters. We realize that
                            the Japanese have special problems and will not press them unduly
                            regarding politically important things. We want to strengthen the
                            Foreign Minister and the Government, not lead them to political suicide.
                            The Secretary hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> and the Japanese Government recognize the
                            integrity of our purpose, as we do theirs, and that we can work closely
                            and avoid any appearance of the Japanese joining with the Russians. The
                            position of the Russians is not sound and would greatly injure the
                            defense capability of the free world.</p>
                        <p>With respect to trade, the Secretary went on, we are confident that the
                            Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act will be renewed next year. There is some
                            increase in protectionist feeling in the South. The South has changed.
                            It used to be an agricultural area, producing cotton for export. Now it
                            is to a considerable extent industrialized and the market for cotton is
                            not abroad, but here in Washington in the Commodity Credit Corporation.
                            They know that they have a support price, and what cannot be sold abroad
                            will be bought here. There is no dependence on foreign markets. It is
                            for these two reasons that the South has become more protectionist. You
                            may say that it is wrong, but it is a fact. I say that it is wrong too,
                            said Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, but I know it to be a <pb n="499"
                                xml:id="pg_499" facs="0527"/>fact. We are confident, however, that
                            the Trade Agreements Act will be renewed and the President is already
                            thinking and talking of plans to assure that it is.</p>
                        <p>Regarding trade with communist China, the Secretary went on, the Japanese
                            would suffer bad political consequences if they were to open a regular
                            trade office on the China mainland. The small businessmen would not
                            benefit, because the communists do not deal with small traders. They
                            like items such as electronic equipment. The political liability would
                            be greater than the commercial benefits. He realized that the Japanese
                            consider their plan the lesser of two evils. Perhaps they were right; he
                            did not know. He thought, however, that it would be useful for them to
                            consider the example of Chancellor Adenauer who was quite successful
                            politically without indulging in compromise.</p>
                        <p>We feel, the Secretary continued, that the growth of trade between Japan
                            and the Southeast Asian countries is very important, and in principle we
                            favor and encourage the idea of economic development such as suggested
                            by the Japanese. We do not think, however, that the proposed
                            organization with a capital of $700 million is practical. Multiplicity
                            of means is not desirable; we already have the World Bank, the
                            Export-Import Bank, our new development loan fund, and we prefer to work
                            through these generalized institutions rather than set up a new one of
                            limited character. It is frequently the case that others desire to set
                            up new banks with United States funds. The North Atlantic Treaty
                            Organization wants one for the African trade. The <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> wants SUNFED and things of that sort. When Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> was recently in Buenos Aires,
                            they wanted something for South America, and so on. If there is a real
                            opportunity to do business between Japan and Southeast Asia and help is
                            needed from the United States, we will find one means or another to
                            help. The important thing, however, is to find the business and then see
                            if a new organization is needed. Where there is a good business prospect
                            it should be possible to find means of providing the capital. The
                            Japanese are proceeding on a more modest basis, and that is fine. If the
                            idea develops, we may find some way to help. First, though, it is
                            necessary to get the responses from the other countries, which will shed
                            light on the problem.</p>
                        <p>To recapitulate, said the Secretary, the idea of Japan-Southeast Asia
                            cooperation is absolutely sound. The Japanese have the technical
                            know-how and the industrial capacity. The other countries have raw
                            materials. The United States, however, does not feel that new regional
                            institutions are necessary, but rather that the present institutions are
                            adequate. We will welcome further knowledge of the situation when it is
                            obtained by the Japanese. If there is business to be done but no credit
                            available, then will be the time to think of a new institution. We fully
                            recognize that trade is vital for Japan. With a population soon
                            approaching 100 million, Japan needs a solid, dependable foreign <pb
                                n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0528"/>trade, not the kind to be found
                            on the China mainland, which has never really been a major market for
                            Japan. It is important to encourage the development of new markets, but
                            the need for a new agency has not been demonstrated.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d229fn5">This portion of the conversation is summarized in

                        <p>The Secretary then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> if he had anything to add. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he did not, but that
                            he was always glad to hear from the Japanese. He would be particularly
                            interested in learning the responses from the Southeast Asian nations to
                            the Japanese approach, since in the past they had not been noted for any
                            desire for regional organization.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> said that
                            he had no responses as yet, and so did not intend to pursue the matter
                            in detail. The Japanese plan to move ahead in a modest way, however, and
                            any evidence of support would help them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that if the responses indicate that
                            business can be done and more capital is needed, the Japanese should not
                            hesitate to come to us on a case by case basis. Under Mr. Stassen’s
                            guidance the “Arc of Asia” plan had been proposed, but it had not been
                            possible to find reality behind the name. The Southeast Asian countries
                            were not anxious for triangular or multilateral business, and our
                            experience had not been good. Perhaps the Japanese will develop
                            possibilities which we could not find, however. The Secretary said that
                            he did not guarantee the funds to make up shortages of capital, but the
                            Japanese should talk to us and we will try to help.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> stated that the
                            Japanese already had two or three concrete programs in mind. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that this was fine.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister noted that time was running short, and that he would
                            just like to mention several other topics, such as the sale of surplus
                            agricultural commodities to Japan, an agreement for the peaceful use of
                            atomic energy and temporary agricultural workers.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that a program had been worked out to increase the
                            number of temporary agricultural workers from Japan by 1,000 per year
                            for the next two years, so that there would be a total of 3,000 in this
                            country thereafter on a revolving basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that this
                            matter was not yet ready for public announcement and that no premature
                            public disclosure should be made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> said that other topics
                            which he would like to mention in passing were the return of vested
                            Japanese assets in the United States, and the desire of Japan Air Lines
                            for terminal rights at Los Angeles. He also wanted to call attention to
                            the deadlocked negotiations between Japan and the Republic of Korea. He
                            would not cover <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0529"/>the whole
                            course of the negotiations, he said, but the problems boil down to the
                            fact that the Republic of Korea will not accept the United States
                            interpretation of the Japanese Peace Treaty on property claims,</p>
                        <p>As a final point, said Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA1"
                                >Fujiyama</persName>, he wanted to urge the importance of cultural
                            relations. The Russians were very vigorous and aggressive in sending
                            artists to Japan. These artists, such as the Bolshoi Ballet, which is at
                            present in Japan, are welcomed not merely by the communists in Japan but
                            by all people who admire their artistry. Because of the lack of dollar
                            funds, Japan cannot invite American artists to come to Japan. The
                            Russians, however, pay all the expenses for their groups. Serious
                            efforts should be made regarding this problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he attached great importance to this problem. On
                            an early trip to Japan he took with him Mr. John D. Rockefeller 3rd<note
                                n="6" xml:id="d229fn6">Reference is to <persName>Dulles</persName>’
                                stay in Japan, January 25–February 11, 1951. For documentation, see
                                    <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1951, vol. VI, pp. 132
                                ff. and 777 ff.</note> and got him interested in certain types of
                            cultural exchange. The <persName corresp="#p_RNA1"
                                >Rockefeller</persName> Foundation, of which Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> had been chairman, financed the
                            exchanges of persons to some extent. He mentioned this only to show the
                            importance which he himself attached to this type of relationship. A
                            society operating along private lines, however, cannot do some of the
                            things that a totalitarian regime can do. We cannot order artists to go
                            somewhere, or easily pay their way. On the other hand the point
                            certainly deserves mention and should be in our minds.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> then said
                            that although this had been a very interesting discussion he was deeply
                            disappointed in regard to the Bonin Islands. It seemed that there was no
                            hope, He would be very grateful at this time if he could hear an
                            assurance that the problem could still be discussed and that study would
                            continue. He was particularly disappointed because as a result of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> visit there had arisen a
                            hope that some solution would be arrived at to give some satisfaction to
                            the Japanese people and especially to the Bonin Islanders. It would be
                            most disappointing and heartbreaking if he were to convey the
                            Secretary’s words to the Japanese. Could the Department of State
                            continue to discuss this question with the Department of Defense and
                            find some formula to satisfy Japan? The area of admittance might be
                            restricted, the number of persons, or the occupations they were to
                            follow, any formula to give the Bonin Islanders some satisfaction. He
                            hoped that the door was not completely closed. From the point of view of
                            our overall relations a solution should be found. These people were not
                            communists. They are hard-working men of integrity. It would be
                            heartbreaking for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> to
                            bring them disappointment. If the door were open even to one or two
                            hundred he <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0530"/>was sure that the
                            Boin Islanders’ League could take the responsibility of selecting only
                            those who would represent the best in the Bonin Islands.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> was here the latter had stated that if
                            repatriation was too difficult then indemnification might be a solution.
                            The Secretary then read the following remarks of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> from the record of their talks:
                                (<gloss target="#t_KIV1">KIV</gloss> 7a) <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“If …<note n="7" xml:id="d229fn7">Ellipsis in the source

                                    extremely difficult to permit even these persons to return, then
                                    he had to point out that the question arose of indemnification
                                    for those persons who were unable to return and who were having
                                    difficulty in maintaining their livelihood in Japan
                                        proper.”<note n="8" xml:id="d229fn8"><ref target="#d188"
                                            >Document 188</ref>.</note></p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered whether this was not the solution for them to
                            consider. There were security factors on which he could not elaborate,
                            he said, but which were particularly important now with the withdrawal
                            of American forces from Japan. These factors require an exclusive
                            military reserve. If these factors had been known in the period
                            immediately after the end of the war, it was probable the 176 present
                            inhabitants would not have been readmitted to the islands. The military
                            authorities had explained this in a convincing way, and he had not been
                            easy to convince. He would have preferred to meet the wishes of the
                            Japanese Government but he had been persuaded otherwise. There is very
                            little land in the Bonin Islands, and they are required as an exclusive
                            military reserve. No one is wanted there. We would be glad to send the
                            176 back to the main islands of Japan if the Japanese Government wants
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that to discuss the matter of
                            indemnification would put an end to discussion of the whole matter of
                            repatriation, and this would be extremely embarrassing to him. It was
                            injustice and discrimination against other upright people that the
                            present 176 inhabitants of partly Caucasian descent were the only
                            Japanese allowed to live in the islands. He wondered whether further
                            consideration could not be given to the admittance of a restricted
                            number to a restricted area, under any other appropriate restrictions.
                            He was not lacking in cognizance of the security of the United States,
                            but the fact that some islanders of part Caucasian blood had been
                            allowed to return was embarrassing.</p>
                        <p>It was not because we wanted to discriminate in favor of them, the
                            Secretary said, that we had allowed these people to return, but because
                            they were being discriminated against in Japan. The discrimination did
                            not start with us, but with the Japanese. If we had it to do over, we
                            would not take them. They have only a meager existence and <pb n="503"
                                xml:id="pg_503" facs="0531"/>are an embarrassment to the security of
                            the islands. There is no need to make a public announcement, he
                            continued, but it would be better to try paving the way for
                            indemnification and for resettlement of these people in Japan. We have
                            exhausted the means for consideration of this problem. The Defense
                            Department has reasons which the Japanese would recognize as valid if
                            they knew of them. We should not let a hundred people out of 90 million
                            become a major difference between our countries; we are dealing with
                            bigger elements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> questioned whether
                            Japan had in fact originally discriminated against the part Caucasian
                            Bonin Islanders.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary rejoined that neither he nor Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> had firsthand information on that point.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he fervently hoped that the Secretary
                            would not stop considering this problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he would “not stop considering,
                            but … ”<note n="9" xml:id="d229fn9">Ellipsis in the source
                            text.</note></p>
                        <p>However much he had been convinced by the military, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> continued, he hoped that the
                            Secretary would continue to discuss with them all aspects of the problem
                            and find something that would contribute to our mutual relations.</p>
                        <p>We reach the point, the Secretary said, where it is not fair or right to
                            keep alive hopes. In fairness to them the islanders should be told to
                            settle down where they are. At best the Japanese request would affect
                            only one or two hundred people out of several thousand. Whether it is
                            better to keep alive these hopes is very doubtful. We have tried to find
                            a way to squeeze a few people into these wretched islands, but it is
                            impossible. It would be better for the Foreign Minister to report to
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and see if he
                            does not agree to discuss indemnification. We will await further word,
                            the Secretary concluded.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> said that that was
                            agreeable to him. The Secretary then handed Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> a memorandum containing an
                            agreed announcement to be made to the press. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> approved the announcement, but
                            said that the Japanese would also like to be able to inform their press
                            that Southeast Asian development and United States-Japanese cultural
                            relations had been discussed. This was agreed to. (Press announcement

                        <p>The Foreign Minister then said that he would like to give the press, as
                            background information, a statement that he had opened formal
                            negotiations with the Secretary on an agreement for the peaceful uses of
                            atomic energy. After a brief discussion with the other officers present,
                            the Secretary said that he had no objection to this.</p>

                        <p>After an exchange of cordialities, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Robertson</persName> reminded the Ambassador that he had told him
                            the previous evening that he wished to say something more about the
                            Bonin Island situation. It was a matter that concerned us very much but
                            one into which the Secretary had not gone during his conversation with
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> on
                            Monday. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> went on to
                            say that, as the Ambassador knew, we were pulling back our forces from
                            his country. The general situation was such that we could not abandon
                            our strategic position until threat and tension eased. The essential
                            factor in forcing us to maintain our strategic position was the fact
                            that the Communists continued to have the same basic aggressive policies
                            which they have pursued, as witness the fate of sixteen nations. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> gave examples of how
                            the Communists in Asia continue to have an aggressive posture. He said
                            that although they talk of peace they continue to build up their
                            military forces. He mentioned ten Communist airfields between Canton and
                            Shanghai which are equipped to handle jet planes. He spoke of the
                            Communist successes in Indochina and their continuous military build-up.
                            The Vietminh, he said, had 350,000 to 400,000 troops while Vietnam has
                            only 140,000. Against this aggressive posture of the Communists the only
                            real, forceful deterrent in Asia was the United States. What other
                            country, he asked, would oppose overt aggression? Full responsibility
                            fell upon the United States and whatever Asian allies it had. In the
                            Korean war, for example, the maximum number of United Nations troops
                            other than American was 35,000. The war was expensive in American lives,
                            and it cost <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0533"/>us $18 billion as
                            well. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said that he
                            knew the Ambassador was aware of all this but he reminded him of it only
                            so that he would realize the United States must keep its strategic
                            posture in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>The position of the Bonins had changed, said Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName>. The United States had
                            strategic uses for those islands which made them a defense for Japan as
                            well as for the United States, and the Defense Department now had plans
                            for the use of all of Chichi Jima and Haha Jima, necessitating complete
                            exclusion. If the decision were being made now the Navy would not even
                            bring back the first inhabitants. That they did so immediately after the
                            war was only to protect them from discrimination in Japan. Their
                            repatriation did not discriminate against others. Moreover, they were
                            not difficult to deal with. They did not object to the presence of a
                            United States military base near their homes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said that no one this
                            side of the President would be able to get the Defense Department to
                            allow even a few hundred Japanese into these islands. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> himself had spent hours
                            talking to the responsible officials in Defense. The Secretary of State
                            himself had had several meetings on the subject. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> was sure that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> understood. He
                            certainly would if he were an American. We were sorry, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> stated, to have to say “no” to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> who was visiting the
                            United States for the first time as Foreign Minister. Both Defense and
                            State appreciated the importance of Japan and desired earnestly to solve
                            the problems confronting the two nations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said he understood
                            the economic problem of Japan. Raw cotton sold by the United States to
                            Japan was double the value of cotton textiles which the United States
                            bought from Japan in return. Japan had had an adverse balance with the
                            United States of $900 million over the last three years. Japan was one
                            of America’s best customers, the best next to Canada and the United
                            Kingdom. In agriculture it was the very best. He said that he was
                            accustomed to telling these facts to Congressmen and other influential
                            Americans at every opportunity. The Government was confronted with the
                            necessity of convincing the general public that it was in the American
                            interest to buy more from Japan. Proposed state textile legislation of
                            discriminatory character was defeated in Georgia, Louisiana and
                            Connecticut. Although the existing laws in South Carolina and Alabama
                            were not being enforced, the United States Government would continue its
                            efforts for their repeal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> said what he wished
                            the Ambassador would tell the Foreign Minister was that the Bonin
                            problem was the toughest problem he could possibly have posed at this
                            juncture.</p>
                        <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0534"/>
                        <p>The Defense Department, explained Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Robertson</persName>, was opposed to pilgrimages of the exiled
                            islanders to their ancestral graves in the Bonins. There were no
                            facilities to take care of such pilgrimages and the Defense Department
                            was against such visits for security reasons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> interrupted to say that
                            the statement there were no tombs was ridiculous. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> agreed, and said that if he
                            had been born and raised in the Bonins he would be able to find his own
                            home and the graves of his ancestors even though he had not been there
                            for over ten years. This was only an excuse; the real reason was the
                            desire for complete exclusion. If pilgrims came it would cause
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> stated that when
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> came the
                            Japanese had received wonderful news—a ray of hope when the Secretary
                            had agreed that possibly 200 or 300 Bonin Islanders might be

                            quite contrary to creating an expectation that repatriation was possible
                            and likely, the Secretary had said that it would be extremely difficult,
                            that the President might not even agree in principle, and that it would
                            raise more problems than it would solve, but that despite this fact the
                            United States was prepared to study the matter further. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had asked how many islanders the
                            United States might consider repatriating and the Secretary had said
                            that the maximum would be 200 to 300, but that military security would
                            be the determining factor. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Robertson</persName> pointed out that in preparing the Joint
                            Communiqué at the White House on June 21 the Secretary had purposely
                            deleted the sentence dealing with the possibility that there might be
                            limited repatriation.<note n="3" xml:id="d230fn3">The conversation in

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> said the point was that
                            when the Japanese got the statement from the Secretary they thought
                            there was a ray of hope. Was this not a reasonable thing to do? Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> replied that the
                            Secretary had been very careful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Asakai</persName> reasserted that the United States had given the
                            Japanese hope. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName>
                            agreed, and said that it was true that there had been the hope that
                            Defense might be persuaded to let in 200, but this hope had not been
                            realized. The Ambassador said that the Japanese hopes had been dashed
                            yesterday. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> replied
                            that he had done his best but had not succeeded, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK1">Asakai</persName> went on to say that the Bonin
                            Islanders were very decent and cooperative people to which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> agreed, saying he had met some
                            of them two years ago right in this room.</p>
                        <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0535"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador described the repatriation issue as a “hot ball”. The
                            United States Government had carried it for two months after the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> visit but now the
                            Japanese Government would have to carry it for awhile. The issue was, he
                            said, blown up all out of proportion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Robertson</persName> commented that it was similar to the Girard
                            case. He had been out talking to some ex-soldiers and had told them
                            plain facts about the Girard case which they had never read in the
                            newspapers. The Ambassador thought it was a matter of emotions—like the
                            nuclear test explosions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said on a recent evening he had met a highly
                            literate group and had held with them a round table discussion on mutual
                            security. These people despite their excellent education and presumable
                            ability to get at the facts had held highly distorted opinions and were
                            in fact misinformed. If such people were misinformed, it was no wonder
                            that the ordinary man on the street was swayed by emotion.</p>

                            urging the governments represented on the International Military
                            Tribunal for the Far East to reduce sentence to time served in the cases
                            of the Class A parolees. Without White House intervention, the Clemency
                            and Parole Board is prepared only to take this action in regard to the
                            three civilian cases, plus termination of parole supervision in the
                            remaining seven military Class A cases.<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2"

                        <p>To resolve this impasse and enable the United States to move ahead on
                            this problem, <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> has gained the informal

                            Secretary of the Clemency and Parole Board to the following course of
                            action: To convene a meeting of officers of the Washington embassies of
                            the seven other governments represented on the Tribunal and outline the
                            Japanese request and the action which the <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510"
                                facs="0538"/>United States is prepared to take. The United States
                            representative would indicate the reluctance of our own Board to reduce
                            sentence to time served in the seven military cases but state that the
                            United States would concur in a majority decision of the governments
                            concerned to do so.</p>
                        <p>In view of past actions of the other governments, it is quite likely that
                            a majority would favor reduction of sentence to time served in all the
                            cases.</p>
                        <p>Implementation of the foregoing proposal is contingent upon obtaining the
                            approval of the Clemency and Parole Board to the United States
                            representative informing the other governments that the United States
                            would concur in a majority decision to reduce sentences to time served
                            in the seven military cases. The Executive Secretary of the Board is of
                            the opinion that the Board members would approve such action.</p>
                        <p>The next Board meeting will be held about October 11. Mr. Lyons has been
                            appointed as the Defense representative on the Board.</p>

                            helpful. We are pleased to note that no United States proposal was made
                            for a change in the Military Assistance Program for Japan since, upon
                            our joint authorization, <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0539"

                            the Japanese Government in August that this was the case. Moreover, I am
                            informed that Finance Minister Ichimada, during his call on Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, was assured that our
                            policy with regard to military assistance for Japan was unchanged.<note

                        <p>I recognize that the reduction in the Mutual Security aid level voted by

                            programs for all countries, including Japan. The Japanese Government, I
                            am sure, is also aware of this fact. However, as you know, Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> is the first
                            Japanese Prime Minister since the Peace Treaty to show evidence of a
                            real willingness to tackle the problem of building an adequate defense
                            force in Japan. In June of this year he directed and obtained Cabinet
                            approval for both a basic defense policy and an official defense plan
                            covering the Japanese fiscal years 1958, 1959 and 1960. However, he
                            still faces formidable opposition in this endeavor. Therefore, I know
                            you share our concern that in considering our military assistance
                            programs for Japan, we make certain that as far as possible such
                            programs support the present effort of the Japanese Government to build
                            an effective defense force.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing, we are most anxious that there be the
                            closest possible liaison between our two departments and with our
                            Embassy and military representatives in Tokyo. Through this means,
                            military aid proposals will be carefully weighed in the light of their
                            impact upon the Japanese defense build-up.</p>

                            is a well-written report and includes a lot of meat, but it strikes us
                            that the general tenor is somewhat over-optimistic. On the whole the
                            report seems to give the impression that <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s position is very strong and that the prospects
                            for a fairly long <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> tenure are
                            correspondingly good.</p>
                        <p>Our feeling is that <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> is only
                            now approaching his real testing period and there are several elements
                            of danger in his position. He is facing several difficult problems,
                            including the labor question which is extremely delicate, an economic
                            situation which is still uncertain, and a precarious balance of factions
                            within the <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> itself. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s personality has not taken hold
                            on the great mass of the people despite his efforts to build a
                                “<persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> boom.” Judging from the
                            present situation it is not at all certain that the conservatives will
                            be able to increase substantially their total of Lower House seats in
                            the next general elections. It may even be that they will lose a
                            few.</p>
                        <p>While the conservative position has been somewhat overdrawn in the OIR
                            report, it also seems to us that the vote-getting ability of the
                            Socialists has been underestimated. We feel it is rather dangerous to
                            assume Socialist internal difficulties automatically mean a dilution of
                            their strength in outlying areas where national issues are often of
                            little concern and Socialist unity is relatively greater.</p>
                        <p>Thus in general we fell that there is no reason for complacency in the
                            situation here and that <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> will
                            need whatever assistance he can get from us to maintain his
                            position.</p>
                        <p>I enclose a copy of this letter for our friends in DRF. We aren’t trying
                            to start a controversy, but thought both <gloss target="#t_NA1"

                                            participation in their administration. Japan wittingly

                                            of national identity. They see no possibility of
                                            attaining one except through reversion to Japan as they
                                            have no affinity to the United States and little chance
                                            of survival as an independent nation. Since the Islands
                                            eventually are to revert to Japan, our policies and
                                            actions in the Ryukyus over the next few years should be

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Jack</hi>: I am sorry that this reply to your
                            letter of August 2, 1957<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2">Not found.</note>
                            concerning United States policies regarding the Ryukyu Islands has been
                            so long delayed. Representatives of our two Departments have had many
                            discussions, however, of this and related matters during the past few
                            months as a result of the visits to Washington of Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> and other Japanese
                            officials. Nevertheless, it seems desirable to reaffirm our position
                            regarding policies which we believe will make possible our continued
                            occupancy of the Islands for as long as “conditions of threat and
                            tension persist in the Far East.”</p>
                        <p>Your letter of August 2, 1957, alleges a basic difference of view between
                            the Department of State and the Department of Defense on the
                            implementation of United States policy in the Ryukyus. Whatever
                            difference we have involves tactics, not objectives. The State
                            Department is in full accord with the Defense Department as to the
                            necessity for strategic reasons for the United States to remain for a
                            long time in <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0543"/>the Ryukyu
                            Islands; also that the United States stake is such as not to brook our
                            sharing administrative responsibilities with Japan. The State Department
                            likewise shares the conviction of the Defense Department that our
                            attitude on this subject should be firm and should be made clear to the
                            Japanese. The major point in your letter upon which we disagree is how
                            to handle the problem of reversionism.</p>
                        <p>The Defense position, as I understand it from your letter, is that only
                            by taking every possible opportunity for actions and statements to
                            remind the Japanese of the exclusive United States administration and
                            control of the islands will the United States be able effectively to
                            reduce reversionist activity in the Ryukyus and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State believes that unnecessary “stirring” of Japanese
                            sentiments of this question will increase rather than decrease Japanese
                            agitation and lead to enhanced reversionist sentiment on the part of the
                            Ryukyuans.</p>
                        <p>This Department views reversionism in the Ryukyus essentially as an
                            expression of the desire of the Ryukyuan people to belong to a country.
                            It is a basic sentiment that cannot be suppressed. The United States has
                            affirmed to Japan the United States policy that the Ryukyu Islands
                            should eventually be returned to Japan. If this position were to be
                            changed and if the Japanese were to be told that the islands would be
                            alienated from them for the foreseeable future, the effects on United
                            States relations with Japan would be most unfortunate. Acts performed to
                            demonstrate the long-range character of the American presence in the
                            islands can be expected to create anti-Americanism, unrest, and a sharp
                            increase in Japanese agitation and in reversionist activity in the
                            Ryukyus. This would provide additional ammunition for the growing
                            leftist anti-American opposition in the islands.</p>
                        <p>The development of Japan as a major power in the Far East associated with
                            the Free World is a fundamental United States policy. Since its entry
                            into the United Nations in December 1956, it has also assumed an
                            important position in world affairs. It has a legitimate interest in the
                            Ryukyus whose people are Japanese nationals and over whose territory
                            Japan possesses residual sovereignty. Under these circumstances, Japan
                            could probably muster a substantial body of international support if it
                            chose to protest United States policies and actions in the Ryukyus.
                            Therefore, even under the present degree of control, the United States
                            needs Japanese understanding of the United States position to permit
                            effective carrying out of our program in the Ryukyus. A calculated
                            policy of “snubbing” Japan with respect to the Ryukyus could not only
                            seriously impede currently successful efforts to establish close working
                            relationships with Japan but as a consequence might also hurt our
                            military position in the Ryukyus as well as in Japan itself.</p>
                        <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0544"/>
                        <p>With regard to the proposed introduction of United States currency into
                            the Ryukyu Islands, this Department disagrees that it would have an
                            inhibiting effect on reversionist activities. On the contrary, it could
                            produce strong reaction in the Ryukyus and Japan similar to that caused
                            by the announcement in June 1956 of the new long-term land acquisition
                            program. Such agitation and unrest at this time would add greatly to the
                            growing wave of anti-Americanism and dissatisfaction from which Mayor
                            Senaga of Naha draws his support and which he will certainly try to
                            unify into an opposition movement affecting all of the Ryukyus. The

                            South Asia. I believe these elections as important to our position in
                            this part of world as recent German elections were to our position in
                            Europe. Outcome will most certainly affect long-term political
                            orientation of Japan. Though timing elections remains uncertain there is
                            possibility they will occur early next year. Hence it important review

                                While decision not yet made and will depend largely on evolution of

                                    >ROK</gloss> on necessity for it to be more forthcoming in

                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> actions are burning issue in
                                certain parts of Japan, notably Kyushu which I recently visited.
                                Japanese liken <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> actions in
                                seizing and imprisoning Japanese fishermen and also in not releasing
                                those who have served their sentences to action of Chinese
                                Communists re US prisoners. They point out <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> holding fishermen as political hostages in
                                violation of basic principles of humanity. A <gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                                possible, release of at least those Japanese fishermen who have
                                served out their sentences (with suitable reciprocity by Japanese on
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> detainees) would certainly

                            <item>Trade, particularly with US, is matter of life or death to Japan’s
                                economy. I understand we will face very serious efforts early next
                                year by certain interests in US to impose quotas or restrictions on
                                Japanese trade. I do not believe we can wait until Congress
                                reconvenes to counteract such efforts. I recommend that US Govt
                                beginning now undertake a systematic campaign to enlighten American
                                public as to vital importance, in terms our own enlightened
                                self-interest, of US-Japan trade. Such campaign should include
                                efforts by govt to enlist support US business interests in Japan. I
                                have recently talked about this with number of prominent American
                                businessmen visiting Japan who have interests here. Many seem
                                sympathetic and well disposed. If US Govt officials could in public
                                speeches and statements stress importance to US of Japan trade and
                                at same time encourage American businessmen with interest here to do
                                same, much good might be accomplished.<note n="3" xml:id="d240fn3"

                                <p>“Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and
                                    Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName>
                                    have asked the Ambassador personally to request that you receive
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> while he is here.
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> is very energetic
                                    and ambitious. It is alleged that he feels that because of his
                                    role in the negotiation of the Japanese-Soviet agreement
                                    restoring diplomatic relations he is regarded by our Government
                                    as being soft on Communism and someone who is willing to work
                                    both the Soviet and Western sides of the street. While
                                    supporting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> at
                                    the present, he unquestionably has ambitions some day to be
                                    Prime Minister. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>
                                    wishes to assure you of his staunch pro-Western and anti-Soviet
                                    orientation, and the Prime Minister believes it would be
                                    particularly valuable for him so to commit himself in talking
                                    with you.</p>

                                        >Robertson</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_KI1"

                                    at Japanese request, again discussed a P.L. 480 program for

                                    in 1957, but the Embassy in Tokyo gave a final negative answer

                            best use of time, they might avoid <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525"
                                facs="0553"/>repetition. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> desired to discuss the political situation in
                            Japan. He said the policies of the <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> Government were unchanged except for the necessity
                            to follow an austerity program temporarily. Responding to the
                            Secretary’s query about the next elections, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that it was his understanding
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> that they would be
                            held in August or September of next year. Prior thereto, the Cabinet
                            would tighten the budget and, with the resulting surplus of 50–70
                            billion yen, government popularity would be regained. A two-thirds
                            majority in the lower house seemed assured. The Secretary asked if this
                            was being sought in order to amend the constitution. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that it would put things on a
                            firm basis. The Cabinet also intended to change the election law for the
                            upper house (eliminating the national constituency) to insure over
                            two-thirds majority in elections next June. The political situation
                            should be settled in a year and a half but formulating party plans would
                            require an additional six months or so. This was the consensus at the
                            latest Liberal-Democratic Party meeting. Consequently, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> believed that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> should remain in control for at
                            least that long.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that, as far as
                            domestic politics were concerned, everything was pretty well under
                            control. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had
                            been too hasty on the international front and had said too much, for
                            instance, on Okinawa and the Bonins as a result of being pushed by the
                            Socialists.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if he meant that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> had held out hopes which could not be realized.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> did not answer directly
                            but said it was absolutely necessary to achieve concrete progress in the
                            solution of problems in Japanese-United States relations. The Secretary
                            replied that we had done quite a few things when Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> was here. He mentioned the
                            Japanese-American Committee on Security as lending a bilateral
                            atmosphere to security arrangements. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> said that the Committee had met twice but that it
                            has not made any progress toward getting anything definite accomplished.
                            Moreover, the withdrawal of United States forces was not a “plus” for
                            Japan because it was not favorable to the foreign exchange position.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that we
                            would see what specific things could be done. However, the best relation
                            between countries was one which did not rest on periodically making
                            presents to each other. A bride and groom exchanged gifts before
                            marriage but did not make a practice of it thereafter, though they lived
                            happily together. The United States could not constantly search for
                            something to give. It did not do so in the case of its best friends.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> insisted that concrete
                            progress must be made on at least one or more of the deadlocked issues
                            of which there were four main ones: <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                            >ROK</gloss>-Japanese negotiations, Okinawa, the Bonins and Southeast
                            Asia economic development. Regarding the first, public sentiment in <pb
                                n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0554"/>Japan believed that the United
                            States could at any time step in and solve <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>-Japanese differences. Regarding the other three, the
                            government of Japan understood the United States viewpoint but this did
                            nothing to advance the <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            Government. If it were not for these pending problems, Japan could
                            follow the Secretary’s doctrine.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United Sates had exerted upon <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Syngman Rhee</persName> all the pressure that was
                            possible between self-respecting governments, in order to resolve
                            Korean-Japanese disputes. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> was immovable, a fact which his broken hands made
                            understandable.</p>
                        <p>The Bonin Islands question was not deadlocked but finished, said the
                            Secretary. He had studied every square mile on maps of the islands,
                            searching for possible areas for repatriation. United States security
                            requirements are such that we cannot bring anyone back. We would be
                            better off now if those that were allowed to return had not been
                            repatriated.</p>
                        <p>On the Southeast Asia development fund, the Secretary remarked that no
                            country had the resources to put up $500 million as capital and then
                            look for ways to put it to work. We had been looking for years to find
                            good projects that might be capitalized jointly. Any worthy project
                            would have our consideration. It was unreasonable, however, to create a
                            new banking institution for every project which might come to mind. To
                            create a regional fund in Southeast Asia would increase demands for the
                            creation of similar regional funds elsewhere. One could not afford to
                            segregate large batches of money. While we could not therefore
                            participate in such a fund, we would welcome the opportunity to study
                            any concrete projects in which Japanese backing needed supplementing by
                            American capital.</p>
                        <p>On the Ryukyus, the Secretary recalled that when he started negotiating
                            the Peace Treaty it was agreed that the Ryukyus should be detached from
                            Japan. As he recollected, they had settled upon the 29th parallel
                            instead of the 30th and the Japanese had regarded this as very generous.
                            Later they had clamored to regain the Amami Islands. The United States
                            had returned them. There was great rejoicing for a few days. Now the
                            Japanese wanted more. The United States could not operate on these
                            principles but must think in terms of the fundamentals of world security
                            and the balance of world power. The basic thing was that Okinawa was
                            strategically essential in the Far East, offering protection to
                            Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines in addition to Japan itself.
                            The United States could not upset the power balance in Asia just to give
                            a present which might be appreciated for a few days by Japan. While the
                            job had to be done, the United States had to have Okinawa to do it. We
                            were willing to retire when it could be done safely but not willing to
                            retire just to give a Christmas present to Japan.</p>
                        <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0555"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we respect the <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> Government, of which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> was a part, and understood the
                            reality of politics. We wished to do what was helpful. However, Japan
                            should be satisfied, on the basis of our record, that her interests run
                            parallel with ours and that we do help each other. He said that there
                            was more ground for cooperation than was being utilized, probably for
                            fear of criticism by the Communists in Japan. He wished to point out
                            that Chancellor Adenauer had freely acknowledged the benefits of
                            cooperation with the United States and had not suffered, but on the
                            contrary had profited thereby. The United States wanted Japan to be
                            prosperous, strong and able to carry the responsibilities a free nation
                            must carry. The Secretary cautioned Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> that Japan should not try to force us out before
                            Japan was ready to pick up the load it was asking us to lay down. The
                            price of so doing could be the loss of Japan’s independence and the
                            retreat of the United States to its own west coast. That would result in
                            an unhappy world.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had spoken so frankly only because he
                            considered that he was talking to a friend and that it was his earnest
                            desire for Japan and the United States to find a basis for working
                            together.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said he wanted to use the
                            brief remaining time to make two things clear: (1) Japan would take no
                            neutralist stand like India but would bear its responsibility as a
                            member of the free world. (2) With respect to relations with Soviet
                            Russia and Red China, Japan was drawing a clear line between economic
                            and political relations. There was a trade and navigation agreement
                            presently under negotiation. Japan would not enter into a political
                            agreement such as the Soviets desired. Just prior to leaving Japan, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> had given orders to
                            formulate the new organization through which Japan planned to channel
                            all its relations with the Soviet Union. Favorable trade was more
                            important to Japan than getting back Okinawa and it was most important
                            that the United States help Japan to expand trade. The time was up but
                            he would like to say that on the basis of the thoughts exchanged today
                            with the Secretary, he would talk with other Cabinet ministers.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Secretary’s office, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Robertson</persName> asked about the Orissa project.<note n="4"

                                of Indian economic development.</note> Mr. <persName

                            visiting Japan, had expressed himself as more favorable to the concept.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Robertson</persName> urged that the
                            Japanese come to us whenever they had a concrete proposal.</p>

                                    rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 611.94/10–2157)</note> Mr. Way acted
                            as spokesman for the Department of Defense in the absence of Mr. Irwin
                            who was detained elsewhere until the meeting was almost over. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> presided.</p>
                        <p>Following an exchange of cordialities, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> said that when Finance Minister Ichimada was in the
                            United States recently he had discussed next year’s budget, and, in this
                            connection, Japan’s share of expenditures for United States forces in
                            Japan. Mr. Ichimada had brought this matter up because a large portion
                            of the United States forces was being withdrawn and expenses were
                            dropping. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> wanted it
                            understood that he himself was not trying to disturb the formula. The
                            formula had been agreed upon and it should be observed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Way said that he had been at the meeting between Finance Minister
                            Ichimada and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>,
                            when the Military Assistance Program had been discussed.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d242fn3">No record of this meeting has been found.</note>
                            Defense had indicated that there would be no change in policy for the
                            program but it would be necessary to consider the fact that Congress had
                            cut $500 million from the budget for this program. Priorities would have
                            to be considered and the greatest <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529"
                                facs="0557"/>importance would be given to situations where there was
                            war, where there was a suspended war or where there were threatening
                            friction patterns. In this context Japan would have a lower
                            priority.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that the following
                            year’s defense budget was being organized now in Japan. There would be
                            an increase of 20 billion yen over this year, one-half of which would be
                            covered by the United States according to the expense sharing formula.
                            Mr. Ichimada upon his return to Japan had said that he had indicated to
                            United States officials that he would like to have more than this
                            proportion covered by the United States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> asked whether Mr. Ichimada had in fact made this
                            suggestion. Mr. Way did not recall the details; however, he said that
                            the Finance Minister clearly had been anxious to put Japan in the best
                            possible financial condition, and his sentiment had been appreciated by
                            the Defense Department. There was throughout the United States
                            Government and in its Defense Department an awareness of Japan’s
                            economic difficulties. The Defense Department was glad to help in the
                            defense area through programs such as the Military Assistance Program,
                            and on such matters it worked closely with the Department of State. When
                            any policy decisions had to be made, however, a government position had
                            to be reached in the early stages.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that he and Mr.
                            Ichimada were close friends. Mr. Ichimada had reported that he had
                            reached agreement with United States Defense officials and that the
                            United States would cover one-half of Japan’s defense budget increase
                            because of the removal of combat forces from Japan. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that upon returning to Japan
                            he would have to defend Mr. Ichimada in the Cabinet. He wished to know
                            whether there had in fact been such an understanding.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Way did not think that Mr. Ichimada could have gotten such an idea
                            from his meeting with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> at the Defense Department. There must, he
                            thought, be some confusion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTF1"
                                >Matsumoto</persName> remarked that this was a very important point.
                            Misunderstanding could cause trouble in formulating the Japanese budget.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> stated that this matter
                            had not been discussed in any talks which Mr. Ichimada had here at the
                            State Department.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lehrer asked if Mr. Ichimada had indicated in his recent report to
                            Cabinet officials in Japan who in the Defense Department had given him
                            the impression that the United States was willing to change the formula.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said he had not named
                            anyone. He had merely stated he had gained the impression that since
                            United States forces were to be cut so drastically the United States
                            would cover not only the 10 billion yen required of it by the formula
                            but an additional 3 to 5 billion yen. Mr. Way said that so far as he
                            knew the point had not been discussed. The Defense Department could not
                            have consented to <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0558"/>such a
                            proposal without prior discussions with the Department of State. It
                            would probably be several months before Defense officials would have
                            available the facts essential for making any such decision.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said that he understood,
                            and that what Mr. Ichimada had told him then was not true. Nevertheless,
                            since the Japanese Government was formalizing its budget and since it
                            was following a tight money policy, no items except the defense item
                            were being increased. The defense increase was contra to the general
                            policy of economy. If Mr. Ichimada was wrong, and there was no new
                            agreement about the formula, then perhaps he may have gotten some other
                            agreement—possibly on mutual assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> added that it would be helpful it some such
                            agreement could be had.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Way stated that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> had informed Mr. Ichimada that all Finance
                            Ministers were searching for more money. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> had turned to Mr. Way and had asked him to
                            explain the formula. Officials in the Defense Department had expected
                            Mr. Ichimada to pay a courtesy call only and naturally they were not
                            prepared to give an answer to a specific question of this kind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lehrer remarked that the basis of the formula was that as the
                            Japanese self-defense forces grew they would take over increased
                            responsibility for the defense of Japan, permitting the progressive
                            withdrawal of United States forces from Japan. The United States share
                            of increased Japanese defense costs constituted an incentive to Japan to
                            assume more of the burden so that the United States could pull back its
                            own forces. The policy had proved successful, and its success should
                            constitute no cause for concern. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> accepted this position but pointed out that the
                            Finance Minister had a responsibility which he, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>, shared because of his general
                            responsibilities for Japanese economic planning. If the alleged
                            understanding with Ichimada did not exist perhaps the United States
                            might arrange some other assistance, for example on the P2V7’s. The
                            offer of such assistance would be helpful to the Japanese Government in
                            its defense of increased expenditures in the face of an austerity
                            budget. Mr. Way said that the Defense Department was working on this
                            matter. As to the formula it was too early to discuss it; another two
                            months at least were required.<note n="4" xml:id="d242fn4">For text of

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> remarked that this was
                            the first time he had had an opportunity to discuss this subject, and he
                            thought that what Mr. Way had said was very much to the point. However,
                            he was glad to have Minister <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                            >Kono</persName>’s views which would be given consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0559"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Lehrer</persName> said that United States costs had not
                            dropped proportionately in Japan with the reduction of United States
                            forces there. The reason for this was that the units which were least
                            costly to maintain had been or were being withdrawn. Meanwhile expenses
                            were rising on those units which remained in Japan. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> appreciated the point that Mr.
                            Lehrer had made. He said that whenever a Japanese representative
                            initiates a request it might appear to be opportunistic, but he hoped
                            that United States officials would realize that Japan had suffered last
                            year from an overexpanded budget.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Way</persName> said that the Defense Department had
                            appreciated its dealings with Japanese Government officials. Mr. Kaihara
                            of the Defense Agency was well liked in Washington and American Defense
                            officials were glad that he was coming here. His presence should be
                            helpful in future discussions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> asked for American
                            understanding. He said that since the Japanese Government had promised
                            to increase its defense budget it would do so, but he wanted the
                            American Government to know that the Japanese Government was in a very
                            painful position in light of its austerity program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Way</persName> said that the Defense Department was very
                            happy to see the $80 million increase in the <gloss target="#t_JSDF1"
                                >JSDF</gloss> budget. The American Government had been under
                            criticism for its large contributions to Japanese defense because Japan
                            itself was only putting 1.5% of its gross national product into its
                            defense forces whereas the United States puts about 10% of its gross
                            national product into defense purposes. Therefore, we were glad to see
                            Japan’s defense budget increasing this year. The increase was an
                            indication of the new understanding achieved when Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> visited Washington. American
                            officials would be happy to do what they could to make it easier for the
                            Japanese Government to get its proposed budget approved in the Japanese
                            Diet. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> said the details
                            would be covered in the Joint Committee in Tokyo. He would appreciate
                            whatever the United States could do to help. Mr. Way remarked that we
                            had a Congress, too, in the United States and he hoped that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> would understand the
                            problems which this entailed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> replied that 1.5% of the income of a poor nation
                            meant more to it than 15% of the income of a large nation. Mr. Way said
                            that he appreciated this fact and noted that the present contribution
                            which Japan made to the maintenance of United States forces in Japan was
                            down to one-half of what had been set in the original agreement of
                            1952.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Irwin</persName> closed the meeting with the statement that
                            Defense officials were glad to have had an opportunity to meet with
                            State Minister <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> and to hear
                            his ideas.</p>

                        <p>Governor Dewey requested a luncheon appointment with the Under Secretary
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>. The purpose of
                            his visit was primarily to discuss the reactions of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> to his recent visit to Washington.
                            Governor Dewey reported that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> had been extremely disturbed by his lack of success
                            in Washington and his inability to gain any sort of backing for his
                            project of Japanese-American collaboration in the development of
                            Southeast Asia. Governor Dewey said that he had informed Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> that he felt the Japanese
                            Government had made a mistake in not clearly indicating, by means of a
                            letter from the Prime Minister or some similar method, that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> was speaking on behalf of
                            the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister. He pointed out to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> that the U.S. Government normally
                            dealt with foreign governments through their Prime Ministers, Foreign
                            Ministers, or Ambassadors, and it was not possible to deal through other
                            political leaders no matter how important they might be.</p>
                        <p>Governor Dewey then said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> was very important in the Japanese political scene,
                            and that he personally felt that it was essential that something be done
                            to expand Japanese trade relations with Southeast Asia if the present
                            conservative government was to continue in Japan. He felt that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName>’s proposals were an
                            improvement over earlier proposals by <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> and others that the U.S. put up all the money for

                        <p>It was pointed out to Governor Dewey that there was real doubt as to
                            whether the countries of Southeast Asia were prepared for closer
                            cooperation with the Japanese on any broad scale basis. It was also
                            pointed out to him that it would be an unwise policy for the U.S. to
                            make any broad commitment to the Japanese to underwrite a Japanese
                            development program in Southeast Asia. Governor Dewey readily agreed
                            with the latter point but felt that it would be worthwhile for the U.S.
                            to make a real effort to promote greater Japanese activity in the area,
                            as this was the only way to maintain an economically viable Japan.</p>
                        <p>Governor Dewey was also told that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI1"
                                >Kono</persName> had been informed that the U.S. was prepared to
                            consider any specific project which the Japanese Government might
                            recommend and that the U.S. preferred to operate on the basis of
                            specific projects rather than any over-all basis.</p>
                        <p>When he left Governor Dewey indicated that he intended to write to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI1">Kono</persName> and inform them that he had
                            discussed Japanese problems with the Under Secretary and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, and suggest to Mr. <persName

                            contained in your letter of October 18.<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">Not
                                found. In a November 6 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_CR1"

                                    <persName corresp="#p_SCH1">SHUFF</persName> had “proposed (a)
                                that the Japanese Government be informed that the United States is
                                planning grant aid of about $50 million for FY 1958 with their
                                requirements for subsequent years to be financed by the purchase by
                                Japan from the United Sates for yen of military equipment under the
                                provisions of Section 103 (c) of the new <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                    >MAP</gloss> legislation; and (b) that a Defense negotiating
                                team be sent to Japan which would include representatives of the
                                three services to discuss the naval aircraft program proposed by the
                                Japanese, fighter and other aviation programs and other military
                                procurement programs such as the five-year Far East vehicle
                                production program.” (Attached to the source text)</note> I would
                            welcome an opportunity to discuss and explore this matter further since
                            your proposal seems to imply a basic shift in our Military Assistance
                            policy (<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>) towards Japan. We realize
                            that the reduction in the over-all <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            appropriation made at the last session of Congress requires adjustments
                            in many of our programs. However, we are most anxious that whatever
                            adjustments or changes are required in our program for Japan be made
                            with proper recognition of the fact that our <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> programs are important tools for achieving the
                            political as well as the strategic objectives of United States policy
                            towards Japan.</p>
                        <p>Without attempting to go into a detailed discussion of our views prior to
                            our meeting, I believe that the following considerations should be kept
                            in mind in viewing your proposal or any other major change in our <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> policy towards Japan.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> is the first
                            Japanese Prime Minister since the Peace Treaty to show evidence of a
                            real willingness to tackle the problem of building an adequate defense
                            force for Japan. During the past six months he has taken significant
                            steps in this direction. He has directed and obtained Cabinet approval
                            for both a basic defense policy and an official defense plan covering
                            Japanese fiscal years 1958 through 1960. He has formulated a defense
                            budget for Japanese fiscal year 1958 (beginning April 1, 1958) which
                            would provide an increase of 28.5 percent in funds over those
                            appropriated for <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1957. A further
                            substantial increase in the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_JFY1"
                                >JFY</gloss> 1958 defense budget would be required to support the
                            proposal contained in your letter. It is difficult to see how Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> could obtain the
                            additional funds required.</p>

                        <p>As pointed out by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"

                                    target="#d240">240</ref>.</note> the forthcoming few months may
                            be critical ones for Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> and it is in the interest of the United States to
                            help him build a further record of positive achievement in preparation
                            for the forthcoming elections. Conversely, we should examine with care
                            any proposal for a shift in our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            policy towards Japan if there is a likelihood of a possible adverse
                            reaction therefrom on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s political posture.</p>
                        <p>A specific example of helpful action on our part would be prompt
                            acceptance of the Japanese proposal to negotiate an arrangement for the
                            production of the <gloss target="#t_P2V1">P2V</gloss>–7 aircraft, which
                            we understand the Chief of Naval Operations has recommended to your
                            office. This proposal is the culmination of months of effort and
                            discussion between United States and Japanese representatives in Tokyo.
                            A large measure of the political benefit from this project will be lost
                            if acceptance is delayed until after the elections. Furthermore prompt
                            action on our part is needed if the Japanese Government is to include
                            provision for this program in the <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss>
                            1958 budget which will be finalized in late December for presentation to
                            the Diet when it convenes in January.</p>
                        <p>In our discussions in June with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> it was made clear to him that the United States
                            would no longer make suggestions to Japan concerning steps to be taken
                            by Japan in its defense build-up unless requested by the Japanese. Only
                            recently assurances were given to the Japanese by Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> and other United States
                            officials that there is no change in our <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> policy towards Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Three-Year Defense Plan has been formulated on the basis of
                            certain assumptions as to the continuance of military assistance from
                            the United States. For us to indicate a basic change in <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> policy towards Japan at this juncture
                            would tend to discredit the policies which the Prime Minister has
                            enunciated and could very well result not only in a reduction in the
                            proposed <gloss target="#t_JFY1">JFY</gloss> 1958 defense budget but
                            also in a sweeping downward reappraisal by the Japanese Government of
                            the Three-Year Defense Plan.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing we question the wisdom of sending a mission
                            to Tokyo to discuss with the Japanese the proposal outlined in your
                            letter until there has been basic inter-agency agreement, taking into
                            account the views of Embassy Tokyo, <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                                >CINCPAC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_COMUSJ1">COMUS Japan</gloss>,
                            on the policy to be followed by the United States in its <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> relations with Japan. We believe that
                            any discussions with the Japanese Government regarding our policy toward
                            Japan should be initiated by our Embassy and military representatives in
                            Tokyo rather than <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0564"/>by a mission
                            from Washington such as you propose. We have requested the Embassy’s

                            success with <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and Sputnik has had
                            serious unsettling effect on Japanese, particularly re their defense
                            situation. Socialists and extreme left are using Soviet success to

                            Japan’s existing defense setup is inadequate and that it is useless to

                            It is imperative that we also have constructive and realistic proposals
                            to put forward to Japanese for closer bilateral cooperation with them on
                            defense matters. If we do not have such proposals I fear it will be
                            interpreted here to mean that we are inclined to write them off. This
                            feeling will be compounded by necessity of our reducing existing US air
                            strength in Japan before Japanese have developed corresponding
                            capability for aid [<hi rend="italic">air</hi>?] defense.</p>
                        <p>Japanese have in past asked MAAG for missiles to use as basis for
                            developing their own modern weapons system but we understand chiefly
                            because of lack of Japanese security legislation we have felt obliged to
                            refuse. This explains their purchase of Oerlikon missile from
                            Switzerland and <gloss target="#t_JSDF1">JSDF</gloss> efforts now to
                            obtain missiles elsewhere reported in Air Attaché cable by approaching
                            British for De Havilland “Firestreak” and sending <gloss
                                target="#t_JSDF1">JSDF</gloss> mission to Europe. Let me emphasize,
                            however, <gloss target="#t_JSDF1">JSDF</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> want to cooperate with US rather than
                            Europeans.</p>
                        <p>Situation re Japanese security legislation is as follows:</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> wants and is determined for
                            his own reasons to have security legislation enacted. However, with
                            certainty of elections next year and possibly in spring, he will not
                            introduce legislation into Diet unless he is certain it will not give
                            Socialists issue which they can exploit to weaken his position. In light
                            present political situation here I doubt that he will introduce
                            legislation before elections. If introduction of legislation before
                            elections would work against him, I do not believe it would be in our
                            own interest have him do so.</p>
                        <p>Purpose of this cable is to urge that entire missile situation as it
                            affects Japan be reviewed in light of recent developments with objective
                            of offering to sell appropriate air to air missiles, and perhaps also

                            requesting further information and discussion of US policies in light of
                            Soviet development of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and
                            satellites. He said government policies have been challenged as result
                            of Soviet progress and it is therefore useful to discuss this
                            development at greater length in subsequent meetings of committee. I
                            agreed that a discussion of free world policies in light of Soviet
                            developments would be useful. <persName corresp="#p_FA1"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> thought Soviet successes may have important
                            psychological effect on free world and therefore free world “must
                            maintain firm mutual trust among themselves and confidence in
                            themselves”. <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> pointed out
                            that Soviet actions also have direct bearing on domestic political

                            attention on air defense problem. He expressed fear that possible
                            acceleration of US Air Force withdrawals from Japan and delays in
                            buildup of Japanese air force might bring about deficiency in air
                            defense. He <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0568"/>requested that US
                            withdrawal therefore be coordinated with Japanese buildup and that US
                            continue to provide assistance to Japan’s air force, including technical
                            aid and training.</p>

                            defense to Japan Air Self Defense Force. He emphasized that, during
                            current transitional stage when Japanese will begin operations within

                            He expressed opinion that Japan’s air defense will continue to be
                            reasonably effectively executed during this current transitional
                            period.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SGFHJ1">General Smith</persName> pointed out that
                            USAF plans were made well in advance in coordination with original
                            program for Japanese air force buildup which is now behind schedule. He
                            agreed that we should avoid creating vacuum during transitional phase,
                            and in this connection mentioned that two fighter squadrons scheduled
                            for inactivation next summer will be kept here extra year. He emphasized
                            US at same time cannot always be depended upon to fill gap left by
                            delays in Japanese buildup and urged further efforts by Japanese,
                            particularly in meeting schedule for transfer of AC and W sites.

                            Ryukyus recently amended certain ordinances and laws to permit the City
                            Assembly of Naha to remove Mayor Kamejiro Senaga from office and to
                            prevent his re-election.<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">The removal of

                            Department of State concurred, in haste, in the necessity and the
                            specific plan for the removal of Mr. Senaga. However, we believe that it
                            could have been accomplished with less repercussion had there been time
                            for adequate groundwork, particularly in Japan.</p>
                        <p>As you know, serious consideration had been given on at least two
                            occasions since December 25, 1956 to the removal of Mr. Senaga.<note

                            who was Governor of the Ryukyu Islands, that the Naha City Assembly
                            should be given the opportunity to solve the problem in accordance with
                            their own procedures. Reports which we have received from Naha in recent
                            months had indicated that the City Assembly was having great difficulty
                            in accomplishing its objective of removing Mr. Senaga from office.
                            However, there was no indication in any reports that the High
                            Commissioner was prepared to take action in connection with this

                            afternoon on November 21. I sent an immediate inquiry regarding the
                            matter to the Consul General in Naha<note n="4" xml:id="d249fn4"

                            inform General Moore that the Department of State considered it
                            necessary for the action to be reviewed in full by interested Washington
                            agencies before any action was taken. Unfortunately, this message was
                            received in Naha after General Moore’s action had been taken. Again,
                            late in the afternoon of November 22, [<hi rend="italic">less <pb

                            that General Moore intended to take the action at 9:00 p.m., Washington
                            time, on November 22. The report which we received indicated that Mr.
                            Senaga would be declared ineligible for office as a result of having
                            been convicted of a felony.</p>
                        <p>With only about three hours remaining before the action was reportedly
                            scheduled, I called Assistant Secretary of the Army Roderick. He, too,
                            had heard nothing about the matter, and his inquiry indicated that the
                            entire Pentagon was uninformed. When he talked to <persName

                            immediately talked to General Moore by telephone. General Moore was
                            agreeable to delaying the action for a few hours to allow the
                            Departments of State and Defense to read and to evaluate his message,

                            which described the action he proposed to take.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of Saturday, November 23, I considered with members of my
                            staff the action proposed. Though the time permitted for evaluation was
                            short, I concurred on behalf of the Department on the desirability of
                            accepting the proposal. The need for the speed which General Moore was
                            urging involved the fact that the City Assembly in its final week of
                            meeting was proposing to take an action which the experts judged would
                            not stand up under the test of court review. I recommended that if it
                            were possible to work the matter out with the majority members of the
                            City Assembly so that they would not take action on their own, General
                            Moore delay his action two or three days to permit the United States
                            Government to brief Embassy and USIS posts abroad. This would permit
                            them to provide the necessary background information to interested
                            governments and be prepared for the press inquiries which would
                            inevitably follow the announcement of the action in Naha.</p>
                        <p>Apparently General Moore was unable to arrange this delay, since his
                            action was taken on Sunday, November 24, and the follow-up action by the
                            City Assembly occurred on Monday, November 25. The expected public
                            reaction, particularly in Japan, occurred. For two or three days stories
                            about the United States action in ousting Mayor Senaga crowded all other
                            news off the front pages of all newspapers in Tokyo. The Japanese press
                            uniformly and vigorously protested the method of effecting the removal
                            of Mayor Senaga. It was called undemocratic and “dictatorial” and was
                            pointed out as an example of the lack of practice of democracy by the
                            United States.</p>
                        <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0574"/>
                        <p>The uproar in Japan might have been avoided had we been informed of the
                            High Commissioner’s plans in time to give the Japanese Government
                            advance briefing and to provide preparatory background material to other
                            interested posts. The Consul General in Naha has informed us that,
                            although he was consulted from the early stages regarding the High
                            Commissioner’s thinking on this subject, he was under injunction not to
                            transmit any separate communications to the Department on the subject.
                            The High Commissioner explained his injunction as follows: The decision
                            to obtain the removal of Senaga by changing the local autonomy laws was
                            his to make; consequently, he was not going to consult the Department of
                            Defense beforehand. Accordingly, news of his proposed action should not
                            reach Washington prematurely through other channels.</p>
                        <p>Succumbing to such a position on the part of the High Commissioner makes
                            it difficult, if not impossible, for the Department of State to carry
                            out its responsibilities under Section 3 of Executive Order 10713 of
                            June 5, 1957, which states: “The Secretary of State shall be responsible
                            for the conduct of relations with foreign countries and international
                            organizations with respect to the Ryukyu Islands.”</p>
                        <p>We had thought that there was a clear understanding in the Ryukyus of the
                            Consul General’s responsibility for independent reporting to the
                            Department on development in the Ryukyus and of his need to communicate
                            on such matters to the Department of State. Such reporting is essential
                            for the Department of State to assess the impact of developments and
                            proposed actions in the Ryukyus on the foreign policy of the United
                            States and on United States relations with other countries. I believe it
                            is desirable to remind the High Commissioner of the importance of full
                            reporting, particularly by the Consul General, on all developments and
                            proposed actions which could have implications for or bring reactions on
                            United States foreign policy or international relations.</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing a proposed joint State–Defense message<note n="6"

                                    >Robertson</persName></hi>: Thank you for your letter of 4
                            November 1957,<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">See <ref target="#d228fn3"
                                    >footnote 3, Document 228</ref>.</note> addressed to my Deputy,
                            John N. Irwin, in which you describe the action taken by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concerning
                            repatriation of former residents of the Bonin Islands.</p>
                        <p>Your letter advises that the Department of State does not agree that the
                            Japanese Government should share in the compensation for the reasons
                            that it would nullify the political objective we are seeking of
                            eliminating repatriation pressure, and that it would offset any
                            political capital the <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> regime
                            might develop from our agreement to compensate.</p>
                        <p>In our opinion there are cogent reasons, other than the obvious one that
                            Japan originally evicted the former land owners, for advocating that the
                            Japanese Government share equally or partially in the compensation.
                            First, by sharing the cost, both sides in the negotiation maintain an
                            interest in keeping the amount of compensation to a minimum, an
                            important factor to be considered in justifying any appropriation
                            request before Congress. A second advantage would be that by sharing,
                            the possible connotation of a conscience payment implying sole United
                            States responsibility, would be avoided. Lastly, by sharing, charges by
                            the Japanese political opposition that the U.S. is “buying” the islands
                            would be averted. If compensation is paid unilaterally there is the
                            concomitant inference that Japanese sovereignty is thereby terminated
                            despite the fact that the U.S. has affirmed Japan’s residual
                            sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the above, the Department of Defense defers to the
                            judgment of the Department of State in developing the best means of
                            attaining a desirable political arrangement in this matter. Since
                            political considerations have overriding priority, it is assumed that
                            the Department of State will take the lead in sponsoring and justifying
                            the necessary Congressional appropriation.</p>
                        <p>The technical details of our proposed plan for indemnification, which
                            would be applicable to either a cost-sharing or a unilateral payment
                            basis, has already been communicated to your Department at a staff
                            level. It proposes that the value of the land be determined by a search
                            of the records of land transfers in the Bonins, or if not available, <pb
                                n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0576"/>by taking the value of
                            comparable land in Japan or the Ryukyus. The value of equivalent land in
                            Okinawa has been assessed at one thousand and sixty dollars an acre; a
                            Bonins settlement based on this evaluation would be $3,837,200.

                            following statement here yesterday which appeared in local press today:

                                <p>“That the US will find it necessary to continue the present
                                    status in the Ryukyus ‘as long as conditions of threat and
                                    tension exist in the Far East’ is national policy. Since these
                                    tensions are caused by the Communists, the fact that we will be
                                    here ‘indefinitely’ or ‘for the foreseeable future’ still is not
                                    understood by a great many people—particularly by those who do
                                    not wish to understand.</p>
                                <p>“I feel our fundamental need is for an authoritative statement of

                                    under which we can operate. The combination of these actions
                                    would remove current doubts and confusion, make clear to
                                    Okinawans, and others, what their status is, and permit them to

                                    on December 19 in which the Foreign Minister had pointed out the
                                    difficulties created for the Japanese Government by Moore’s
                                    statement in view of the fact that Japan itself had previously
                                    wanted to set a terminal date for both the occupation of the
                                    Ryukyus and the duration of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.
                                    According to <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName>,
                                    Moore’s statement was being interpreted by many in Japan to mean
                                    that after expiration of the time limit suggested by Moore,
                                    reversion would be actively discussed. <persName

                            its political position but faces economic difficulties. Externally USSR
                            expected to continue policy on “peaceful co-existence” and easing of
                            tensions while exploiting recent scientific successes particularly on
                            psychological front. Communist Chinese regime considered politically
                            strong but facing serious economic difficulties. Communist
                            Chinese-Soviet ties are viewed as very close; Japanese feel that
                            Sino-Soviet negotiations to provide Communist China with modern weapons
                            probably undertaken recently.</p>

                                corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> expressed appreciation for my
                            presentation since Japanese government attached great importance to our
                            views on Soviet bloc. He raised several questions relating to background
                            of Zhukov ouster and to tactics employed by free world to exploit
                            current Communist Chinese economic difficulties. On latter point,
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> questioned whether it
                            might not be preferable for free world to try to exploit these economic
                            difficulties through increased free world trade with ChiComs which would
                            tend to separate them from USSR. In reply, I pointed out Chinese
                            Communist-Soviet ties based on far more than Chinese economic dependence
                            on USSR and that increased ChiCom trade with West likely to result in
                            strengthening Chinese regime and opening way for expansionist efforts in
                            South and Southeast Asia to detriment of free world and particularly
                            Japan. I agreed one of our general objectives should be dividing ChiComs
                            from USSR but stressed we did not feel this objective could be currently
                            achieved through efforts to lessen ChiCom economic dependence on USSR.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> expressed interest in
                            further discussion of ways and means to divide ChiComs and USSR.</p>
                        <p>II —“Implications of recent Soviet scientific developments and free world
                            policies in light thereof”—In opening discussion of this agenda item,
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA1">Fujiyama</persName> stressed Soviets are
                            making fullest use of scientific successes in propaganda field and not
                            without results in Japan. He stated Japanese feel that military balance
                            has not been immediately affected by Soviet developments but Russians
                            currently have lead in field of long range missiles. Since US
                            superiority in military science is considered key to maintenance of
                            world peace and security, Japan considers main question is whether US
                            will catch up by 1960 when, they understand, Soviet <gloss

                        <p>Spiritual unity of free world is also felt to be currently more important
                            in order to cope with Communist political and psychological offensive.
                            Defense Agency Director-General Tsushima spoke along similar lines,
                            commenting that Soviet military strength constitutes grave threat to
                            Japan, particularly since Soviets expected to furnish missiles to
                            ChiComs and North Korea. However, in view continued strength of US
                            deterrent power, Defense Agency believes Communists will resort
                            psychological and other Cold War tactics although possibility of
                            localized aggression cannot be discounted. <persName corresp="#p_TJ1"
                                >Tsushima</persName> said in conclusion that Defense Agency will
                            continue build up along lines of current 3-year plan but modernization
                            of weapons also required.</p>

                                billion yen which could be expected by application of the revised

                                increase in Japan’s defense expenditures, problem of percentage

                                    with beginning of this year, Japanese public will expect their
                                    local costs will also be curtailed to similar extent and yen
                                    contribution will be cut down accordingly.” According to

                            confined to reporting of statements made by him, and stories presumably
                            inspired by Finance Ministry, to effect that reduction US forces
                            logically leads to reduction in yen contribution over and above the
                            formula amount and that US will be asked to agree to such reduction.
                            Therefore to certain extent expectations have been built up in minds of
                            both politicians and public and of course any such reduction would have
                            popular and political appeal.</p>

                            and unjustified by facts of present situation. These efforts did not
                            prevent official approach being made to me but they may have moderated
                            somewhat extent to which <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has so far
                            committed itself to obtaining additional reduction.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt in my mind that <persName corresp="#p_FA1"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> is right in saying such additional reduction
                            over and above formula amount will be political advantage to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> in pre-electoral period. At same
                            time failure to get it may not be too great political disadvantage
                            unless issue becomes built up in press as first-class conflict between
                            two governments which has thus far not happened. Foregoing factors, and
                            lack of any really good case for additional reduction unless it matter
                            of overriding necessity to avoid very significant damage to <persName

                                <item>Present Japanese argument is that as our forces go down their
                                    contribution should be reduced over and above reduction
                                    resulting from application of formula. This overlooks important
                                    point of entire defense relationship, i.e. that reduction in our
                                    forces is related to increase in Japanese defense capabilities.
                                    Division of our costs in Japan discussed at great length various
                                    times in past and conclusion reached that most easily measured
                                    yardstick of Japanese increase is defense budget. Application of
                                    formula thus already takes account of decrease in US forces.
                                    Unreasonable, therefore, that there should be additional
                                    reduction on this ground.</item>

                            to $155 million per annum, “until the effective date of any new
                            arrangement reached as a result of periodic re-examination”. Annex G to
                            the Agreement provides that the specific amount should be agreed
                            annually by the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese contribution has been gradually reduced as a result of
                            annual negotiations. In order to provide for a systematic reduction as
                            the Japanese forces were increased and to avoid acrimonious
                            negotiations, a formula was agreed upon on April 25, 1956 (Tab C)<note

                        <p>On December 31, Japan and the Republic of Korea signed understandings on
                            a number of questions which had been at issue between the two countries.
                            They agreed to exchange detainees, to resume general negotiations in
                            March 1958, and to be guided in reaching a property settlement by a
                            United States interpretation of Article IV (of the Japanese Peace
                            Treaty) which the United States had presented informally to both
                            countries. Documentation indicates that the United States was frequently
                            active in urging talks between the two countries, and in making
                            substantive suggestions, but that United States officials did not serve
                            either as formal mediators or informal go-betweens during the 1955–1957
                            period. Principal documentation is in Department of State, Central Files
                            295.9411 and 694.95B.</p>
